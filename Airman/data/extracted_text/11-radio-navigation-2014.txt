Introduction
Radio and radar systems are now an integral and essential part of aviation, without which 
the current intensity of air transport operations would be unsustainable.  In the early days of 
aviation aircraft were flown with visual reference to the ground and flight at night, in cloud or 
over the sea was not possible.  As the complexity of aircraft increased it became necessary to 
design navigational systems to permit aircraft to operate without reference to terrain features.
The early systems developed were, by modern standards very basic and inaccurate.  They 
provided reasonable navigational accuracy for en route flight over land, but only a very 
limited service over the oceans, and, until about 40 years ago, flight over the oceans used the 
traditional seafarer’s techniques of astro-navigation, that is using sights taken on the sun, moon, 
stars and planets to determine position.  Developments commenced in the 1910s, continued 
at an increasing rate during the 1930s and 1940s and up to the present day leading to the 
development of long range systems which by the 1970s were providing a global navigation 
service.
It is perhaps ironic that, having forsaken navigation by the stars, the most widely used navigation 
systems in the last few years are once again space based, that is the satellite navigation systems 
we now take as being the norm.  Whilst global satellite navigation systems (GNSS) are becoming 
the standard in aviation and many advocate that they will replace totally all the terrestrial 
systems, the ICAO view is that certain terrestrial systems will have to be retained to back up 
GNSS both for en route navigation and runway approaches.
The development of radar in the 1930s allowed air traffic control systems to be developed 
providing a control service capable of identifying and monitoring aircraft such that aircraft 
operations can be safely carried out at a much higher intensity than would be otherwise 
possible.  Modern satellite technology is being used to provide a similar service over oceans 
and land areas where the provision of normal radar systems is not possible.
The Radio Navigation Syllabus
The syllabus starts by looking at the nature of radio waves and how they travel through the 
atmosphere.  This is essential to understand why different radio frequencies are selected for 
particular applications and also the limitations imposed. The introductory chapters also cover 
how radio waves are produced, transmitted, received and how information is added to and 
recovered from radio waves.
Electromagnetic (EM) Radiation
If a direct electric current (DC) is passed through a wire then a magnetic field is generated 
around the wire perpendicular to the current flow.
If an alternating electric current (AC) is passed through the wire then, because the direction of 
current flow is changing, the polarity of the magnetic field will also change, reversing polarity 
as the current direction reverses.  At low frequencies the magnetic field will return to zero with 
the current, but as frequency increases the magnetic field will not have collapsed completely 
before the reversed field starts to establish itself and energy will start to travel outwards from 
the wire in the form of electromagnetic radiation i.e. radio waves.

Properties of Radio Waves
The resulting EM energy is made up of two components, an electrical (E) field parallel to the 
wire and a magnetic (H) field perpendicular to the wire.
Figure 1.1 Vertical polarization
Polarization
The polarization of radio waves is defined as the plane of the electric field and is dependent 
on the plane of the aerial.  A vertical aerial will emit radio waves with the electrical field in 
the vertical plane and hence produce a vertically polarized wave, and a horizontal aerial will 
produce a horizontally polarized wave.
To receive maximum signal strength from an incoming radio wave it is essential the receiving 
aerial is in the same plane as the polarization of the wave, so a vertically polarized radio wave 
would require a vertical aerial.
Circular polarization can be produced in a variety of ways, one of which is using a helical antenna. 
In circular polarization the electrical (and hence magnetic) field rotates at the frequency of the 
radio wave.  The rotation may be right handed or left handed dependent on the orientation 
of the aerial array.
For reception of a circularly polarized wave an aerial of the same orientation is required, or a 
simple dipole aerial.  There are two significant advantages.  Firstly in radar systems, if circular 
polarization is used, when the energy is reflected from water droplets the circularity is reversed 
and therefore the ‘clutter’ caused by precipitation can be eliminated.  Secondly, if a dipole 
aerial is used the orientation of the aerial is no longer critical, as it is with linear polarization, 
and, clearly, this will be a major advantage in mobile systems, such as cellular phones and 
satellite communication and navigation systems.

Radio Waves
The length of time it takes to generate one cycle of a radio wave is known as the period 
and is generally signified by the Greek letter tau (τ), and measured in microseconds (µs).
(1 µs = 10-6 second).
Figure 1.2 Sinusoidal wave - period
If, for example, the period of one cycle of a radio wave is 0.125 µs then the number of cycles 
produced in one second would be the reciprocal of this giving:
	
	
This is known as the frequency (f) of the wave; hence:	
	
	
	
                      	 	
	
(1)	
     
The frequency of radio waves is expressed in hertz (Hz).  Since the order of magnitude of the 
frequency of radio waves is very high, for convenience, the following terms are used to express 
the frequency:
Kilohertz (kHz)	
=	
103 Hz	 =	
1 000 Hz
Megahertz (MHz)	
=	
106 Hz	 =	
1 000 000 Hz
Gigahertz (GHz)	
=	
109 Hz	 =	
1 000 000 000 Hz
So in the example above the frequency would be expressed as 8 MHz.
   =   8 000 000 cycles per second which are known as hertz (Hz)

Properties of Radio Waves
Wavelength
The speed of radio waves (c) is the same as the speed of light (which is also EM radiation) and 
is approximately:
300 000 000 ms-1 (= 300 × 106 ms-1), or 162 000 nautical miles per second
Figure 1.3 Sinusoidal wave - wavelength
Wavelength (λ ) 
If a radio wave travels at 300 × 106 ms-1 and the period is 0.125 µs, then the length (λ) of each 
wave will be:
            λ
= c. τ
	 	
	
	
	
(2)
	
300 × 106 × 0.125 × 10-6 = 37.5 m
This is known as the wavelength.  From equation (1) this can also be stated as:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
  	
       	
	
	
Giving:
	
	
       
Hence if the frequency is known then the wavelength can be determined and if the wavelength 
is known then the frequency can be calculated from:

Examples:
1.	
If the frequency of a radio wave is 121.5 MHz calculate the wavelength.
 	
2.	
If the wavelength is 1515 m, what is the corresponding frequency?
 	
	
For ease of calculation we can simplify the formulae:
	
	
But we must ensure that our input arguments are correct, i.e. to calculate the frequency the 
wavelength must be in metres and to calculate the wavelength the frequency must be input 
in MHz.
Examples:
3.	
Determine the frequency corresponding to a wavelength of 3.2 cm.
	
Noting that 3.2 cm = 0.032 m the calculation becomes:

Phase Comparison
Some radio navigation systems use the comparison of phase between two signals to define 
navigational information.  The first important point is that the two signals being compared 
must have the same frequency, otherwise any phase comparison would be meaningless.  The 
second point is that one signal will be designated the reference signal and the other a variable 
signal and that the comparison must yield a positive result.
Figure 1.4 Sinusoidal wave - phase comparison
To determine the phase difference between 2 signals, first identify the position of (for example) 
zero phase on each of the waves, then move in the positive direction from the chosen point 
on the reference wave to measure the phase angle through which the reference wave has 
travelled before zero phase is reached on the variable wave.
In this example, starting at zero phase on the reference wave (point A), we observe that the 
reference wave has travelled through a phase angle of 270° before zero phase is reached on 
the variable wave (point B), hence the phase difference is 270°.
The relationship can also be found mathematically.  At the origin the phase of the reference 
wave is 0° (= 360°) and the phase of the variable wave is 090°.  Subtracting the instantaneous 
phase of the variable wave from the instantaneous phase of the reference wave gives the same 
result, note the result must always be positive.
Reference – variable = 360° – 90° = 270°
Note: The phase difference must be positive, so if the calculation yields a negative result simply 
add 360° to get a positive answer.

Radio Propagation Theory
Introduction
In the context of radio waves the term propagation simply means how the radio waves travel 
through the atmosphere.  Different frequency bands use different propagation paths through 
the atmosphere; the propagation path often determines the uses to which a particular 
frequency band can be put in either communication or navigation systems. The different 
propagation paths associated with particular frequencies can also impose limitations on the 
use of those frequencies.
Factors Affecting Propagation
There are several factors which affect the propagation of radio waves and need to be considered 
when discussing the propagation paths:
Attenuation 
Attenuation is the term given to the loss of signal strength in a radio wave as it travels outward 
from the transmitter.  There are two aspects to attenuation:
Absorption 
As the radio wave travels outwards from a transmitter the energy is absorbed and scattered by 
the molecules of air and water vapour, dust particles, water droplets, vegetation, the surface 
of the earth and the ionosphere.  The effect of this absorption, (except ionospheric) increases 
as frequency increases and is a very significant factor above about 1000 MHz.
Inverse Square Law 
The EM radiation from an aerial spreads out as the surface of a sphere so the power available 
decreases with increasing distance from the transmitter.  For example, if, at a certain distance 
from a transmitter, the field intensity is 4 Wm-2 at double the distance that energy will be 
spread over an area of 4 m2 and the field intensity will be 1 Wm-2.  That is, power available is 
proportional to the inverse of the square of the range.

The practical effect of this is that if it is required to double the effective range of a transmitter 
then the power would have to be increased by a factor of 4.
Static Interference 
There is a large amount of static electricity generated in the atmosphere by weather, human 
activity and geological activity.  The effect of static interference is greater at lower frequencies 
whereas at VHF and above the effect of interference is generally negligible.  However, radio 
waves travelling through the ionosphere will collect interference at all frequencies.  Additionally 
the circuitry in the receivers and transmitters also produces static interference.  The static, from 
whatever source, reduces the clarity of communications and the accuracy of navigation systems. 
The strength of the required signal compared to the amount of interference is expressed as a 
signal to noise ratio (S/N) and for the best clarity or accuracy the unwanted noise needs to be 
reduced to the lowest possible levels.
Fading
Transmissions following different paths can occur for a number of reasons, e.g. reflections, 
and can arrive at a receiver simultaneously; however, the two signals will not necessarily be in 
phase. In extreme cases the two signals will be in anti-phase and will cancel each other out. 
Signals going in and out of phase are indicated by alternate fading and strengthening of the 
received signal.
Power  
An increase in the power output of a transmitter will increase the range, within the limits of the 
inverse square law.  As noted above, to double the range of a radio transmitter would require 
the power to be increased by a factor of 4.
Receiver Sensitivity  
If internal noise in a receiver can be reduced then the receiver will be able to process weaker 
signals hence increasing the effective range at which a useable signal can be received. However, 
this is an expensive process.
Directivity  
If the power output is concentrated into a narrow beam then there will be an increase in range, 
or a reduction in power required for a given range.  However the signal will only be usable in 
the direction of the beam.

Ionospheric propagation is propagation affected by the properties of the ionosphere. At 
this stage it is only necessary to discuss sky wave, satellite propagation will be considered 
in conjunction with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) in Chapter 18.  Knowledge of 
propagation below 30 kHz is not required.
Non-ionospheric propagation covers the other propagation paths.
Non-ionospheric Propagation
Surface Wave
Surface wave propagation exists at frequencies from about 20 kHz to about 50 MHz (from the 
upper end of VLF to the lower end of VHF). The portion of the wave in contact with the surface 
of the earth is retarded causing the wave to bend round the surface of the earth; a process 
known as diffraction.
Figure 2.3 Surface Wave
--- Page 28 ---
Radio Propagation Theory

2
Radio Propagation Theory
The range achievable is dependent on several factors: the frequency, the surface over which 
the wave is travelling and the polarization of the wave.  As the frequency increases, surface 
attenuation increases and the surface wave range decreases; it is effectively non-existent above 
HF.
The losses to attenuation by the surface of the earth are greater over land than over sea, 
because the sea has good electrical conductivity.  Hence greater ranges are attainable over the 
sea.  A horizontally polarized wave will be attenuated very quickly and give very short ranges; 
therefore, vertical polarization is generally used at these lower frequencies.

a frequency of 300 kHz is given by:
Sea:

So, for example, a 300 kHz transmitter with a power output of 10 kW would give a surface 
wave range of about 300 NM over the sea and 200 NM over the land.

Space Wave
The space wave is made up of two paths, a direct wave and a reflected wave.
Figure 2.5 Space wave
At frequencies of VHF and above radio waves start to behave more like visible light and as we 
have a visual horizon with light we have a radio horizon with the radio frequencies.  So the only 
atmospheric propagation at these frequencies is line of sight.
TX
RX
Figure 2.6 Maximum theoretical range
There is some atmospheric refraction which causes the radio waves to bend towards the 
surface of the earth increasing the range slightly beyond the geometric horizon.  Since the 
diameter of the earth is known and the atmospheric refraction can be calculated it is possible 
to determine the maximum theoretical range at which a transmission can be received.  The 
amount of refraction decreases as frequency increases but for practical purposes for the EASA 
syllabus the line of sight range can be calculated using the formula:
Range (NM)  =   1.23  ×  (√hTX  +  √hRX)    
hTX  : Transmitter height in feet
hRX  : Receiver height in feet
At VHF and above it does not matter how powerful the transmitter is, if the receiver is below 
the line of sight range, it will receive nothing.

For example:
What is the maximum range a receiver at 1600 ft can receive VHF transmissions from a 
transmitter at 1024 ft?
Range  =   1.23  ×  (√1600  +  √1024)   =   1.23  ×  (40 + 32)   =   88.6 NM
Note 1:  Regardless of the possible propagation paths, if a receiver is in line of sight 	
with a transmitter, then the space wave will be received.
Ionospheric Propagation
Before studying ionospheric propagation it is necessary to know about the processes which 
produce the ionization in the upper atmosphere and the properties of the ionosphere that 
produce sky wave.
The Ionosphere  
The ionosphere extends upwards from an altitude of about 60 km to limits of the atmosphere 
(notionally 1500 km).  In this part of the atmosphere the pressures are very low (at 60 km the 
atmospheric pressure is 0.22 hPa) and hence the gaseous atoms are widely dispersed.  Within 
this region incoming solar radiation at ultra-violet and shorter wavelengths interacts with the 
atoms raising their energy levels and causing electrons to be ejected from the shells of the 
atoms.  Since an atom is electrically neutral, the result is negatively charged electrons and 
positively charged particles known as ions.
The electrons are continually attempting to reunite with the ions, so the highest levels of 
ionization will be found shortly after midday (about 1400) local time, when there is a balance 
between the ionization and the decay of the ionization with the electrons rejoining the ions 
and the lowest just before sunrise (at the surface).  In summer the ionization levels will be 
higher than in winter, and ionization levels will increase as latitude decreases, again because of 
the increased intensity of the solar radiation.  
Increased radiation from solar flares is unpredictable but can give rise to exceptionally high 
levels of ionization, which in turn can cause severe disruption of communication and navigation 
systems, particularly those which are space based.  It is not unusual for communication (and 
other) satellites to be shut down during periods of intense solar flare activity to avoid damage.
As the incoming solar energy is absorbed by the gaseous atoms the amount of energy available 
to ionize the atoms at lower levels reduces and hence the levels of ionization increase with 
increase in altitude.  However, because the normal atmospheric mixing processes associated 
with the lower levels of the atmosphere are absent in the higher levels, gravitation and terrestrial 
magnetism affect the distribution of gases.  This means that the increase in ionization is not 
linear but the ionized particles form into discrete layers.

D LAYER 
Figure 2.7 Effect of ionisation with height
The ionization is most intense at the centre of the layers decreasing towards the lower and 
upper edges of the layers.  The characteristics of these layers vary with the levels of ionization. 
The lowest of these layers occurs at an average altitude of 75 km and is known as the D-region 
or D-layer.  This is a fairly diffuse area which, for practical purposes, forms at sunrise and 
disappears at sunset.  The next layer, at an average altitude of 125 km, is present throughout the 
24 hours and is known as the E-layer.  The E-layer reduces in altitude at sunrise and increases in 
altitude after sunset.  The final layer of significance is the F-layer at an average altitude of 225 
km.  The F-layer splits into two at sunrise and rejoins at sunset, the F1-layer reducing in altitude 
at sunrise and increasing in altitude after sunset.  The behaviour of the F2-layer is dependent 
on time of year, in summer it increases in altitude and may reach altitudes in excess of 400 km 
and in winter it reduces in altitude.

Radio Propagation Theory
Figure 2.8 Layers of the ionosphere
Although, overall the levels of ionization increase from sunrise to midday local time and then 
decrease until sunrise the following morning, the levels are continually fluctuating as the 
intensity of high energy radiation from the sun fluctuates.  So it would be possible for the 
ionization levels to decrease temporarily during the morning, or increase temporarily during 
the afternoon.
The structure of the ionosphere gives stable conditions by day and by night.  Around dawn 
and dusk, however, the ionosphere is in a transitional state, which leads to what can best be 
described as electrical turbulence.  The result is that around dawn and dusk, radio navigation 
and communication systems using the ionosphere are subject to excessive interference and 
disruption.

Sky Wave
The ionization levels in the layers increase towards the centre of the layer.  This means that as a 
radio wave transits a layer it encounters an increasing density of ions as it moves to the centre 
of the layer and decreasing density as it moves out of the layer.  If the radio waves travel across 
the layer at right angles they will be retarded, but will maintain a straight path.  However, if 
the waves penetrate the layer at an angle they will be refracted away from the normal as they 
enter, then back towards the normal as they exit the layer.
Figure 2.9 Sky wave propagation - critical angle
The amount of refraction experienced by the radio waves is dependent on both the frequency 
and the levels of ionization.  If the radio wave refracts to the (earth) horizontal before it reaches 
the centre of the layer then it will continue to refract and will return to the surface of the earth 
as sky wave; this is total internal refraction at the layer.
Starting from the vertical at the transmitter, with a frequency which penetrates the ionosphere, 
as the angle between the vertical and the radio wave increases, an angle will be reached where 
total internal refraction occurs and the wave returns to the surface.  This is known as the first 
returning sky wave and the angle (measured from the vertical) at which this occurs is known 
as the critical angle.  The distance from the transmitter to the point where the first returning 
sky wave appears at the surface is known as the skip distance.  As sky waves occur in the LF, MF 
and HF frequency bands there will also be some surface wave present.  From the point where 
the surface wave is totally attenuated to the point where the first returning sky wave appears 
there will be no detectable signal, this area is known as dead space.
--- Page 34 ---
Radio Propagation Theory

Radio Propagation Theory
Figure 2.10 Sky wave propagation - dead space
The height at which full internal refraction occurs is dependent on frequency, but, as a 
generalization frequencies up to 2 MHz will be refracted at the E-layer and from 2 – 50 MHz at 
the F-layers.  Sky wave is only likely to occur above 50 MHz when there are abnormal ionospheric 
conditions associated with intense sunspot or solar flare activity, therefore, VHF frequencies 
used for navigation systems do not produce sky waves.
Effect of Change in Ionization Intensity 
Since the reason for the refraction is the ionization of the upper atmosphere it follows that if 
ionization intensity changes, then the amount of refraction of radio waves will also change. 
At a given frequency, as ionization increases the refractive index and hence the amount of 
refraction affecting the radio waves will also increase.  This means that refraction will take place 
at a smaller critical angle and the skip distance and dead space will decrease.  Conversely, a 
decrease in ionization will result in an increase in critical angle, skip distance and dead space.

Figure 2.11 Sky wave propagation - effect of increased ionization
Effect of Change of Frequency  
For a given ionization intensity, the amount of refraction of radio waves decreases as frequency 
increases, because as frequency increases the energy contained in the radio wave increases and 
therefore refraction decreases.  So, as frequency increases, the critical angle will increase and 
the skip distance and dead space will also increase.  As frequency increases, the surface wave 
range will decrease, so there is an increase in dead space caused by both the increase in skip 
distance and decrease in surface wave range.  Conversely, a decrease in frequency will give a 
decrease in critical angle, skip distance and dead space.
Height of the Layers  
The skip distance will also be affected by the altitude of the refracting layers.  As the altitude 
of the layer increases then the skip distance will also increase and greater ranges will be 
experienced by refraction at the F-layer than the E-layer.

LF and MF Sky Wave Propagation  
During the day the D-layer absorbs radio energy at frequencies below about 2 MHz (LF and 
MF bands).  At night the D-layer is effectively non-existent so, at these frequencies, sky waves, 
refracted at the E-layer are present.  This means the sky waves at LF and MF are not reliable for 
continuous long range use and the presence of sky waves at night at the relatively short ranges 
associated with these lower frequencies will cause interference with short range navigation 
(and broadcasting) systems relying on surface wave reception.  This affects ADF and will be 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.

Achievable Ranges 
The maximum range for sky wave will be achieved when the path of the radio wave is tangential 
at the surface of the earth at both the transmitter and receiver.
A simple calculation shows that the average maximum range for refraction from the E-layer at 
125 km is 1350 NM, and the average maximum range from the F-layer at 225 km is 2200 NM. 
These ranges will obviously change as the height of the ionized layers changes.
Multi-hop sky wave occurs when the wave is refracted at the ionosphere then the sky wave is 
reflected back from the surface of the earth to the ionosphere etc.  Multi-hop sky wave can 
achieve ranges of half the diameter of the earth.

HF Communications
Over inhabited land areas VHF communications are ideal for all communications between 
aircraft and ground. However, over oceans and uninhabited land areas, long range systems 
are required. Satellite Communications (SatCom) are not yet the norm, so long range 
communication must be provided by surface wave or sky wave propagation.
To achieve ranges of 2000 - 3000 NM using surface wave propagation would require low 
frequencies either from the lower end of LF band or the upper end of VLF band. Communication 
systems utilizing these frequencies would require relatively complex equipment with an 
associated weight penalty. Lower frequencies are also subject to greater static interference 
than higher frequencies, making such systems somewhat tedious to use. Furthermore, data 
rates associated with low frequencies are notoriously low.
Currently, therefore, the only practical solution is HF Communications utilizing sky wave 
propagation. In the future, no doubt, SatCom will become commonplace.
Figure 2.14 
The maximum usable frequency (MUF) for a given range will be that of the first returning sky 
wave and this is the ideal frequency for that range because it will have had the shortest path 
through the ionosphere, and therefore, will have experienced less attenuation and contain less 
static interference.  However, since the ionization intensity fluctuates, a decrease in ionization 
would result in an increase in skip distance and hence loss of signal.  So a compromise frequency is 
used, known as the optimum working frequency (OWF), which by decades of experimentation 
and experience has been determined to be 0.85 times the MUF.
Since ionization levels are lower by night than by day it follows that the frequency required 
for use at a particular range by night will of necessity be less than the frequency required for 
use by day.  A good rule of thumb is that the frequency required at night is roughly half that 
required by day.

Radio Propagation Theory
Because skip distance increases as frequency increases, the range at which communication is 
required will also influence the selection of the frequency to be used.  Short ranges will require 
lower frequencies and longer ranges will require higher frequency.
A typical example of the sort of problem that may appear is:
An aircraft on a flight from London, UK to New York, USA is in mid-Atlantic at sunrise.
The pilot is in communication with the UK on a frequency of 12 MHz.
What frequency can the pilot expect to use with the USA? (See Figure 2.16).
Figure 2.15 HF Communications Mid-Atlantic
Answer:  6 MHz.
The wave will be refracted halfway between the aircraft and the UK, and halfway between 
the aircraft and the USA.  Midway between the aircraft and the UK it is day, so a relatively high 
frequency will be required.  Midway between the aircraft and the USA it is night so a relatively 
low frequency will be required.

Super-refraction
This is a phenomenon which is significant at frequencies above 30 MHz (that is VHF and 
above).  Radio waves experience greater refraction, that is, they are bent downwards towards 
the earth’s surface more than in normal conditions, giving notable increases in line of sight 
range to as much as 40% above the usual.  
The conditions which give rise to super-refraction are:
•	 Decrease in relative humidity with height
•	 Temperature falling more slowly with height than standard
•	 Fine weather and high pressure systems
•	 Warm air flowing over a cooler surface
In extreme cases when there is a low level temperature inversion with a marked decrease in 
humidity with increasing height (simply, warm dry air above cool moist air), a low level duct 
may be formed which traps radio waves at frequencies above 30 MHz giving extremely long 
ranges.  This phenomenon is known as duct propagation and can lead to exceptionally long 
ranges.  When interference is experienced on UK television channels from continental stations, 
the reason for this is the forming of such a duct.
This phenomenon is most common where warm desert areas are bordering oceanic areas, e.g. 
the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas.  It can also occur in temperate latitudes when high 
pressure predominates, particularly in the winter months when the dry descending air in the 
high pressure system is heated by the adiabatic process and is warmer than the underlying cool 
and moist air.
Sub-refraction
Much rarer than super-refraction, but still of significance in radio propagation, sub-refraction 
causes a reduction in the normal refraction giving a decrease in line of sight range by up to 
20%.  
The conditions which give rise to sub-refraction are:
•	 An increase in relative humidity with increasing height
•	 Temperature decreasing with increasing height at a greater rate than standard
•	 Poor weather with low pressure systems
•	 Cold air flowing over a warm surface

Modulation
Introduction
Modulation is the name given to the process of adding information to a radio wave or the 
formatting of radio waves for other purposes.  Of the main forms of modulation, five have 
application in aviation:
Keyed Modulation
Amplitude Modulation (AM)
Frequency Modulation (FM)
Phase Modulation 
Pulse Modulation
The modulation of a radio frequency is generally associated with the transmission of audio 
information, although the transmission of data, including that in satellite navigation systems, 
and the determination of bearing in VOR, for example, require modulation for other purposes.
Before an audio signal can be added to a radio wave it must be converted to an electrical 
signal.  This will be achieved by the use of a microphone, which is quite simply a device that 
converts sound waves to an electrical current.
It will be assumed for AM and FM that this conversion has already been accomplished.
Keyed Modulation
The simplest way to put information onto a carrier wave is to quite simply interrupt the wave 
to give short and long bursts of energy.
Figure 3.1 Morse ‘K’ in keyed modulation
 
●
‘K’ 
By arranging the transmissions into short and long periods of carrier wave transmission we can 
send information using the Morse code.  This is known as telegraphy and until the development 
of other forms of modulation was the only means of passing information.  Keyed modulation 
is still used by some non-directional beacons (NDBs) for identification and will be discussed 
further in Chapter 7.

Modulation
Amplitude Modulation (AM)
In AM the amplitude of the audio frequency (AF) modifies the amplitude of the radio frequency 
(RF).
Figure 3.2 Amplitude modulation
As can be seen from the diagram above, positive amplitude in the AF gives an increase in 
amplitude in the RF and negative amplitude in the AF gives a decrease in amplitude in the RF.
The process of combining a radio frequency with a current at audio frequencies is known as 
heterodyning.  Looking in more detail at the process; the heterodyning process combines the 
two frequencies, leaving the RF unchanged but producing new frequencies at the sum and 
difference of the RF and AF.  For example an audio frequency of 3 kHz is used to amplitude 
modulate a radio frequency of 2182 kHz.  The RF remains unchanged but the AF is now split 
into 2 sidebands extending upwards from 2182.001 kHz to 2185 kHz – the upper sideband 
(USB) and a lower sideband (LSB) extending downwards from 2181.999 kHz to 2179 kHz.  The 
spread of frequencies is from 2179 kHz to 2185 kHz giving a bandwidth of 6 kHz, i.e. double 
the audio frequency used.

As can be seen from the table the power that is in the AF is divided equally between the two 
sidebands, furthermore the information in the AF is contained in both sidebands.  It should 
also be noted that only one third of the signal is carrying the information.
Single Sideband (SSB)
There is redundancy in double sideband transmissions in that the information is contained in 
both the upper and lower sidebands.  Additionally, the original RF carrier wave having served 
its purpose to get the audio information into radio frequencies is now redundant.  So it is 
possible to remove one of the sidebands and the carrier wave because the remaining sideband 
contains all the information.  This is known as single sideband (SSB) operation.

When using sky wave propagation for communication, the differing refraction occurring at 
different frequencies leads to an increase in distortion if the bandwidth is too large.  The 
ionosphere comprises electrically charged particles which cause high levels of static interference 
on radio waves, the use of SSB significantly reduces the effect of this interference.  The MF & 
HF frequencies used for long range communication are in great demand, hence the use of 
SSB transmissions increases the number of channels available.  The use of SSB also reduces the 
amount of power required.  
Thus the main advantages of SSB are:
•	 Double the number of channels available with double sideband
•	 Better signal/noise ratio (less interference)
•	 Less power required hence lighter equipment

Modulation
Frequency Modulation (FM)
In Frequency Modulation, the amplitude of the audio frequency modifies the frequency of the 
carrier wave.
Figure 3.5 Frequency modulation
The change in the carrier wave frequency is dependent on the rise and fall of the amplitude of 
the modulating wave/audio frequency: the greater the amplitude, the greater the frequency 
deviation. The frequency of the modulating wave determines the rate of change of frequency 
within the modulated carrier wave.
When FM is used for sound broadcasting (for example, music radio stations), the bandwidth 
permitted by international agreements is 150 kHz, compared to 9 kHz allowed for AM. In 
general, therefore, FM is unsuitable for use on frequencies below VHF.
For voice communications the bandwidth can be considerably reduced whilst still maintaining 
the integrity of the information; this is known as Narrow Band FM (NBFM). Typically, NBFM 
systems have a bandwidth of 8 kHz, which is greater than the 6 kHz permitted for Aeronautical 
Communications and the 3 kHz used in HF Communications; therefore, NBFM communication 
systems are not yet used in aviation.

Phase Modulation
In phase modulation the phase of the carrier wave is modified by the input signal.  There are 
two cases: the first is where the input is an analogue signal when the phase of the carrier wave 
is modified by the amplitude of the signal;  secondly, with a digital signal it is known as phase 
shift keying, the phase change reflects a 0 or 1; e.g. 0° phase shift indicates a zero and 180° 
phase shift represents a 1.  (Note: this is the simplest case as multiple data can be represented 
by using many degrees of phase shift.)
There are two cases used in navigation systems, MLS and GPS.  GPS uses binary phase shift 
keying, MLS uses differential phase shift keying.

Amplitude Modulation
Pulse Modulation
Pulse modulation is used extensively in radar systems and for data exchange in communications 
systems. An intermittent carrier wave is formed by the generation and transmission of a 
sequence of short period pulses.
Emission Designators
In order to easily identify the characteristics and information provided by electronic signals, 
a list of designators has been devised.  They comprise 3 alphanumerics, where the first letter 
defines the nature of the modulation, the second digit the nature of the signal used for the 
modulation and the third letter the type of information carried.

For example, VHF radio telephony communications have the designation A3E. 
Reference to the table gives the following breakdown:
	
A - Amplitude modulation - Double sideband
	
3 - Single channel containing analogue information
	
E - Telephony, including sound broadcasting
This means an RF carrier wave is being amplitude modulated with speech.
HF radio telephony communications have the designation J3E, this gives:
	
J - Amplitude modulation – single sideband with suppressed carrier
	
3 - Single channel containing analogue information
	
E - Telephony, including sound broadcasting
This means an RF carrier wave is being amplitude modulated with speech then the RF carrier 
wave is being removed along with one of the sidebands.
It is not necessary to know the details of the table.

Introduction
Antennae or aerials are the means by which radio energy is radiated and received.  The type 
of antenna used will be determined by the function the radio system is required to perform. 
This chapter will look at the principles which are common to all antennae and at the specialities 
required for particular radio navigation systems.
Basic Principles
There are two basic types of aerial used for receiving and transmitting basic communications, 
the half-wave dipole and the Marconi or quarter-wave aerial.

Figure 4.1: Half-wave dipole
With the dipole aerial the power is fed to the centre of the aerial and radiates in all directions 
perpendicular to the aerial.  The Marconi aerial is set on, but insulated from, a metal surface 
which acts as the second part of a dipole, with the radio energy radiating perpendicular to the 
aerial.  Because of the better aerodynamic qualities, Marconi aerials are used on aircraft.
λ

Figure 4.2: Marconi aerial
For an aerial to operate with maximum efficiency it must be the correct length for the 
wavelength of the frequency in use.  As the names imply the ideal length for an aerial is half 
or quarter of the wavelength of the frequency being transmitted.  However, whilst we regard 
the speed of propagation of electromagnetic energy as being constant, this is only true in a 
specified medium.  If the energy passes from one medium to another the speed will change.  In 
the case of electromagnetic energy, the denser the medium the slower the speed.  This needs 
to be taken into account in the length of aerials.

Example:
What is the optimum length for a Marconi aerial transmitting on a frequency of 125 MHz?
Recall from Chapter 1:
Wavelength 	
With a wavelength of 2.4 m, the optimum length will be:
Aerial Feeders
The means by which energy is carried between the aerial and transmitter or receiver is 
dependent on the frequency in use and the power levels.  At low and medium frequencies a 
simple wire is adequate to carry the signal over reasonable distances with little energy loss.  As 
frequency increases the power losses increase and into HF and VHF a twin wire feeder is more 
efficient.  At UHF frequencies, the power losses in these simple feeders becomes unacceptably 
high and a coaxial cable is required.
In the upper part of the UHF band and in the SHF and EHF bands the use of dipole or Marconi 
aerials is precluded because of the high energy losses and the way the energy is produced.  At 
these frequencies a waveguide is used to carry the energy to or from the aerial.  The waveguide 
is a hollow, rectangular metal tube.  The internal dimensions of the tube are determined by the 
frequency in use, being half the wavelength.

Polar Diagrams
A polar diagram is used to show the radiation or reception pattern of an aerial.  It is simply a 
line joining all points of equal signal strength and is generally a plan view perpendicular to the 
plane of radiation or reception.  From here on we will talk about radiation only, but the same 
principle applies to reception.
A dipole aerial radiates most energy at right angles to the aerial with signal strength decreasing 
towards the ends of the aerial, where there is no radiation.  A three dimensional representation 
of radiation from such an aerial would be a torus, centred on the centre point of the aerial:
VERTICAL PD
COMPOSITE PD
Figure 4.3 3-D Polar Diagram (PD)
Clearly such diagrams would be cumbersome so a plan view of the plane of radiation is used:
HORIZONTAL PD

Directivity
Many systems require the directional emission or reception of energy, for example; radar, ILS, 
MLS and many more.  How this directivity is achieved depends on the frequency and application.
The simplest way to achieve directivity is to add parasitic elements to the aerial.  If we place a 
metal rod 5% longer than the aerial at a distance of quarter of a wavelength from the aerial 
and in the same plane as the aerial, it will act as a reflector.
Figure 4.5 Directivity using reflector
This reflector re-radiates the energy 180° out of phase, the resulting polar diagram is shown 
above, with no signal behind the reflector and increased signal in front of the aerial.
This process can be taken further by adding other elements in front of the aerial. These elements 
are known as directors and are smaller than the aerial itself.
Figure 4.6 Improved directivity using reflector and directors
All will recognize this as being the type of aerial array used for the reception of television 
signals.  The directors have the effect of focussing the signal into (or out of) the aerial, giving a 
stronger signal than that which would be generated by a simple dipole.
--- Page 65 ---

However, directivity comes with its own price.  As can be seen from the diagram, we have 
produced a strong beam along the plane of the aerial, but have also produced many unwanted 
side lobes which would receive (and transmit) unwanted signals.  Signals received in these side 
lobes produce characteristic ghosting on television pictures, usually caused by reflections from 
buildings etc.  These side lobes give major problems which have to be addressed in SSR and ILS, 
and also produce problems in primary radars.
The Instrument Landing System (ILS) uses an extension of this idea to produce the narrow 
beams (or lobes) of energy required to guide aircraft along the runway centre line: the ILS 
‘localizer’ antenna which produces this is an array of 16 or 24 aerials placed in line with half 
wavelength spacing.  There is some modification to the way the signal is fed to the aerials but 
the end result is that two narrow beams of energy are produced which are symmetrical, close 
to the centre line of the runway as shown in Figure 4.7.
Figure 4.7 ILS localizer lobes.
In the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) a loop aerial is used to detect the direction of an 
incoming signal.

Figure 4.8 Loop aerial ‘Figure-of-eight’ polar diagram
When the loop is aligned with the incoming signal then there is a phase difference between 
the signals in each of the vertical elements of the loop and there will be a net flow of current 
from the loop.  If the loop is placed at right angles to the incoming signal then the induced 
currents will be equal and will cancel each other out giving a zero output.

The resulting polar diagram will have two distinct nulls which can be used to determine the 
direction from which the radio wave is coming.  How this principle is utilized will be discussed 
in detail in Chapter 7.
Radar Aerials
Radar systems operate in the UHF and SHF bands; the transmission of such frequency energy 
requires the use of ‘waveguides’ rather than cables.  The parabolic dish is widely used as a 
‘reflector’: the open end of a waveguide (see Figure 4.9) is positioned at the focal point of 
the parabola (the centre of curvature, designated by point F in Figure 4.10) and directs the 
RF energy towards the dish. The energy from the open waveguide is reflected by the dish 
as parallel rays; the path length FXB, FYA etc. will therefore be equal and the transmitted 
wavefront will be made up of parallel rays that are all in phase.
Figure 4.9 Horn feed to Parabolic Reflector
Figure 4.10 Principles of the Parabolic Reflector
In principle a very narrow pencil beam should be produced as shown below, but apart from 
the region very close to the antenna, the beam, in fact, diverges. In effect, the parabolic 
reflector converts a point source of energy (the open waveguide) at the focal point into a 
plane wavefront of uniform phase.

In addition, due to uneven reflection, some of the energy ‘spills out’ of the reflector to form 
side lobes (shown in Figure 4.11); these contain sufficient energy to produce valid returns 
outside the main lobe or beam.
Figure 4.11 Polar diagram of parabolic reflector
Modern Radar Antennae
Modern radar development has introduced a different type of aerial: the Flat Plate Array, 
Phased Array, or Slotted Antenna (see Figure 4.12). The antenna is a ‘flat plate’ with numerous 
waveguide-size slots cut into it. The individual slots are fed with RF energy from behind the 
plate; the transmitted radar beam is therefore a result of the interaction of the numerous 
individual beams.
This type of antenna is more efficient than the parabolic reflector: it ‘wastes’ much less energy 
in the side lobes and, for a given frequency, the RF energy is concentrated into a narrower 
beam. Since the flat plate array is a more efficient means of transmission, radars incorporating 
this technology require less power.

Introduction
The Doppler principle can be used to determine the relative speed between moving objects by 
measuring the difference between transmitted and received frequencies; for example, police 
forces all over the world use a form of Doppler radar to check vehicle speeds.
A Doppler navigation system uses the Doppler principle to measure an aircraft’s ground speed 
and drift.  The most modern systems combine the inherent accuracy of Doppler measurements 
with information from other navigation systems (for example:  IRS, VOR/DME or GPS) in various 
configurations to suit customer requirements.
Using these additional navigation inputs helps to eradicate the problems associated with early 
Doppler Navigation Systems, such as inaccurate heading references, and degradation (or loss) 
of Doppler inputs when flying over large expanses of water.
The Doppler principle is utilized in many navigation systems, such as Radar, Doppler VOR and 
VDF.
The Doppler Principle
The Austrian physicist, Christian Doppler, predicted the Doppler Effect in connection with 
light waves in the 19th Century, but it also holds true for sound and radio waves:  a received 
frequency will only be the same as the transmitted frequency when there is no relative 
movement between the transmitter and receiver.
A simple analogy would be a visit to the beach.  Standing still in the water, the waves rolling in 
splash you at, for example, four waves per minute.  If you walk into the sea, you are progressively 
reducing the space between each wave and therefore they splash you more frequently than 
four times per minute.  The rate at which the waves are produced has not changed, but you 
perceive that the rate has increased.  The faster you walk into the sea, towards the waves, the 
greater the rate at which they will strike you.
Conversely, if you walk back towards the shore, you are effectively stretching out the distance 
between each wave and therefore the waves will strike you less frequently.
The result is that you (as a receiver) perceive an increase in the frequency of the waves when 
there is relative movement towards the waves (the sea as transmitter), and a decrease in the 
frequency when the relative movement is away from the waves; there has been no actual 
change in the frequency of the waves.
The difference between the frequency you perceive the waves striking you and the actual 
frequency at which they roll in to shore is the ‘Doppler Shift’ or ‘Doppler Frequency’.  That 
difference varies with the speed at which you walk into or out of the sea – the relative motion.
The same effect occurs at radio frequencies:  whenever there is relative motion between a 
transmitter and a receiver, the receiver will perceive a Doppler frequency shift that is proportional 
to their relative motion.

Airborne Doppler
A typical airborne Doppler installation employs a slotted waveguide antenna in which the 
transmitter and receiver elements are screened from each other but share the same aerial.  It 
is arranged that an array of beams is transmitted downwards towards the earth’s surface as 
shown in Figure 5.1.  
The diagram shows a commonly-adopted configuration:  there are four beams, two pointing 
forward and two pointing aft.  This is known as a 4-Beam Janus Array, named after the Roman 
God of Doorways who was reputed to be able to face both ways simultaneously.

Doppler Operation
The Doppler functions by continuous measurement of the frequency shift in the reflected 
signal caused as a result of the aircraft’s motion over the ground.  The equipment converts the 
measured values into the aircraft’s speed along track (ground speed) and speed across track 
(used to determine drift).
The frequency shifts detected in a four-beam Janus array of an aircraft travelling forwards with 
zero drift will be equal (but opposite for fore and aft beams).  In other words, the forward 
beams detect an upward shift in the received frequency and the aft beams detect a downward 
shift in the received frequency from the beams pointing aft; the magnitude of the shift will 
be equal but opposite.  The shift in both sets of beams is proportional to the aircraft’s ground 
speed.
If the aircraft is drifting left or right, then there will be a difference in the frequencies received 
from port and starboard beams.  In a modern, fixed aerial system the differences in frequencies 
are electronically processed to provide a continuous indication of drift and ground speed; the 
information (together with a heading input) can also be provided to a navigation system that 
can determine the aircraft’s position.
In earlier, mechanical systems (using pitch-stabilized, rotating aerials) the difference in frequency 
shifts was converted to an electrical signal that actuated a motor.  The motor then drove the 
aerial until it was aligned with aircraft track, at which stage the port and starboard frequency 
shifts would be equalized.  A pick-off then measured the difference between the aircraft’s fore/
aft axis (representing heading) and the alignment of the port and starboard beams (track); the 
difference being drift.
Doppler Navigation Systems
The Doppler continuously updates the values of aircraft drift and ground speed.  In early 
systems, the aircraft’s departure point was loaded into a navigation computer. The values of 
drift and ground speed, together with an input of aircraft heading, were also fed into the 
computer, which converted them into aircraft position.  The calculated position was then 
displayed as latitude and longitude or as distances (in nautical miles) along and across track.

VHF Direction Finder (VDF)
Introduction
The VHF Direction Finder (VDF) is a means of providing a pilot with the direction to fly towards 
a ground station - a bearing.  The bearing can be used to ‘home’ towards the ground station 
or, in conjunction with another bearing, or bearings, can be used to establish a fix position. 
VDF is rarely used because there are so many more sophisticated and more accurate systems 
available.
Bearings are provided, by voice, on an aircraft’s VHF Communications frequency; they are 
therefore available on 118.0 - 137 MHz (Emission Code A3E).  Auto-triangulation (position 
automatically provided from a number of VDF bearings from different stations) is available, 
but solely on the VHF International Distress Frequency – 121.5 MHz.  At present, UHF DF is 
limited to military use.
The Aeronautical Stations offering a VDF service are listed in the AD Section of the AIP.  Some 
VDF stations stipulate that the service is not available for en route navigation purposes (except 
in emergency).  VDF bearing information will only be given when conditions are satisfactory 
and radio bearings fall within the calibrated limits of the station.  If the provision of a radio 
bearing is not possible the pilot will be told of the reason.
Procedures
A pilot may request a VDF bearing using the appropriate phrase or Q-Code to specify the 
service required (see Figure 6.1):
‘QDM QDM QDM OXFORD APPROACH G-DS REQUEST QDM, G-DS’
Figure 6.1 QDM/QDR/QTE.

A VDF station will provide the following as requested:	
•	 QDR    Aircraft’s Magnetic Bearing from the station (Radial); used for en route navigation
•	 QDM  Aircraft’s Magnetic Heading to steer (assuming no wind) to reach the VDF station;  	
            used mainly for station homing and let-downs using  published procedures
•	 QTE     Aircraft’s True Bearing from the station; used for en route navigation
•	 QUJ     Aircraft’s True Track to the station; not generally used
Note:	 QDM is the reciprocal of QDR; QUJ is the reciprocal of QTE. QDR, QDM and QTE are 
most commonly used.
The direction-finding station will reply in the following manner:
•	 The appropriate phrase or Q code
•	 The bearing or heading in degrees in relation to the direction finding station
•	 The class of bearing
•	 The time of observation, if required
The accuracy of the observation is classified as follows:
•	 Class A – Accurate within ± 2°
•	 Class B – Accurate within ± 5°
•	 Class C – Accurate within ± 10°
•	 Class D – Accuracy less than Class C
Note:	 Normally, bearings no better than Class B will be available. The latest equipment uses 
Doppler principles to determine a high-resolution bearing that can be displayed as a 
digital read-out; bearings produced in this manner have an accuracy of ±0.5° (available 
on UHF and VHF systems).

Principle of Operation
The only equipment required to obtain a VDF bearing is a VHF radio; some specialist equipment 
is required on the ground: a suitable aerial and a display.
A VHF voice communications radio produces a vertically polarized signal; therefore, the ground 
antenna is vertically polarized and has an array of vertical elements arranged in a circle.  See 
Figure 6.2.
Figure 6.2: Obtaining a VDF Bearing
The equipment resolves the bearing from transmissions received at each element within the 
array.  The bearing is then displayed on the display.  The bearing can be displayed relative to 
either True or Magnetic North (at the station).

Range of VDF
•	 As VDF utilizes the VHF Band (or UHF as required) the range will obey the line of sight 
formula:  the higher the transmitters the greater the reception range
	
Line of sight Range (MTR)	
•	 Intervening high ground will limit range, especially for low flying aircraft in hilly 	terrain. 
•	 The power of airborne and ground transmitters will limit ranges.
•	 Gradients of temperature and humidity can give greater than line of sight range.
Factors Affecting Accuracy
•	 Propagation error and site error caused by the aircraft’s transmissions being reflected from 
terrain as they travel to the site, or being reflected from buildings at the site.
•	 Aircraft attitude:  the VDF System and VHF Communications are vertically polarized; 
therefore, best reception and results will be obtained when the aircraft flies straight and 
level.
•	 Poor accuracy is likely in the overhead of a VDF receiver, particularly with the latest  Doppler 
systems.  The reception of both Direct Wave and Ground Reflected Wave can cause signal 
fading or loss; the phenomenon is usually short-lived.  Together with other multi path signals 
this gives rise to bearing errors.
•	 Synchronous transmissions by two or more aircraft will cause momentary errors in bearings.
Determination of Position
If there are sufficient ground stations, linked to an ATCC, the aircraft’s position can be fixed 
using auto-triangulation and the position transmitted to the pilot. This facility may be available 
to Distress and Diversion Cells, but can not be guaranteed.

Automatic Direction Finder (ADF)
Introduction
Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) equipment in the aircraft is used in conjunction with a simple 
low and medium frequency non-directional beacon (NDB) on the ground to provide an aid for 
navigation and for non-precision approaches to airfields. However, it was due to be phased 
out in 2005, but still continues in use. Indeed, many UK aerodromes still have NDB instrument 
approach procedures, and it is the only instrument approach procedure available at some 
aerodromes.
Non-directional Beacon (NDB)
The Non-directional Beacon (NDB) is a ground based transmitter which transmits vertically 
polarized radio signals, in all directions (hence the name), in the Low Frequency (LF) and 
Medium Frequency (MF) bands.
When an aircraft’s Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) is tuned to an NDB’s frequency and its 
call sign identified, the direction of the NDB will be indicated.
A ‘cone of silence’ exists overhead the NDB transmitter during which the aircraft does not 
receive any signals. The diameter of the cone increases with aircraft height.
Principle of Operation
The ADF measures the bearing of an NDB relative to the fore/aft axis of the aircraft.
If a loop aerial is placed in the plane of the transmitted radio frequency a voltage will be 
generated in the vertical elements of the loop because of the phase difference of the wave in 
each of the vertical elements.  As the loop is rotated the voltage induced will decrease until 
it becomes zero when the loop is perpendicular to the radio wave.  As the loop continues to 
rotate a voltage will be induced in the opposite sense etc.

The polar diagram formed is a figure of eight as shown below (Figure 7.2).  It can be seen that 
there are two null positions and that by rotating the loop until a null is reached the direction of 
the beacon can be determined.  This is fine if the approximate direction of the beacon is known, 
but if that is not the case then there are two possible choices. Furthermore, if equipment is to 
automatically determine position, then with only the single loop  it  would have an insoluble 
problem.
Figure 7.2 Polar diagrams of loop & dipole aerials

To resolve this ambiguity a simple dipole aerial, called a sense aerial, is added. The polar 
diagram of the sense aerial is circular.  The currents generated are combined electronically as if 
the sense aerial was in the middle of the loop aerial (Figure 7.3).  The relative signal strengths 
of the two signals are shown.
Figure 7.3

Automatic Direction Finder (ADF)
It is arranged for the field from the sense aerial to be in phase with one element (the left 
hand element shown in diagram) of the loop aerial (Figure 7.4).  The resultant polar diagram 
is known as a CARDIOID.  The cardioid has a single null which as can be seen is ill-defined and 
would not in itself provide an accurate bearing.  However, the correct null in the loop aerial 
can be defined by introducing a logic circuit which defines the correct null as being that null, in 
the loop aerial which, when the loop aerial is rotated clockwise, produces an increase in signal 
strength in the cardioid.
Figure 7.4 
The resultant null with a single cardioid is not precise enough to meet the ICAO accuracy 
requirement of +/-5°. To improve the accuracy to meet the requirements, the polarity of the 
sense aerial is reversed to produce a right hand cardioid. Then by rapidly switching (about 120 
Hz) between the two cardioids, the null is more precisely defined and hence the accuracy is 
improved.

In reality it is not feasible to have a rotating loop outside the aircraft, so the loop is fixed 
and has four elements, two aligned with the fore-aft axis of the aircraft with the other two 
perpendicular to the fore-aft axis.  The electrical fields are transmitted to a similar four elements 
in a goniometer reproducing the electro magnetic field detected by the aerial.  The signal from 
the sense aerial is also fed to the goniometer where a search coil detects the unambiguous 
direction. The principle employed within the goniometer is as described above.
Figure 7.6 Fixed Loop ADF
Frequencies and Types of NDB
The allocated frequencies for NDBs are 190 - 1750 kHz in the LF and MF bands.  Since the mode 
of propagation used is surface wave, most NDBs will be found between about 250 and 450 
kHz.  There are two types of NDB in current use:
Locator (L).  These are low powered NDBs used for airfield or runway approach procedures 
or are co-located with, and supplement, the outer and middle markers of an ILS system. They 
normally have  ranges of 10 to 25 NM and may only be available during an aerodrome’s 
published hours of operation.
En route NDBs. These have a range of 50 NM or more, and where serving oceanic areas may 
have ranges of several hundred miles.  They are used for homing, holding, en route and airways 
navigation.

Figure 7.7 Two ADF Receivers
Emission Characteristics and Beat Frequency Oscillator (BFO)
The NDBs have a 2 or 3 letter identification and there are two types of emission:
N0NA1A          N0NA2A
The N0N part of the emission is the transmission of an unmodulated carrier wave, which 
would not be detectable on a normal receiver, so a BFO is provided on ADF equipment. When 
selected, the BFO produces an offset frequency within the receiver which when combined with 
the received frequency produces a tone of say 400 or 1020 Hz.
The A1A part is the emission of an interrupted unmodulated carrier wave which requires the 
BFO to be on for aural reception.  A2A is the emission of an amplitude modulated signal which 
can be heard on a normal receiver.
Hence, when using N0NA1A beacons, the BFO should be selected ON for (manual) tuning, 
identification and monitoring.  N0NA2A beacons require the BFO ON for (manual) tuning but 
OFF for identification and monitoring.  (The BFO may be labelled TONE or TONE/VOICE on 
some equipments).

Presentation of Information
The information may be presented on a relative bearing indicator (RBI) or a radio magnetic 
indicator (RMI).  In either case the information being presented is relative bearing.
The RBI has a standard compass rose where 360° is aligned with the fore-aft axis of the aircraft, 
although with some RBIs it is possible to manually set heading to directly read the magnetic 
bearing.  In the diagram the aircraft is heading 300°(M), the RBI is showing a relative bearing of 
136°, thus the magnetic bearing is 300° + 136° - 360° = 076°.  The information from the ADF to 
the RMI is still relative, but the RMI compass card is fed with magnetic heading, so the bearing 
shown is the magnetic bearing of the NDB.
The needle always points to the beacon (QDM) and the tail of the needle gives the QDR.

Uses of the Non-directional Beacon
•	 En route navigational bearings.
•	 Homing to or flying from the NDB when maintaining airway centre lines.
•	 Holding overhead at an assigned level in a race-track pattern.
•	 Runway instrument approach procedures.
Plotting ADF Bearings
The plotting of ADF bearings is dealt with in depth in the Navigation General syllabus.  At 
this stage it is sufficient to remind the reader that the bearing is measured at the aircraft so 
variation to convert to a true bearing must be applied at the aircraft.  Account will also need to 
be taken of the convergency between the aircraft and beacon meridians.
Track Maintenance Using the RBI
An aircraft is required to maintain track(s):
•	 When flying airway centre line between NDBs.
•	 When holding over an NDB or Locator.
•	 When carrying  out a let-down procedure at an airfield based solely upon NDB(s)/Locator(s) 
or NDB(s)/Locators combined with other navaids.
•	 When requested by ATC to intercept and maintain a track or airway centre line.
•	 When carrying out interceptions.
Homing
Figure 7.10 shows an aircraft maintaining 360° relative bearing, in zero wind (zero drift). The 
aircraft is heading 077° and therefore will track inbound on 077°.

Figure 7.11 shows an aircraft maintaining a relative bearing of 360°, with a crosswind from the 
left. As a result a curved track will be followed.
Figure 7.11 Homing Making no Allowance for Drift
Tracking Inbound
To achieve a required track inbound to an NDB, with a crosswind, the correct method is to allow 
for the anticipated drift therefore maintaining a constant track.  In Figure 7.12, 20° Starboard 
drift is anticipated, so 20 is Subtracted from track. The aircraft is heading 060° with a relative 
bearing of 020°.
Figure 7.12 
In Figure 7.13, 28° Port drift is anticipated, so this is added (Plus) to the track value. The aircraft 
is heading 108° with a relative bearing of 332°.

Tracking Outbound
Figure 7.14 shows an aircraft maintaining the required track outbound from an NDB in zero 
wind (zero drift) conditions.  The aircraft is heading 260° and has a relative bearing of 180°.
Figure 7.14 
Figure 7.15 shows an aircraft maintaining a track of 100° in crosswind conditions where the drift 
is known. 23° of Starboard drift is anticipated, this is Subtracted from the track, therefore the 
heading is 077° with a relative bearing of 203° from the NDB.
Figure 7.15 
In Figure 7.16  20° Port drift is anticipated, this is added (Plus) to track giving an aircraft heading 
of 110° with a relative bearing of 160°.

Drift Assessment and Regaining Inbound Track
Figure 7.17 Assessing Drift Inbound
Initially, fly the aircraft on the required track with the beacon dead ahead (000° rel.).
Maintain the aircraft heading and watch the relative bearing indicator. If the relative bearing 
increases the aircraft is experiencing port drift.
Alter heading, say 30° starboard, to regain track. The relative bearing will become 330° when 
track is regained.
Assume a likely drift (say 10° port) and calculate a new heading to maintain track. When this 
heading has been taken up, the relative bearing will become 350°.
If the drift has been correctly assessed this relative bearing will be maintained until overhead 
the NDB. If the relative bearing changes however, further heading alterations and a new 
assessment of drift will be necessary.

Drift Assessment and Outbound Track Maintenance
Figure 7.18 Drift Assessing Outbound
In Figure 7.18 it can be seen that with zero drift the RBI indicates 180° relative. With 10° 
starboard drift, the relative bearing increases to 190°, and with 10° port drift the relative 
bearing decreases to 170°. To assess drift by this means the aircraft must maintain a steady 
heading from directly overhead the beacon.
When the drift has been assessed, alter heading port or starboard, by say 30°, to regain track, 
until the correct relative bearing of 210° or 150° is obtained. The aircraft is now back on track. 
The heading must now be altered to take into account the original assessment of drift.

Holding
When density of traffic or bad weather delay an aircraft’s landing at an airport, the air traffic 
controller directs it to a Holding Area. The area, also known as a ‘stack’, is organized over a 
‘radio’ beacon where each waiting aircraft flies a special circuit separated vertically from other 
aircraft by a minimum of 1000 ft. An aircraft drops to the next level as soon as it is free of other 
traffic, until it finally flies from the stack and comes in to land.

Runway Instrument Approach Procedures
Most aerodromes have NDB runway instrument approach procedures.  The pilot flies the 
published procedure in order to position the aircraft in poor weather conditions for a visual 
landing.  The NDB may also be used in conjunction with other runway approach aids for the 
same purpose.

Factors Affecting ADF Accuracy
Designated Operational Coverage (DOC)
The DOC of NDBs  is based upon a daytime protection ratio (signal/noise ratio of 3:1) between 
wanted and unwanted signals that permits the required level of bearing accuracy.  At ranges 
greater than those promulgated, bearing errors will increase.  Adverse propagation conditions 
particularly at night will also increase bearing errors.
Static Interference
There are two types of static interference that can affect the performance of ADF:
Precipitation static is generated by the collision of water droplets and ice crystals with the 
aircraft. It causes a reduction in the signal/noise ratio which affects the accuracy of the bearings 
and can, in extreme circumstances completely mask the incoming signal.  The indications on 
the RMI/RBI will be a wandering needle and the audio will have a background hiss, which is 
also likely to be present on VHF frequencies.
Thunderstorms have very powerful discharges of static electricity across the  electromagnetic 
spectrum including LF and MF.  These discharges cause bearing errors in the ADF.  A static 
discharge in a cumulonimbus cloud (Cb) will be heard as a loud crackle on the audio and the 
needle will move rapidly to point to the Cb. When there are several active cells close together, 
it is possible for the needle to point to them for prolonged periods.  Care must be taken in 
the use of ADF when Cb activity is forecast.  It has been said that during Cb activity the only 
sensible use of the ADF is to indicate where the active cells are.
Night Effect
By day the D-region absorbs signals in the LF and MF bands. At night the D-region disappears 
allowing sky wave contamination of the surface wave being used. This arises for two reasons: 
phase interference of the sky wave with the surface wave because of the different paths and 
the induction of currents in the horizontal elements of the loop aerial.  The effect is reduced 
by the aerial design having very short vertical elements and by screening the aerial above and 
below, but the contamination is not eliminated.  The effect first becomes significant at 70 - 
100 NM from the NDB.  The effect is manifest by fading of the audio signal and the needle 
‘hunting’ and is worst around dawn and dusk, when the ionosphere is in transition.
If ADF is to be used at night:
•	 Positively identify the NDB call sign.
•	 Continue to check the tuning and the identification.
•	 Avoid use of the equipment within 1 hour of sunrise or sunset.
•	 Use NDBs within their promulgated range which is valid during daytime only.
•	 Treat bearings with caution if the needle wanders and the signal fades.
•	 Cross-check NDB bearing information against other navigation aids.

Station Interference
Due to congestion of stations in the LF and MF bands, the possibility of interference from 
stations on or near the same frequency exists. This will cause bearing errors.  By day, the use 
of an NDB within the DOC will normally afford protection from interference. However, at 
night, one can expect interference even within the DOC because of sky wave contamination 
from  stations out of range by day. Therefore positive identification of the NDB at night should 
always be carried out.
Mountain Effect
Mountainous areas can cause reflections and diffraction of the transmitted radio waves to 
produce errors in ADF systems. These errors will increase at low altitude and can be minimized 
by flying higher.
Coastal Refraction
Radio waves speed up over water due to the reduced absorption of energy (attenuation) 
compared to that which occurs over land. This speeding up causes the wave front to bend 
(refract) away from its normal path and pull it towards the coast. Refraction is negligible at  90° 
to the coast but increases as the angle of incidence increases.
Figure 7.22 Coastal refraction
For an aircraft flying over the sea the error puts the aircraft position closer to the coast than its 
actual position.
The effect can be minimised by:
•	 Using NDBs on or near to the coast.
•	 Flying higher.
•	 Using signals that cross the coast at or near to 90°

Automatic Direction Finder (ADF)
Quadrantal Error
The theoretical reception polar diagram of the loop aerial is distorted by the airframe which 
produces a strong electrical field aligned fore and aft.  Incoming NDB signals are thus refracted 
towards the fore and aft airframe axis.  The maximum refraction occurs in the quadrants (i.e. 
on relative bearings of 045°, 135°, 225° & 315°.)  Older ADF systems are regularly ‘swung’ 
to assess the value of quadrantal error.  In modern aircraft the error is determined by the 
manufacturer and corrections are put into the equipment to reduce the effect to a minimum.
Angle of Bank (dip)
A loop aerial is designed to use vertically polarized waves for direction finding. If the incoming 
wave has any horizontal component of polarization it will induce currents in the top and 
bottom horizontal members of the loop resulting in a circulating current. This would destroy 
the nulls of polar diagram (similar to night effect) and reduce the accuracy of the bearings. 
The angle of bank during a turn causes currents to be induced in the horizontal elements of 
the loop thereby leading to a bearing error which is referred to as dip error.  This error is only 
present when the aircraft is not in level flight.
Lack of Failure Warning System
False indications due to a failure in the system are not readily detectable because of the 
absence of failure warning on most ADF instruments.  Particular care should therefore be 
exercised in identifying and monitoring the NDB and independent cross-checks made with 
other navigational aids where possible.  It is essential that when using the ADF as the primary 
navigation aid, for example for a runway approach procedure, that it is continuously monitored 
to detect any failure.
Factors Affecting ADF Range
The major factors which affect the range of NDB/ADF equipment are listed below:
NDB transmission power; the range is proportional to the square root of the power output i.e. 
to double the NDB range, quadruple the power output of the transmitter.
NDB range is greater over water:
	
	
Note: Using ranges calculated by these formulae does not guarantee that the aircraft will be 
within the DOC.
The lower the frequency, the greater the surface wave (greater diffraction, lower attenuation).
All precipitation, including falling snow, reduces the effective range and accuracy of ADF 
bearings.
N0NA1A NDBs have greater ranges than N0NA2A.  But note that ICAO Annex 10 recommends 
the use of N0NA2A for long range beacons.

VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR) 
Introduction
The VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR) was adopted as the standard short range navigation 
aid in 1960 by ICAO. It produces bearing information usually aligned with magnetic north at 
the VOR location.  It is practically free from static interference and is not affected by sky waves, 
which enables it to be used day and night.  When the VOR frequency is paired with a co-located 
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) an instantaneous range and bearing (Rho-Theta) fix is 
obtained. The equipment operates within the frequency range of 108 - 117.95 MHz.
VOR has the following uses:
•	 Marking the beginning, the end and centre line of airways or sections of airways.
•	 As a let-down aid at airfields using published procedures.
•	 As a holding point for aircraft.
•	 As a source of en route navigational position lines.

The Principle of Operation
VOR bearing is obtained by phase comparison:
•	 An aircraft’s VOR receiver measures the phase difference (angular difference) between two 
signals from the VOR transmitter:
◦◦
a 30 Hz frequency modulated omni-directional, reference signal which produces 
constant phase regardless of a receiver's bearing from the VOR, and
◦◦
a 30 Hz amplitude modulated variable phase (directional) signal created by the 
rotating transmission pattern (limaçon).
•	 The 30 Hz FM reference signal is synchronized with the 30 revs/sec rotating directional AM 
signal (limaçon) such that:
◦◦
the two 30 Hz modulations are in phase to an aircraft’s VOR receiver when it is due 
magnetic north of the VOR beacon, and
◦◦
the phase difference measured at any other point will equate to the aircraft’s magnetic 
bearing from the VOR.
The two 30 Hz signals are modulated differently to prevent interaction and merging at 
the aircraft’s receiver.  The rotating limaçon polar diagram, which provides the directional 
information, is created by combining the polar diagrams of the rotating loop and reference 
signal. In early VORs the loop rotation was mechanical; modern VORs use electronic circuitry.

Figure 8.3. shows one revolution of a limaçon with phase differences corresponding  to four 
cardinal points.  The blue sine wave is the reference signal.  Hence, for example:
•	 A phase diff. of 227° measured at the aircraft = 227° Radial.
•	 A phase diff. of 314° measured at the aircraft = 314° Radial.
Thus a VOR beacon transmits bearing information continuously.  This information is supplied 
even during the identification period.
Terminology
A Radial (QDR) is a magnetic bearing FROM a VOR beacon.

Transmission Details
VOR beacons operate within the VHF band (30-300 MHz) between 108.0 - 117.95 MHz as 
follows:
•	 40 channels, 108-112 MHz:
This is primarily an ILS band but ICAO has allowed it to be shared with short range VORs 
and Terminal VORs (TVOR): 108.0, 108.05, 108.20, 108.25, 108.40, 108.45 ….. 111.85 MHz 
(even decimals and even decimals plus 0.05 MHz)
•	 120 channels, 112 - 117.95 MHz (a channel every 0.05 MHz):
The emission characteristics are A9W:
A = main carrier amplitude modulated double side-band.
9 = composite system.
W = combination of telemetry, (telephony) and telegraphy.
Identification
UK VORs use 3 letter aural Morse sent at approximately 7 groups/minute, at least every 10 
seconds. The ‘ident’ may also be in voice form e.g. “This is Miami Omni etc” immediately 
followed by the Morse ident. The voice channel is used to pass airfield information via ATIS. 
This information uses AM (amplitude modulation) and is transmitted at the same time as the 
bearing information. A continuous tone or a series of dots identifies a TEST VOR (VOT).
Monitoring
All VOR beacons are monitored by an automatic site monitor.  The monitor will warn the 
control point and remove either the identification and the navigational signals or switch off 
the beacon in the event of the following:
•	 Bearing information change exceeding 1°.
•	 A reduction of >15% in signal strength, of both or either of the 30 Hz modulations, or of the 
RF carrier frequency.
•	 A failure of the monitor.
When the main transmitter is switched off the standby transmitter is brought on-line and 
takes time to stabilise.  During this period the bearing information can be incorrect and no 
identification is transmitted until the changeover is completed.
Hence, do not use the facility when no identification is heard.  It is vital to monitor a terminal 
VOR let down into an airfield.  If a VOR is transmitting the identification TST it indicates that 
the VOR is on test and the bearing information should not be used.

Types of VOR
CVOR	 	
Conventional VOR is used to define airways and for en-route navigation.
BVOR	 	
A broadcast VOR which gives weather and airfield information between beacon 
identification.
DVOR	 	
A Doppler VOR - this overcomes siting errors.
TVOR	 	
Terminal VOR which has only low power; and is used at major airfields.
VOT	
	
This is found at certain airfields and broadcasts a fixed omni-directional signal 
for a 360° test radial. This is not for navigation use but is used to test an aircraft’s 
equipment accuracy before IFR flight.  More than +/-4° indicates that equipment 
needs servicing.

Combination.   
The Factors Affecting Operational Range of VOR
The higher the transmitter power, the greater the range.  Thus en route VORs with a 200 watt 
transmitter will have about a 200 NM range, and a TVOR will normally transmit at 50 watts.
The transmitter and receiver height will also have an effect on the operational range of VOR as 
the transmissions give line of sight ranges, plus a slight increase due to atmospheric refraction. 
This can be assessed by using the formula:
Maximum theoretical reception range (NM) = 1.23 × (√h1 +  √h2)
where:		
h1 = Receiver height in feet AMSL, and
	
	
h2 = Transmitter height in feet AMSL.
Uneven terrain, intervening high ground, mountains, man-made structures etc., cause VOR 
bearings to be stopped (screened), reflected, or bent (scalloping), all of which give rise to 
bearing errors.
Where such bearing errors are known, AIPS will publish details: e.g. “Errors up to 5.5° may be 
experienced in sector 315° - 345° to 40 NM”.
Designated Operational Coverage - (DOC)
To guarantee no co-frequency interference between the 160 frequencies available worldwide, 
it would be necessary to separate co-frequency beacons by at least twice their anticipated line 
of sight range, e.g. an aircraft at a height of 25 000 ft and the VOR situated at MSL.

VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR) 
Transmitter power, propagation paths and the degree of  co-frequency interference protection 
required, necessitate co-frequency beacons to be separated for planning purposes by an extra 
100 NM to about 500 NM. In practice, a beacon is protected as far as is deemed necessary and 
this is not always the anticipated line of sight reception range.
In the UK this protection is denoted by a DOC, specified as a range and altitude, e.g a DOC of 
50/25 published in AIPs means that an aircraft should not experience co-frequency interference 
within 50 NM of a VOR beacon, up to a height of 25 000 ft.  The DOC may also vary by sectors 
and it is valid day and night.  Use of a VOR outside its DOC can lead to navigation errors.  Refer 
to the latest AIC.
Note:  When super-refraction conditions exist interference may be experienced within the DOC.
Figure 8.7 Designated Operational Coverage.
VOR 1: DOC 50/25 = No interference within 50 NM range up to 25 000 ft.
VOR 2: DOC 100/50 = No interference within 100 NM range up to 50 000 ft.
Factors Affecting VOR Beacon Accuracy
Site error is caused by uneven terrain such as hills and man-made structures, trees and even 
long grass, in the vicinity of the transmitter.  The error to radiated bearings is termed ‘VOR 
course-displacement error’.  Ground VOR beacon site error is monitored to ± 1° accuracy.
Propagation error is caused by the fact that, having left the VOR site with ±1° accuracy, the 
transmissions are further affected by terrain and distance.  At considerable range from the VOR, 
‘bends’ or ‘scalloping’ can occur. VOR scalloping is defined as an imperfection or deviation in 
the received VOR signal.  It causes the signal to 'bend' as a result of reflections from buildings 
or terrain; it causes the Course Deviation Indicator to slowly or rapidly shift from side to side.
Airborne equipment errors are caused by aircraft equipment assessing and converting the 
phase differences to 1° of bearing; maximum aircraft equipment error should be ± 3°.
The above errors are aggregated to give a total error of  ± 5°.  In addition there is pilotage 
error due to the fact that as an aircraft approaches  the VOR the 1° radials get closer together.

The Cone of Ambiguity
As the VOR is approached, the radials converge and the VOR needle becomes more sensitive. 
Near the VOR overhead the needle oscillates rapidly and the ‘OFF’ flag may appear momentarily; 
also the ‘TO/FROM’ display alternates. This is all caused by the cone where there is no planned 
radiation. This is known as the cone of ambiguity or confusion. Once the aircraft has flown 
through this cone the readings at the aircraft will stabilize.
Coverage  
The VOR shall provide signals to permit satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation 
at the levels and distances required for operational reasons, and up to a minimum elevation 
angle of 40°.  In practice, modern VOR beacons are capable of providing usable signals within 
60° to 80° above the horizon.
Figure 8.8 The Cone of Confusion
Doppler VOR (DVOR)
Doppler VORs are second generation VORs.  Although their transmission frequencies are the 
same, the transmitted bearing accuracy is improved as the transmissions are less sensitive to 
site error.
The transmission differences are:
•	 The reference signal is AM.
•	 The variable phase directional signal is FM.

VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR) 
•	 To maintain the phase relationships which exist in conventional VOR transmissions, the 
(apparent or simulated) rotation of the directional signal is anti-clockwise. As a result the 
same airborne VOR equipment can be used with either CVOR or DVOR beacons.
VOR Airborne Equipment
There are 3 main components of the VOR equipment in the aircraft, namely:
•	 Aerial. For slower aircraft the aerial is a whip type fitted on the fuselage and for high speed 
aircraft it is a blade type or is flush mounted on either side of the vertical fin.
•	 Receiver. This is a box fitted in the avionics bay.
•	 Indicator.  Information derived from the VOR signal received at the aircraft may be fed to 
a flight director system or to the more simple displays such as the CDI (course deviation 
indicator) or the RMI (radio magnetic indicator). These are described below.
VOR Deviation Indicator
This instrument displays VOR information, and is widely used in light aircraft. The instrument 
indicates the displacement of the aircraft with respect to a bearing (to or from the VOR station) 
which has been selected on the Course Selector Knob or OBS (Omni-bearing Selector). See 
Figure 8.9.

Figure 8.9 VOR/ILS Deviation Indicator
The indicator drawn in Figure 8.10 is typical with the azimuth scale having a circle and four dots 
on each side of the centre. As the circle itself counts as the first dot this is a five dot display with 
each dot indicating approximately a 2° displacement from the selected VOR bearing. Full scale 
deflection therefore represents 10°. 
This displacement (or deviation) is presented by a deviation bar on the indicator. Figure 8.10 
shows that the displacement of the bar depends on the angular position of the beacon relative 
to the selected bearing and is independent of the way the aircraft is pointing. In other words, 
for a given position and bearing selection, the heading of the aircraft does not affect the 
display on a deviation indicator.

If the aircraft lay exactly on the selected bearing either to or from the station, the deviation

Figure 8.10 Left/Right Indications
Aircraft at positions 2 and 4 both receive a Fly Left indication (deviation bar to the left of 
centre) but note that the aircraft at position 4 must turn to the right to reduce its displacement 
from the selected line.  The deviation bar ‘sense’ is wrong for the aircraft at position 4, and this 
is generally undesirable.  To keep the deviation bar sense correct when flying a track to or from 
a VOR station, the aircraft’s heading should be about the same as the track selected on the 
Omni-bearing Selector (plus or minus any drift allowance).
As the equipment normally includes an automatic To/From flag the rule to be followed to keep 
the deviation bar sense correct is that:
When inbound to a VOR, select the inbound track on the OBS, so that a ‘TO’ indication 
appears. When outbound from a VOR, select the outbound track on the OBS so that a ‘FROM’ 
indication is seen.

VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR) 
In addition to the Left/Right display, the deviation indicator shows a ‘TO’ or a ‘FROM’ flag 
depending on whether:
•	 The aircraft’s QDM is within about 80° of the bearing selected, in which case ‘TO’ appears
•	 The aircraft’s QDR is within about 80° of the bearing selected, in which case ‘FROM’ appears
This leaves two sectors about 20° wide in which an indeterminate TO/FROM indication is 
obtained.
Figure 8.11 To/From Indications
Figure 8.11 depicts the deviation indicator in the various sectors about the VOR beacon.  It 
should be remembered that the six indications in Figure 8.11 are completely independent of 
the aircraft’s heading.  They depend on the aircraft’s bearing from the beacon and on the 
bearing which has been selected on the OBS.
If the VOR transmissions are faulty or the aircraft is out of range or the airborne power supply 
is inadequate, an ‘OFF’ flag appears.

VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR)
There are a few other aspects of deviation indicators which are worth mentioning.  Firstly, 
if the instrument has an ILS glide path needle, this needle will be inoperative, centralized, 
and flagged ‘OFF’ when the indicator is being used to display VOR information.  Conversely, 
when ILS information is being displayed, the OBS is inoperative and the TO/FROM indication 
is meaningless.
Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI)
The RMI provides an alternative means of presenting VOR bearing information and it has been 
described at some length in the ADF notes.  Briefly, it has a remote-reading compass repeater 
card which indicates the aircraft’s magnetic heading against a fixed heading index at the top 
of the instrument.
A pointer indicates on the compass card the aircraft’s QDM to the beacon.  (Two needles 
are common so that two bearings can be simultaneously displayed). Students for professional 
licences should note that before display on the RMI, VOR information must be processed 
differently from ADF information.  This is because the aircraft receives a magnetic bearing 
from the VOR ‘dispensed’ in the form of a phase difference, whereas the ADF equipment gives 
a direct indication of relative bearing.
The VOR QDM derived from the measured phase difference between the reference and vari- 
phase signals is converted to a relative bearing for display on the RMI.  (This is achieved by 
means of a ‘differential synchro’ which automatically subtracts the aircraft’s magnetic heading 
from the VOR QDM).  The resulting relative bearing positions the RMI needle, the point of 
which, however, indicates the original QDM to the VOR because the magnetic heading which 
was subtracted is in effect re-applied by the compass repeater card.  If the QDM to the VOR 
shown on the RMI is to be converted to a True bearing for plotting, the variation at the VOR 
station must be applied.
As an example of the above, and with reference to Figure 8.12, suppose the aircraft heading 
is 040°(M) and the measured phase difference is 270°. The equipment derives from the latter 
a QDM of 090° and subtracts the heading of 040° to give a relative bearing of 050° which 
positions the RMI needle 50° clockwise from the heading index. (If there were a difference in 
variation between the positions of the aircraft and VOR station, this derived relative bearing 
would have a corresponding error but the QDM indicated by the needle would still be correct). 
Continuing with the example, the RMI heading index reads 040° and the needle indicates 040° 
+ 050° = 090°, which is the correct QDM to the VOR based on the magnetic meridian at the 
beacon.  Compare this with the case of an ADF bearing displayed by RMI, where the magnetic 
bearing indicated is based on the magnetic variation at the aircraft.
One useful aspect of RMI presentation deserves mention.  The arrowhead of the needle shows 
the QDM of the beacon, so consequently the ‘tail’ end of this full-diameter pointer indicates 
the reciprocal of the QDM, that is, the radial on which the aircraft is positioned.  Thus both the 
bearing TO and the bearing FROM the station are clearly displayed.
It is worthwhile making a comparison between the RMI and the OBS type deviation indicator. 
The RMI has certain disadvantages in that it is a more complex instrument requiring additional 
hardware, including a remote-reading magnetic compass and the appropriate power supplies. 
It is therefore heavier, occupies more space and is more costly.

In large aircraft these disadvantages are outweighed by the following advantages:
•	 The RMI provides continuous indication of the QDM to a VOR (and the reciprocal of the 
QDM, the radial, at the tail of the pointer).
•	 Magnetic heading is also displayed, on the same instrument; a considerable asset when 
homing to a VOR or maintaining a track outbound.
•	 The approximate relative bearing of a beacon is immediately apparent, a ‘plan view’ of 
the local navigation situation being presented; this is most useful when flying a holding 
procedure.
•	 As the pointer automatically gives a continuous indication of the VOR bearing, the rate of 
crossing radials during interception of a radial is easily assessed.
•	 With two-needle RMIs, the bearings of two beacons can be simultaneously displayed which 
is particularly useful when flying along an airway using one beacon ahead (or astern) for 
track-keeping, and a second beacon off the airway for reporting abeam.
•	 ADF bearings can be displayed on an RMI.

VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR) 
In-flight Procedures
Typical uses of VOR by an aircraft equipped with both CDI-type deviation indicator and an RMI 
are illustrated in Figure 8.23.
Radial Interceptions
In Figure 8.23 the aircraft is shown intercepting the 280° radial by flying a heading of about 
045°(M), commencing the turn shortly before making good the radial so as not to over-shoot 
it.
A heading of 090°(M) is selected to allow for starboard drift inbound.  So the turn is through 
45° taking about 15 seconds. Arrival at the 277 radial should be announced by the Left/Right 
indicator showing about 1.5 dots ‘fly left’ and the RMI needle pointing a QDM of 097° at which 
point he would turn onto 090°(M).
Inbound Track-keeping
Having intercepted the inbound radial, the pilot maintains his heading (of 090°(M) in the Figure 
8.23 example) and watches the Left/Right needle.  Suppose the needle shows a progressively 
increasing displacement left; then the aircraft is moving to the right of the desired inbound 
track. The drift allowance is insufficient and a heading of 085° would perhaps be more suitable. 
The pilot would probably alter heading 30° port on to 060°(M) until the needle centred, 
indicating the aircraft to be back on track, before trying the new heading of 085°(M) and 
again watching the needle.

Further alterations of heading may be necessary before the aircraft is settled down on a 
good inbound heading with the needle reasonably steady in the central position. It is worth 
visualizing how the RMI would behave during the homing just described.
After the interception, the heading of 090° would show against the heading index, the RMI 
needle indicating 100° (the required QDM to the VOR).
Station Passage
Overhead a VOR there is a ‘cone (or zone) of confusion’ with a vertical angle of about 60° to 
80° (ICAO minimum is 40°).  This leads to indeterminate indications over the beacon which at 
high level extend over a considerable area, for instance out to about 4 NM radius at 30 000 ft.
On the VOR/ILS indicator, the needle swings  between hard left and hard right, the OFF flag 
may appear temporarily, and the TO/FROM indicator changes to FROM.  The RMI needle 
fluctuates and then rotates through 180° to indicate the QDM back to the beacon. At low 
altitude these station passage indications are rapid; at high altitude they are slow.
Outbound Flight
The aircraft is shown outbound on the 150 radial on the right-hand side of Figure 8.23. The 
indications are ideal, the TO/FROM flag showing ‘FROM’, and the centralized L/R needle 
showing the aircraft to be on the selected track of 150°.  The information on the deviation 
indicator is confirmed by the RMI needle showing a QDM of 330 back to the beacon.
If these indications were to change, showing a track error developing, the pilot would normally 
make a firm heading alteration (typically 30°) to regain track before steering a revised outbound 
heading appropriate to his revised assessment of drift.

Instrument Landing System (ILS)
Introduction
The Instrument Landing System (ILS) has been in existence for over 40 years and is still the 
most accurate approach and landing aid in current use. The system provides pilots with an 
accurate means of carrying out an instrument approach to a runway, giving guidance both in 
the horizontal and the vertical planes. It even enables aircraft to carry out automatic landings. 
ILS is a precision approach system because it gives guidance in both the horizontal and the 
vertical plane.
ILS provides the pilot with visual instructions in the cockpit to enable him to fly the aircraft down 
a predetermined glide path and extended runway centre line (localizer) to his Decision Height 
(DH).  At decision height the pilot decides to land (if he has the required visual references and 
sufficient room to manoeuvre the aircraft for a safe touchdown) or he goes around (overshoots) 
and carries out the published missed approach procedure.
Figure 9.1 The Instrument Landing System (ILS)
ILS Components
The system requires a suitable ground installation and airborne equipment. The ground 
installation has three distinct components as shown in Figure 9.1, namely localizer, glide path 
and marker beacons; in some installations a back course may also be available.
The localizer (LLZ) transmits in the VHF band and is located about 300 m from the up-wind end 
of the runway.
--- Page 154 ---
Instrument Landing System (ILS)

Instrument Landing System (ILS)
The glide path (GP) transmitter operates in the UHF band, and is frequency paired with the 
localizer. It is located 300 m in from the threshold and about 200 m from the runway edge 
abeam the touchdown point.
Marker beacons transmit at 75 MHz in the VHF band. These include the outer marker (OM), 
the middle marker (MM) and possibly an inner marker (IM). They are provided to enable the 
pilot to cross-check the aircraft’s height against ranges and timing to the runway threshold.
Back course approaches are allowed in some countries. This enables aircraft to make a non-
precision approach on the back beam of the localizer transmitter.
Some ILS installations also have a co-located low powered NDB, called a locator (L), at the site 
of the OM beacon.
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) that is frequency paired with the ILS frequencies  are 
now increasingly provided to supplement or replace the range information provided by marker 
beacons.
ILS Frequencies
Localizer
The Localizer operates in the VHF band between 108 and 111.975 MHz to provide 40 channels, 
e.g. 108.1 108.15; 108.3 108.35; 108.5 108.55 -111.95 MHz. This part of the frequency band is 
shared with VOR: the frequencies allocated are odd decimals and odd decimals + 0.05 MHz.
Glide Path
The glide path operates in the UHF band between 329.15 and 335 MHz to provide 40 
complementary channels.  e.g. 329.15, 329.3, 329.45, 329.6 - 335 MHz.
Markers
All markers transmit at 75 MHz. There is no interference problem as  the radiation pattern is a 
narrow fan-shaped vertical beam.
Frequency Pairing
The GP frequency is paired with the localizer and selection of the frequency is automatic. The 
localizer and glide path transmissions are frequency paired in accordance with the list published 
at ICAO e.g. 108.1 MHz is paired with 334.7 MHz, and 111.95 MHz is paired with 330.95 MHz. 
The advantages of this are:
•	 One switch activates both receivers - this reduces the pilot’s workload.
•	 Frequency selection is made easier and quicker as there is only one to consider.
•	 The potential for a wrong frequency selection is reduced.
•	 Only one identifier is needed.

Instrument Landing System (ILS)
DME Paired with ILS Channels
A DME that is frequency paired with an ILS supplements or replaces the range information 
from markers/locators.
The DME ranges are zero referenced to the ILS runway threshold.
The DME is protected only within the ILS localizer service area up to 25 000 ft.  When necessary 
and notified, the DME is also used for published ‘SIDs’ and ‘STARs’.  In such cases the DME 
coverage is increased.  The use of a DME outside the stated limits may give rise to errors.
ILS Identification
Separate identification is unnecessary for ILS localizer and glide path transmissions as the 
localizer and glide path frequencies are paired.  The selection of the localizer VHF frequency 
automatically energizes the glide path receiver circuits.
The Ident on the localizer transmission is a 2 or 3 letter Morse signal at 7 groups/min. The first 
letter is usually “I”.
The identification is automatically suppressed if the ILS becomes unserviceable or is withdrawn. 
When an ILS is undergoing maintenance, or is radiating for test purposes only, the identification 
coding will either be removed completely or replaced by a continuous tone.  Under these 
conditions no attempt should be made to use the ILS as completely erroneous indications may 
be received. 
Additionally, in some instances, because of an unserviceable glide path, the ILS may be radiating 
for localizer approaches only, in which case the identification coding will be radiating.  In this 
case ATC will warn all users of this fact and no attempt should be made to use the glide path.
Marker Beacons
Two markers are required for each installation and a third may be added if considered necessary 
at a particular site.
When a marker is used in conjunction with the back course of a localizer, it should have an 
identification signal that is clearly distinguishable from the front course markers.

The radiation patterns for ILS marker beacons is vertical and appears  lens shaped  or bone 
shaped in plan view.  Figures 9.2 and 9.3 show the horizontal and vertical profiles of ILS marker 
beacons. The signal is only received if the aircraft is flying within the fan; it is not a directional 
aid.  Reception is indicated by synchronous aural identifiers and lights as shown in the following 
table.

Z markers have cylindrical vertical radiation patterns. They are used to mark airway reporting 
points or co-located with an NDB. Due to the cone of silence directly above an NDB, either Z 
markers or fan-shaped markers provide an indication when the aircraft is overhead.

Ground Monitoring of ILS Transmissions
Both the localizer and the glide path are automatically monitored by equipment located in an 
area of guaranteed reception.  This equipment will act when:
•	 the localizer at the reference datum shifts from the runway centre line by more than 35 ft 
for Cat I, 25 ft for Cat II or 20 ft for Cat III.
•	 the glide path angle changes more than 0.075 × basic glide path angle.
•	 there is a power reduction in output of more than 50% from any transmitter.
The monitoring unit will provide warning to a control point and cause any of the following to 
occur before a standby transmitter is activated:
•	 Cessation of all radiation.
•	 Removal of identification and navigational components of the carrier.
•	 Cat II or III ILS may permit operation to the lower categories I or II.
ILS Coverage
Localizer
The localizer coverage sector extends from the transmitter to distances of:
•	 25 NM (46.3 km) within plus or minus 10° from the centre line.
•	 17 NM (31.5 km) between 10° and 35° from the centre line.
•	 10 NM (18.5 km) outside ± 35° if coverage is provided.
These limits may be reduced to 18 NM within 10° sector and 10 NM within the remainder of 
the coverage when alternative navigational facilities provide satisfactory coverage within the 
intermediate approach area.
Glide Path
The glide path coverage extends from the transmitter to a distance of at least:
10 NM (18.5 km) in sectors of 8° in azimuth on each side of the centre line.
The vertical coverage is provided from 0.45θ up to 1.75θ above the horizontal where θ is the 
promulgated glide path angle. The lower limit may be reduced to 0.3θ if required to safeguard 
the promulgated glide path intercept procedure.
ILS coverage is illustrated in Figures 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7.
Note: These are the sectors within which the ILS localizer and glide path emissions must provide 
correct indications.  Radiated energy exists outside these vertical and horizontal sectors.

Instrument Landing System (ILS)
ILS Principle of Operation
The Localizer
The localizer antenna produces two overlapping lobes along the runway approach direction 
(QDM) as shown in Figure 9.8.  The lobes are transmitted on a single VHF ILS frequency.  In 
order that an aircraft’s ILS receiver can distinguish between the lobes:
•	 the right hand lobe (the blue sector) has a 150 Hz modulation.
•	 the left hand lobe (the yellow sector) has a 90 Hz modulation.
The depth of modulation (DoM) increases away from the centre line i.e. the amplitude of the 
modulating signal increases away from the centre line. An aircraft approaching the runway 
centre line from the right will receive more of the 150 Hz signal than the 90 Hz modulation.  This 
difference in depth of modulation (DDM) relates to the angular displacement of the aircraft 
from the centre line; it energizes the vertical needle of the ILS indicator, i.e. Go Left.
Similarly an aircraft approaching the runway centre line from the left will receive more of the 
90 Hz signal than the 150 Hz modulation; the DDM energises the vertical needle, i.e. Go Right.
A DDM of zero indicates a balance between modulations, a zero needle-deflection and hence 
the runway centre line.
Back Course ILS
There is a mirror image behind the localizer aerial so ILS indications are received on aircraft 
equipment.  Back Course ILS is used in some countries but is not permitted in the United 
Kingdom. Ignore any back course indications in the United Kingdom. 
The back course ILS has the following disadvantages:
•	 The glide path indications are incorrect (they would, if used guide the aircraft to the wrong 
end of the runway).
•	 The CDI needle (localizer) is sense reversed. (Flying to R/W).
•	 There are no range-check markers.

Figure 9.9 Glide path radiation pattern
Glide Slope
The glide slope UHF transmitter is located to one side of the runway approximately 200 m from 
the runway edge, 300 m upwind of the threshold.
The same principle is used as for the localizer, but a UHF carrier wave is used and the lobes 
are in the vertical plane. The upper lobe (large lobe) has a 90 Hz modulation, and the bottom 
lobe (small lobe) has a 150 Hz modulation.  The glide path, usually 3° (ICAO require glide path 
angle between 2° and 4°), is defined where the DDM of the overlapping lobes is zero and the 
ILS indicator’s glide path needle will indicate zero deviation. The radiation pattern is shown in 
Figure 9.9.
False Glide Slope(s)
These are defined as the paths of points, in the vertical plane, containing the runway centre 
line at which the DDM is zero; other than that path of points forming the ILS glide path.  The 
twin lobes are repeated due to:
•	 Metallic structures situated at the transmission point, and ground reflections.
•	 The height and propagation characteristics of the aerial.
The first false glide slope occurs at approximately twice the glide path angle, 6° above ground 
for a standard 3° glide path. False glide slopes always occur above the true glide slope and 
should not constitute a danger but pilots should be aware of their presence.
Normal flying practice is to establish on the localizer and intercept the glide slope from below. 
However at airfields such as London Heathrow a continuous descent approach is used in 
which the aircraft are positioned by ground radar to capture the glide slope from above. It 
is advisable to always confirm the aircraft height in relation to distance to go by reference to 
DME, markers, locators etc.

ILS Reference Datum Point
The ILS reference datum point is a point at a specified height (around 50 feet) located vertically 
above the intersection of the runway centre line and threshold, through which the downward 
extended portion of the ILS glide path extends.  This value is to be found in the remarks column 
for the particular airfield in the UK AIP, AD section.
Visual Glide Path Indicators 
The approach light systems such as PAPIs give a visual indication of the glide path to the runway 
that would be the same as that for the ILS so that during the final phase of the approach 
the pilot should get similar indications of glide path from both systems. However the visual 
indications are designed for a mean eye height (meht) of the pilot and they would therefore 
vary slightly since the pilot’s position will vary depending upon the size of the aircraft.
ILS Presentation and Interpretation
Indicators 
Localizer and glide path information can be displayed:
•	 on a Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) or
•	 on the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI).
Interpretation of a CDI display is shown in Figure 9.10. The HSI display is shown at Figure 9.11. 
The main difference to note is that on the HSI there is a course selector which should be set on 
the QDM of the runway. The deviation indications then appear in the correct sense.

•	 give azimuth guidance on overshoot from main precision approach runway, when the CDI 
or HSI needle should be obeyed, or
•	 give back course approach to the reciprocal of the main precision approach runway.  In this 
case the CDI needle will give reverse indications whereas an HSI will give correct indications 
provided that the front course QDM has been selected.

Glide Path Indications
The glide path indication for fly up or fly down is shown in Figure 9.13. Full scale deflection 
indicates that the aircraft is 0.7° or more above or below the glide path. The sensitivity is 
0.14° per dot.  Note that the maximum safe deviation below the glideslope is half full-scale 
deflection i.e. 2.5 dots fly up.
Figure 9.13 Glide path
Note: If, on approach, the left/right deflections or the fly-up indications exceed half full scale 
then an immediate go-around should be initiated because safe terrain clearance may be 
compromised.

ILS Categories (ICAO)
ILS Facility Performance Categories (Ground Installation)
Category I  
A category I ILS is one which provides guidance information from the coverage limit of the ILS 
to the point at which the localizer course line intersects the ILS glide path at a height of 200 ft  
(60 m) or less above the horizontal plane containing the threshold.
Category II  
An ILS which provides guidance information from the coverage limit of the ILS to the point at 
which the localizer course line intersects the ILS glide path at a height of 50 ft (15 m) or less 
above the horizontal plane containing the threshold.
Category III   
An ILS, which with the aid of ancillary equipment where necessary, provides guidance 
information from coverage limit of the facility to, and along, the runway surface.
Operational Performance Categories
The improvement in the ground installations allows guidance down to the surface of a runway 
and requires a corresponding  improvement in the airborne equipment.  An aircraft may be 
certified to operate to one of the following classifications:
Category I	
An instrument approach and landing with :
•	 a DH not lower than 60 m (200 ft) and
•	 a Runway Visual Range (RVR) not less than 550 m.
Category II	
A precision instrument approach and landing with
•	 a DH lower than 60 m (200 ft) but not lower than 30 m (100 ft) and
•	 a RVR not less than 300 m.
Category IIIA	
A precision instrument approach and landing with:
•	 a DH lower  than 30 m (100 ft), or no DH; and
•	 a RVR not less than 200 m.
Category IIIB	
A precision instrument approach and landing with:
•	 a DH lower than 15 m (50 ft), or no DH; and
•	 a RVR less than 200 m but not less than 75 m.

Instrument Landing System (ILS)
Category IIIC	
No DH and no RVR limitations.
The acceptance of category II or III operations will depend on whether the following criteria 
are met:
•	 the aeroplane has suitable flight characteristics.
•	 the aeroplane will be operated by a qualified crew in conformity with laid down procedures.
•	 the aerodrome is suitably equipped and maintained.
•	 it can be shown that the required safety level can be maintained.
Errors and Accuracy
The Instrument Landing System has several limitations in that indications can be affected by:
•	 beam bends caused by atmospheric conditions
•	 scalloping caused by reflections which results in rapid fluctuations of the needles on the 
CDI/HSI which are impossible to follow; and
•	 beam noise generated by the transmitter or due to interference.
The pilot must be alert to the existence of potential problems and constantly cross-check the 
information which is being received.
•	 To minimize interference to the ILS transmissions, the rate of landings has to be kept 
relatively low, and also vehicle and aircraft movement must be restricted on the ground, 
especially during low visibility procedures.
•	 Pilot’s serviceability checks of the localizer and glide path may be checked by:
◦◦
ensuring the warning flags are not visible.
◦◦
the pilot monitoring the identification signals.  Cessation of the Ident means that the 
ILS is unserviceable and the procedure must be discontinued immediately.
Factors Affecting Range and Accuracy
ILS Multipath Interference Due to Large Reflecting Objects
Multipath interference to ILS signals is dependent upon antenna characteristics plus any large 
reflecting objects, vehicles and fixed structures within the radiated signal coverage. Moving 
objects can degrade the directional signals to an unacceptable extent.
In order to protect the ILS signals from interference, protected areas are defined:
•	 ILS Critical Area.   This is an area of defined dimensions about the localizer and glide 
path antennae where vehicles and aircraft are excluded during all ILS 
operations. It is protected because the presence of vehicles and/or 
aircraft inside its boundaries will cause unacceptable disturbance to the 
ILS signal-in-space.
--- Page 166 ---

Instrument Landing System (ILS)
•	 ILS Sensitive Area  This extends beyond the critical area and is where parking or movement 
of vehicles and aircraft is controlled to prevent the possibility of 
unacceptable interference to the ILS signal during low visibility ILS 
operations. The dimensions of this area depend upon the object 
creating the disturbance.
•	 Holding points        Protection of ILS signals during category II and III operations may 
dictate that pre-take-off holding points are more distant from the 
runway than holding positions used in good weather.  Such holding 
positions will be appropriately marked and will display signs ‘Category 
II/III Hold’; there may also be a bar of red stop lights.
Weather 
Snow and heavy rain attenuates the ILS signals thereby reducing the range and degrading the 
accuracy.
FM Broadcasts  
FM transmitters have wide bandwidths and it is possible for such stations transmitting on 
frequencies just below 108 MHz to produce frequencies that overspill into the radio navigation 
band (108 to 117.975 MHz ) thereby causing interference with the ILS signals. Since the late 
1990s FM suppression circuits have been mandatory in ILS receivers.
ILS Approach Chart
An Instrument Approach Chart for an ILS approach is shown in Figure 9.14. The instrument 
approach can be divided into the following 3 segments:
•	 Initial approach - procedure up to the IAF (initial approach fix).
•	 Intermediate - procedure between IAF and FAF (final approach fix).
•	 Final approach - procedure after FAF.
An aircraft should be at or above certain altitudes depending upon the sector from which it is 
approaching. These are known as sector safety altitudes (SSA) and are denoted in some form 
on the chart (circular in top left on this one).
Landing minima relates to the pilot’s decision height (DH) and the RVR. Before commencing 
the approach the pilot would normally be advised by ATC to check his landing minima.

ILS Calculations
When flying an ILS approach it would be sensible to predict the rate of descent required on 
approaching the glide path, and prudent to have a check on height when established on the 
glide path.  These can be simply achieved by using the 1:60 rule.
Example:  An aircraft is at 4 NM from touchdown flying a 3° glide path at a groundspeed of 
150 kt. Determine the height the aircraft should be and the rate of descent required.
To determine height by the 1:60 rule:
This can be simplified to:
This gives:   
The trigonometric solution, using accurate values gives a height of 1274 ft, so the use of the 
simple 1:60 formula does underestimate the height. However, we are using this as a check for 
gross errors.
To determine the rate of descent (ROD) required, using the 1:60 rule:
Find the change of height per NM and then multiply that by the speed in NM/minute:
For a 3° glide path:
Hence, for the example the ROD required will be 750 feet per minute (fpm).
As with the height this is an approximation and will slightly underestimate the actual ROD, 
which works out trigonometrically as 796 fpm.
Note:  This is only valid for a 3° glide path. For any other glide path angle, calculate for a 3° 
glide path then divide by 3 and multiply by the glide path angle (or calculate on your 
Navigation Computer).

Microwave Landing System (MLS)
Introduction
The Microwave Landing System (MLS) was designed to replace ILS with an advanced precision 
approach system that would overcome the disadvantages of ILS and also provide greater 
flexibility to its users.  However, there are few MLS installations in use at present and they are 
likely to co-exist with ILS for a long time.
MLS is a precision approach and landing system that provides position information and 
various ground to air data. The position information is provided in a wide coverage sector 
and is determined by an azimuth angle measurement, an elevation measurement and a range 
measurement.
ILS Disadvantages
ILS has the following disadvantages:
•	 There are only 40 channels available worldwide.
•	 The azimuth and glide slope beams are fixed and narrow. As a result, aircraft have to be 
sequenced and adequately separated which causes landing delays.
•	 There are no special procedures available for slower aircraft, helicopters, and Short Take-off 
and Landing (STOL) aircraft.
•	 ILS cannot be sited in hilly areas and it requires large expanses of flat, cleared land to 
minimize interference with the localizer and glide slope beams.
•	 Vehicles, taxiing aircraft, low-flying aircraft and buildings have to be kept well away from 
the transmission sites to minimize localizer and glide slope course deviations (bending of 
the beams).
The MLS System
The Microwave Landing System (MLS) has the following features:
•	 There are 200 channels available worldwide.
•	 The azimuth coverage is at least ± 40° of the runway on-course line (QDM) and glide slopes 
from 0.9° to 20° can be selected.  The usable range is 20-30 NM from the MLS site; 20 NM 
in the UK.
•	 There is no problem with back course transmissions; a secondary system is provided to give 
overshoot and departure guidance ± 20° of runway direction up to 15° in elevation to a 
range of 10 NM and a height of 10 000 ft.
•	 It operates in the SHF band, 5031 - 5090.7 MHz.  This enables it to be sited in hilly areas 
without having to level the site.  Course deviation errors (bending) of the localizer and glide 
path caused by aircraft, vehicles and buildings are no longer a problem because the MLS 
scanning beam can be interrupted and therefore avoids the reflections.
•	 Because of its increased azimuth and elevation coverage aircraft can choose their own 
approaches. This will increase runway utilization and be beneficial to helicopters and STOL 
aircraft.

Microwave Landing System (MLS)
•	 The MLS has a built-in DME.
•	 MLS is compatible with conventional localizer and glide path instruments, EFIS, auto-pilot 
systems and area navigation equipment.
•	 MLS gives positive automatic landing indications plus definite and continuous on/off flag 
indications for the localizer and glide slope needles.
•	 The identification prefix for the MLS is an ‘M’ followed by two letters. 
•	 The aim is for all MLS equipped aircraft to operate to CAT III criteria. Figures 10.1, 10.2 and 
10.3 below show some of these features.

Microwave Landing System (MLS)
Principle of Operation
MLS employs the principle of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) (see Figure 10.5) whereby only 
one frequency is used on a channel but the transmissions from the various angle and data 
ground equipments are synchronized to assure interference free operations on the common 
radio frequency.
•	 Azimuth location.  Time referenced scanning beam (TRSB) is utilized in azimuth and 
elevation as follows: the aircraft computes its azimuth position in relation to the runway 
centre line by measuring the time interval in microseconds between the reception of the 
‘to’ and ‘fro’ scanning beams.
The beam starts the ‘to’ sweep at one extremity of its total scan and travels at a uniform 
speed to the other extremity.  It then starts its ‘fro’ scan back to its start position. The time 
interval between the reception of the ‘to’ and ‘fro’ pulses is proportional to the angular 
position of the aircraft in relation to the runway on-course line.
The pilot can choose to fly the runway on-course line (QDM) or an approach path which he 
selects as a pre determined number of degrees ± the runway direction. (See Figure 10.4).
•	 Glide slope location.  Another beam scans up and down at a uniform speed within its 
elevation limits. The aircraft’s position in relation to its selected glide slope angle is thus 
calculated in the same manner by measuring the time difference between the reception of 
the pulses from the up and down sweep. The transmissions from the two beams and the 
transmissions from the other components of the MLS system are transmitted at different 
intervals i.e. it uses ‘ time multiplexing’.
•	 Other components of the system are:
◦◦
Flare. Although the standard has been developed to provide for flare elevation, this 
function is not intended for future implementation.
◦◦
Back azimuth. Gives go-around and departure guidance ± 20° of runway direction up 
to 15° in elevation.
◦◦
DME. Range along the MLS course is provided not by markers but by a DME. For Cat 
II and III approaches a precision DME (DME/P) that is accurate to within 100 feet must 
be available.
•	 Transmission of auxiliary data. This consists of:
◦◦
station identification
◦◦

Airborne Equipment
The airborne equipment is designed to continuously display the position of the aircraft in 
relation to the preselected course and glide path along with distance information during 
approach as well as during departure.
Display
The display consists of two cross bars similar to an ILS display except that the indications are 
given relative to the selective course.  It is possible to program the computer to give segmented 
approaches and curved approaches for which a DME-P must be installed on the ground.
Control Unit
In order to receive ILS, MLS and GPS transmissions, aircraft are equipped with multi-mode 
receivers and a combined control unit for ease of use by the flight crew. An example of such a 
control unit is shown at Figure 10.6.

Radar Principles
Introduction
Radar stands for RAdio Detection And Ranging and was developed prior to World War II. It 
was used both on the ground as well as in the air by the military. Originally it used pulses for its 
operation but subsequently continuous wave (CW) techniques were also developed for other 
functions such as the radio altimeter, because CW radars have no minimum range limitation. 
Today radar is also extremely important in civil aviation. It is used by ground based radars in 
the control, separation and navigation of aircraft as well as in airborne systems for weather 
warning and navigation.
Figure 11.1 
Radar is the Transmission of Electromagnetic Radio Energy
and the Detection of some of the 
back at the point of Transmission
Types of Pulsed Radars
A Primary Radar uses pulses of radio energy reflected from a target i.e. it uses one frequency 
throughout.
A Secondary Radar transmits pulses on one frequency, but receives on a different frequency 
i.e. the object transmits its own energy. It is a system utilizing an interrogator and transponder; 
the transponder can be located in the aircraft or on the ground.
This will be covered in detail in Chapter 14.

Radar Applications
Radar has a wide range of applications as follows:
Air Traffic Control uses radar to:
•	 monitor aircraft in relation to each other whilst they are flying on airways, in control zones 
or in the airfield vicinity, and to vector the aircraft if necessary.
•	 provide radar talk-down to a given runway (Surveillance Radar Approach (SRA) or a military 
Precision Approach Radar (PAR)).
•	 control and  monitor  aircraft  on ILS let-downs, or during airfield instrument approaches.
•	 provide information regarding weather e.g. storm clouds.
Air/Ground navigational systems use radar:
•	 Secondary Surveillance Radar provides ATC with information regarding an aircraft’s call 
sign, altitude, speed, track history, destination and type of emergency when appropriate.
•	 Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) provides a pilot with very accurate slant ranges 
from a ground based receiver/transmitter known as a transponder.
Airborne Weather Radar (AWR) is used to:
•	 depict the range and bearing of clouds.
•	 indicate areas of the heaviest precipitation and associated turbulence. 
•	 calculate the height of cloud.
•	 ground map.

Radar Principles
Radar Frequencies
Radar systems are in the VHF and above frequency bands because:
•	 these frequencies are free from external noise/static and ionospheric scatter.
•	 the shorter wavelengths produce narrow, efficient beams for target discrimination and 
bearing measurement.
•	 the shorter wavelengths can produce shorter pulses.
•	 efficient reflection from an object depends upon its size in relation to the wavelength; 
shorter wavelengths are reflected more efficiently.
Pulse Technique
Primary and secondary radar systems use the pulse technique which is the transmission of radio 
energy in very short bursts.  Each burst of energy is in a pulse form of a predetermined shape. 
The duration of the pulse is equal to the pulse length or width.  Although a pulse is of short 
width (time) it can contain many cycles.

The distance to an object is found by timing the interval between the instant of the pulse’s 
transmission and its return as an echo; this is shown in Figure 11.3.
For example, if the echo (the time between transmission and reception) is 500 µs then:

Radar Principles
Theoretical Maximum Range
Relationship to PRF
Maximum theoretical range is determined by the PRF i.e. the number of pulses transmitted 
in one second (pps)  Each pulse must be allowed to travel to the most distant object planned 
before the next pulse is transmitted; to do otherwise makes it impossible to relate a particular 
echo to a particular pulse. The maximum range is therefore related to the PRF such that the 
greater the range required, the lower the PRF used.
Examples
1.	
We wish a radar to measure a range of up to 187 km. What should the PRF (PRR) be?
2.	
What is the maximum PRR for a radar required to measure up to 200 NM?
3.	
Maximum range for a radar is to be 170 km. What is the maximum PRR?
4.	
An AWR has a 400 pps PRR.  Calculate the maximum range in nautical miles for this 
equipment.
Answers
1.	
The pulse must travel 374 km (2 × 187) before the next pulse transmission.
	
The time for the journey, T = D/S	
=     374 000/300 000 000 seconds
	
  	
	
	
=     0.0012466 s   =   1246 µs
	
	
      i.e. 	PRI	
=     1246 µs.
	
Thus the second pulse can only leave 1246 µs after the first.
	
PRF (pps) = 1/ PRI = 1/ 1246 µs = 1 000 000 / 1246 = 802 pps
	
Alternately we can say that PRF = 300 000 000 / 374 000 = 802 pps

Practical Range
The practical range for the radar is less than the maximum theoretical range because the 
trace on the CRT (cathode ray tube) needs a period of time to return to the point of origin. 
This period is called the fly-back or dead time. During this period returning echoes cannot be 
displayed thereby reducing the range achievable for a given PRF.

Radar Principles
Primary Radars
The pulses are concentrated into the beam dimensions designed for the particular radar. The 
beam uses the ‘echo’ principle to determine range and the ‘searchlight’ principle to indicate 
bearing or height. Figure 11.4 shows the Plan Position Indicator (PPI) display and Figure 11.5 
shows the ATC radar antennae. The long structures at the top of the primary radar antennae 
are the secondary radar antennae.
The transmitter and receiver share the same antenna. The receiver is energized to accept 
‘echoes’ from objects in the pulses’ path as soon as the transmitter pulse exits the antenna. 
The reflected pulses are very weak due to the double journey.
The shape and size of the radar antennae determines the size of the main and side lobes as well 
as the width of the radar beam generated by the system. The larger the aerial, the narrower 
will be the beam.

Radar Principles
The Range of Primary Radar
Maximum Range
The range of a primary radar depends upon the strength of the returning pulses that determines 
the quality of the target depiction on the PPI. The range is affected by several factors:
•	 Transmission power. A radar signal attenuates with increasing distance from the transmitter. 
As the signal has to travel out and back the power/range relationship is:
Power available is proportional to the fourth power of range which means that the power 
has increased by a factor of 16 to double the range
•	 Characteristics of reflecting objects. Metals are more efficient than wood at reflecting 
the transmitted signal and the size and shape of the detected object make a considerable 
difference to the effective range. The aspect of the object also affects the range; for 
instance, a manoeuvring aircraft presents various aspects which can affect the polarization 
of reflected waves.  The side of the fuselage has a better aspect than the nose of the aircraft.
•	 Aircraft height and the height of the radar head. Radar transmissions, because of their 
frequency bands, travel in straight lines and give line of sight ranges, plus a little extra due 
to atmospheric refraction.  Thus the curvature of the earth causes much of the surface to 
be in shadow.  Therefore, higher flying aircraft are more likely to be detected because they 
are above that shadow.  Intervening high ground also will screen low flying aircraft from 
detection.  The higher the radar head can be positioned, the greater that radar’s range and 
the less effect intervening high ground will have on stopping signals and reducing its range. 
The following formula can be used to calculate the maximum theoretical radar range:

(√ HTX +  √ HRX)

Radar Principles
It can be seen from Figure 11.6 that energy is absorbed and scattered by raindrops; the total 
effect depends upon the size of the water droplets and the transmitted wavelengths. At 
wavelengths longer than 10 cm the attenuation is negligible.  If the wavelength is between 
10 cm and 4 cm the attenuation is significant only in tropical rain.  However, with wavelengths 
less than 4 cm, attenuation is significant in rain in the temperate latitudes.  One conclusion is 
that wavelengths less than 3 cm should not be used for long range systems.  Airfield Surface 
Movement Indicator (ASMI) radars operate at 1.75 to 2 cm wavelengths. Airborne Weather 
Radars (AWR) and Precision Approach Radars (PAR) use 3 cm wavelengths. Surveillance 
radars (ground) use 10, 23 or 50 cm wavelengths.
•	 Atmospheric conditions. Certain atmospheric conditions can actually increase the range 
of radar pulses by refracting the waves which would normally travel in straight lines. This 
is called super-refraction and it gives radar ranges beyond normal line of sight i.e. it gives 
over the horizon radar capability by causing the radio waves to refract downwards towards 
the earth’s surface. Such conditions occur when there is a temperature inversion and a 
decrease in humidity with height. On the other hand, atmospheric conditions can also 
cause sub-refraction in which the theoretical range of the radar is reduced by causing the 
waves to refract upwards away from the surface.

Figure 11.7 Pulse Width Decides Minimum Range
•	 Restoration Time is a design factor that affects the time taken for a receiver to recover to 
normal after transmission has occurred.
•	 Pulse width determines the minimum range.  With reference to Figure 11.7, it can be shown 
that a pulse 1 µs wide would extend 300 metres.  Thus an object at 150 metres reflecting 
this pulse would cause it to arrive back at the receiver as its tail was leaving the transmitter.
Any object closer than 150 metres would reflect a pulse that could not be received as the 
transmitter would still be transmitting. Furthermore, two objects in line 150 metres or less 
apart would appear as a single return.  As a result, if short range operation is required for 
target resolution and accuracy, short pulses are used, e.g.  0.1 µs.

Question	
A surface movement radar is required to measure down to 500 m. Calculate the 
maximum pulse width in microseconds.
Answer	
3.3 µs
Radar Measurements
Bearing 
Bearing measurement is obtained by using the searchlight principle.  Radio pulses are 
concentrated into very narrow beams which are produced by shortening the wavelength or 
increasing the aerial size and in advanced systems this is done electronically.  The beam is 
rotated at a constant speed. The PPI display is synchronized with the antenna rotation. The 
direction of an object is the direction of the beam, measured from a fixed datum, at the time 
when the echo is received.
Range 
Calculated from the time interval between the transmission and reception of the radar pulse.
Harmonization 
In order that bearing and range information can be determined from the radar system it is 
necessary to harmonize the rotary speed of the antenna, the pulse duration or width, the pulse 
repetition frequency, focusing and transmission power.
Radar Resolution
The image painted on a PPI display from a point target will not be a single point but will appear 
as a rectangle, known as the radar resolution rectangle i.e. the target appears to be stretched 
both radially and in azimuth. The dimensions of the rectangle depend upon the pulse length, 
the beamwidth and the spot size.
The radial resolution is dependent upon half the pulse length. For example, a pulse length of 
1 μs would stretch the target by 150 metres (distance that an electromagnetic wave travels in 
0.5 µs). If two targets happen to be within half pulse width they will be illuminated simultaneously 
by the pulse and return only a single echo to the receiver.
The azimuth resolution is dependent upon the full beamwidth. Therefore a 3° beamwidth at 
a range of 120 km would stretch the target in azimuth by 6 km (using the 1 in 60 rule).
It follows therefore that in order to resolve adjacent targets the radar should have short pulse 
lengths and narrow beamwidths. However shortening the pulse length reduces the time the 
target is illuminated by the pulse and reduces the chance of a good return being received. 
Beamwidths can only be narrowed by increasing the size of the antenna.
The spot size and the target size also increase the size of the echo displayed on the PPI screen.
Moving Target Indication (MTI)
Surveillance radar equipment incorporates circuitry designed to eliminate returns from 
stationary objects such as hills or buildings which would give returns that would mask the 
smaller returns from aircraft. By erasing the permanent echoes the radar is able to display only 
the moving targets such as aircraft.

Radar Principles
It is possible for a radar receiver on MTI to produce false targets as a result of second trace 
returns i.e. a return of the preceding pulse from a target beyond the maximum range selected, 
appearing during the period of the next pulse as a moving target within the selected range. In 
order to overcome this problem, MTI radars remove second trace returns by changing the PRI 
between consecutive pulses, a technique known as ‘jittering the PRF’.
Radar Antennae
The microwave horn, parabolic reflector and slotted planar array (or flat plate antenna) 
shown in Figure 11.8 and Figure 11.9 are popular antennae which are used extensively in 
radar and satellite systems.  Microwave horns are very often used as feeds for large parabolic 
reflectors. Both the parabolic reflector and the flat plate antennae generate main lobes 
as well as side lobes. Most radars will incorporate circuits for side lobe suppression so that 
echoes from the side lobes do not interfere with the main pulse returns. Figure 11.10 shows a 
radiation pattern with the main and side lobes of a parabolic reflector.  The slotted planar array 
produces a narrower beam with much smaller side lobes hence reducing the power required 
and improving the resolution.

Ground Radar
Introduction
Air Traffic Control services use ground radars extensively to serve a large number of requirements 
and users. They employ both primary radar and secondary radar techniques. Primary Radar is 
used to detect aircraft not equipped with a Secondary Radar Transponder. It may incorporate 
Moving Target Indication (MTI). The services that can be offered by Air Traffic Controllers are 
Information, Surveillance or Guidance.
Primary radar systems used by ATC include:
•	 Area Surveillance Radar (ASR)
•	 Terminal Area Surveillance Radar (TAR)
•	 Aerodrome Surveillance Radar
•	 Precision Approach Radar (PAR)
•	 Airport  Surface Movement Radar (ASMR)
Area Surveillance Radars (ASR)
These are long range radars (200 to 300 NM) used for airway surveillance to provide range and 
bearing of aircraft. (Additional information is provided by Secondary Surveillance Radar - SSR). 
Figures 12.1 and 12.2 show the locations and coverage of the London ACC and Scottish ACC 
radars and Figure 12.3 shows the UK Airways structure.

For the long range radars the wavelengths and pulse lengths are relatively long (10 to 50 cm 
and 2 to 4 µs respectively). The longer pulse length ensures that the target is illuminated for 
sufficient time to give a good return. The PRF and antenna rotation rate (scan rate) are low - 
300 to 400 pps and 5 to 6 rpm respectively. This ensures that the next pulse is not transmitted 
until the first one has had sufficient time to return from the long range target.
Terminal Surveillance Area Radars
These are medium range radars, up to 75 NM, used for controlling traffic in TMAs. (Additional 
information is provided by Secondary Surveillance Radar - SSR).
Typical wavelengths are 10 cm, 23 cm and 50 cm with pulse widths 1 to 3 µs.
In the UK horizontal radar separation minima may be reduced to 3 NM (5.6 km) within 40 NM 
(or in certain circumstances 60 NM) of the radar head and below FL245 where the procedure 
has been officially approved.

Aerodrome Surveillance Approach Radars
These are short range radars providing positional information up to 25 NM.  Their wavelengths 
are 3 cm or 10 cm with pulse widths of 0.5 to 1 µs. They provide:
•	 Positional information and control of aircraft in the aerodrome vicinity, Approach Radar 
(RAD)
•	 Radar Vectoring to the ILS
•	 Surveillance Radar Approach (SRA)
Airport Surface Movement Radar (ASMR)
This is also known as AIRFIELD SURFACE MOVEMENT INDICATOR (ASMI) and is installed 
at major airfields to provide a very accurate radar display (in all weathers and conditions of 
visibility) of the aerodrome infrastructure, (taxi-ways, runways, aprons etc.), vehicular traffic 
and aircraft that are stationary, taxiing, landing or taking off.
ASMI radar is designed to provide a detailed, bright and flicker-free display of all aircraft 
and vehicles on runways and taxiways so that Air Traffic Control Officers can be certain that 
runways are clear of traffic before landings or take-offs, and to enable them to  ensure the safe 
and orderly movement of traffic on taxiways. Processing can remove selected fixed features 
leaving targets on runways and taxiways, etc., clearly visible.  This is shown in Figure 12.4; the 
aircraft taking off is a DC9.
The very high definition required by these radars is achieved by designing a radar with:
•	 a very narrow beam in the order of 0.2° to 1°.
•	 a scanner rotation rate of 60 rpm.
•	 a PRF in the order of 4000 to 20 000 pps.
•	 pulse widths in the order of 0.03 µs.
•	 frequencies of 15 to 17 GHz (SHF), 2 to 1.76 cm wavelengths.
•	 ranges of 2.5 to 6 NM in light precipitation.
The frequencies required for ASMI result in the transmissions being increasingly attenuated and 
absorbed as the intensity of precipitation increases.  This has the effect of reducing the radar’s 
range, but this is not a significant problem as the radars are only required to cover the environs 
of the airfield. The EHF band is not suitable for an ASMI radar as the degree of attenuation in 
most types of precipitation reduces its effective operational range and capabilities.

Airborne Weather Radar
Introduction
Airborne weather radar (AWR) is used to provide pilots with information regarding weather 
ahead as well as navigation. Unlike most other systems, it requires interpretation by the pilot 
and its use is enhanced by the skill of the user.
The radar information can be displayed on a dedicated unit or shown (on modern aircraft) in 
combination with the aircraft route on the EFIS navigation display (ND).
Information on cloud formations or terrain features is displayed on the indicator’s screen 
as a range from the aircraft and a bearing relative to its heading. The presentation can be 
monochrome or, on modern systems, in the colours green, yellow, red and/or magenta.  In the 
weather mode the colours represent the increasing variations in rainfall rate from light to very 
strong returns; magenta usually indicates the presence of turbulence associated with intense 
rainfall.  For ground mapping green indicates light ground returns, yellow medium ground 
returns and red heavy ground returns.
Component Parts
The airborne equipment comprises:
•	 Transmitter/receiver.  (Figure 13.1)
•	 Antenna, which is stabilized in pitch and roll.  (Figure 13.1)
•	 Indicator.  (Figures 13.1, 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4)
•	 Control unit.  (Figure 13.1)
AWR Functions
The main functions of an AWR are to:
•	 detect the size of water droplets and hence deduce where the areas of turbulence are 
within the cloud.
•	 determine the height of cloud tops by tilting the radar beam up or down.
•	 map the terrain below the aircraft to provide navigational information and high ground 
avoidance.
•	 provide a position fix (range and bearing) from a prominent feature.

Airborne Weather Radar
Principle of Operation
Primary Radar
AWR is a primary radar and both of its functions, weather detection and ground mapping, use 
the echo principle to depict range and the searchlight principle to depict relative bearing of 
the targets.  For this purpose range lines and azimuth marker lines are available (see Figure 
13.2). It should be noted that the range of ground targets obtained from the display will be the 
slant range and the Pythagoras formula should be used to calculate the ground range.
Antenna
The radar beam is produced by a suitable antenna in the nose of the aircraft. The antenna 
shape can be parabolic or a flat plate which produce both a conical or pencil-shaped beam 
as well as a fan-shaped or cosecant squared beam. The type of radiation pattern will depend 
upon the use; the pencil beam is used for weather and longer range (> 60 NM) mapping while 
the fan-shaped beam is used for short range mapping. It is usually necessary to tilt the antenna 
down when using the radar in the mapping mode.  The radar antenna is attitude-stabilized 
in relation to the horizontal plane using the aircraft’s attitude reference system otherwise the 
presentation would become lopsided during manoeuvres.
Radar Beam
The pencil beam used for weather depiction has a width of between 3° and 5°. 
The beamwidth must be as narrow as possible for efficient target resolution. For example, 
two clouds at say 100 NM might appear as one large return until, at a closer range, they are 
shown correctly in Figure 13.5, as separate entities.
A narrower beam would give better definition but would require a larger antenna which 
becomes impractical in an aircraft. Therefore, in order to produce the narrower beams it is

Radar Frequency
The optimum radar frequency is one that has a wavelength comparable to the size of the 
objects which we wish to detect, namely the large water droplets and wet hail which in turn 
are associated with severe turbulence; these droplets are about 3 cm across.
The typical frequency adopted by most commercial systems is 9375 MHz, +/- 30 MHz as it 
produces the best returns from the large water droplets and wet hail found in convective clouds. 
With this frequency it is also possible to produce narrow efficient beams. The wavelength, λ is:
λ
=
300
9375
m
=
3.2 cm
A frequency higher than 9375 MHz would produce returns from smaller droplets and cause 
unnecessary clutter whereas a lower frequency would fail to produce sufficient returns to 
highlight the area of turbulence.

Water and Ice in the Radome
Some of the energy of the radar waves is absorbed by water and ice as happens in a microwave 
oven. If there is water in the antenna radome or ice on the outside of it, the energy absorbed 
will cause the water to evaporate and the ice to melt. This means that less energy is transmitted 
in the forward direction resulting in weaker returns and a degradation of performance.

Weather Depiction
The equipment is designed to detect those clouds which are likely to produce turbulence, to 
highlight the areas where the turbulence is most severe and to indicate safe routes to avoid 
them, where possible.
The size and concentration of water droplets in clouds is an indication of the presence of 
turbulence (but not of clear air turbulence - CAT).  The shorter the distance, in continuous 
rainfall, between light and strong returns, the steeper the rainfall gradient and the greater 
likelihood of turbulence. Figure 13.7 depicts the reflective levels of different precipitation 
types. For a given transmission power a 3 cm wavelength will give the best returns from large 
water droplets. Wavelengths of 10 cm and above produce few weather returns.
Figure 13.7 Reflective levels
In colour weather radar systems the weather targets are colour-coded according to the intensity 
of the rainfall as follows:
BLACK	 
Very light or no returns
Less than 0.7 mm/h.
GREEN	
Light returns
0.7 - 4 mm/h. 
YELLOW
Medium returns
4 - 12 mm/h.
RED
Strong returns	
Greater than 12 mm/h. 
MAGENTA
Turbulence
Due to rainfall intensity.
On colour systems without magenta the RED areas may have a CYCLIC function, which causes 
them to alternate RED/BLACK in order to draw the pilot’s attention.
The areas of greatest potential turbulence occur where the colour zones are closest together 
i.e. the steepest rainfall gradient.  Also turbulence is associated with the following shapes on 
the display as shown in Figures 13.8 - 13.11: U-shapes, Fingers, Scalloped edges and Hooks. 
These are areas to avoid.

Control Unit 
Figure 13.12 illustrates a basic control unit for a monochrome AWR with range scales 20, 50 and 
150 NM; its various functions are described below.
Figure 13.12 Control Unit
Power Switch
In the ON position the system is energized and the aerial is automatically stabilized in PITCH 
and ROLL.  A lopsided or asymmetric display probably indicates that the stabilization has 
failed.  Switching to the STAB OFF position will lock the scanner to the pitch and roll axes of 
the aircraft.
Range Switch
The STANDBY position is to hold the equipment in readiness during periods when the AWR is 
not required.  Selection of a range position energizes the transmitter.  Whilst on the ground 
the STANDBY position must be maintained until it is certain that personnel and any reflecting 
objects, such as hangars, are not in the radar’s transmitting sector.  The radiation can damage 
health and the reflections from adjacent structures can damage the equipment.  Selection 
of the MAPPING beam produces the same hazards. In poor weather conditions switch from 
STANDBY to the 0 - 20 NM scale as soon as the aircraft is clear of personnel and buildings 
and check the weather conditions in the take-off direction.  The maximum practical range for 
weather and for navigation is in the region of 150 NM.
Tilt Control
This control enables the radar beam to be tilted from the horizontal within 15° UP (+) and
15° DOWN (-). In the horizontal plane the antenna sweeps up to 90° either side of the nose 
though a sector of 60° on each side is generally sufficient for the role of weather depiction and 
navigation. (See Figure 13.13).
For ground mapping the beam has to be tilted down.  In order to observe cloud formations it is 
raised to reduce ground returns. It should be noted that due to the curvature of the earth the 
tilt should be higher when the selected range increases or when the aircraft descends to a 
lower altitude. Equally, the tilt setting should be lower when the selected range decreases or 
when the aircraft climbs to a higher altitude. This can be seen in Figure 13.14.

MAP
In the MAP position the radar produces a mapping beam. In order to obtain an even 
presentation of surface features, the transmitted power is progressively reduced as distance 
decreases so that the power directed to the closest object is minimum. This reduction in power 
with decreasing range is a function of the cosecant of the depression angle - hence the name 
cosecant² beam; another description is “fan-shaped” beam.  Its dimensions are 85° deep in the 
vertical plane and 3.5° in azimuth.  Signal amplification is adjustable via the adjacent MANUAL 
GAIN knob.
The minimum (15 NM) and maximum (60 to 70 NM) mapping ranges depend upon the 
aircraft’s height and type of terrain.  To map beyond 70 NM the conical pencil beam should 
be used by selecting the MANUAL position; this enables the gain to be adjusted, for ground 
mapping. See Figure 13.15.
60 - 70 NM

MAN
This is used for cloud detection and mapping between about 70 and 150 NM and selects the 
conical pencil shaped beam; MANUAL GAIN for signal amplification is operative with this 
selection.
WEA
This selects the conical pencil beam (Figure 13.14) and is the usual position for observing cloud 
formations; MANUAL GAIN control is now INOPERATIVE.  Instead a facility called Swept 
Gain, Sensitive Time Control or Automatic Gain Control (AGC) is automatically available. This 
system of circuits decreases the gain for echoes received from the ever decreasing ranges of 
clouds. It operates up to about 25 NM and ensures that the intensity (brilliance) of display 
of a particular cloud is independent of range. Thus a small cloud at 5 NM does not give an 
increasingly stronger return than a larger and more dangerous cloud at 20 NM; all clouds up to 
about 25 NM are thus compared on equal terms.
CONT
Figure 13.15 is a cloud formation presentation with CONT (CONTOUR) selected for a colour 
display; the darker colours indicate dangerous areas of concentrated rainfall and potential 
turbulence. 
The degree of danger depends upon the steepness of the rainfall gradient.  Therefore, the 
narrower the paint surrounding a red area, the greater the danger from turbulence; hooks, 
scalloped edges, finger protrusions and U-shapes are also indicators of potential areas of 
severe turbulence.  The Swept Gain facility (or automatic gain control) is also in operation in 
the CONT position and ensures that a display’s intensity does not vary as range decreases.

Mapping Operation
For the basic monochrome AWR with a maximum range of 150 NM, the cosecant² (fan-shape) 
beam is used for mapping up to about 70 NM by selecting MAP.  To map beyond 70 NM, the 
pencil beam is used by selecting the MAN position; both have manual gain control in order to 
improve the radar information obtainable from the presentation.
Adjust the downward tilt for the best target presentation.  Little energy reflects from a calm 
sea, fine sand, and flat terrain.  Therefore coastlines, built up areas, skyscrapers, bridges and 
power stations etc. will give very bright returns.  Ice has jagged edges which reflect but snow is 
a poor reflector and masks ground features. Flight over high ground can produce a false image 
of a series of lakes due to the radar shadow caused by the mountains/hills. (Figure 13.16).
Hill shadow (may give a false
impression of water)
Figure 13.16 Hill Shadow
Pre-flight Checks
Electromagnetic radiation presents a serious hazard to personnel, and electronic equipment, 
therefore great care must be taken before checking the radar on the ground. 
The following precautions should be taken:
•	 Ensure the aircraft is clear of personnel, other aircraft, vehicles and buildings.
•	 Select conical beam with maximum uptilt, then switch radar on, check you have a picture, 
then go back to standby.

Weather Operation
Avoiding Thunderstorms
Select maximum range to detect weather formations in good time and adjust the TILT to 
remove ground returns.  If the storm system is extensive make an early track adjustment, in 
consultation with ATC, to avoid it.  If this is not possible, as the clouds get nearer select the 
lower ranges and CONT and determine the best track to avoid potential turbulence.  Ensure 
that short term alterations of heading steer the aircraft away from the worst areas and not 
deeper into them.  To achieve this, constant switching between short, medium and longer 
ranges is necessary in order to maintain a complete picture of the storm system.
Shadow Area
There is also the danger of not being able to map the area behind heavy rain where no radar 
waves will penetrate; this will leave a shadow area which may contain severe weather.
Height of Storm Cloud
The height of a storm cloud can be ascertained by adjusting the tilt until the radar returns 
from it just disappear. The height of the top of the cloud can be calculated by using the 1 in 
60 rule.
It is also worth noting that a thunderstorm may not be detected if the tilt setting is set at too 
high an angle.
Height Ring
With the older AWR systems where the conical beam is produced by a dish antenna there is 
always some vertical overspill of energy which is reflected back to the aircraft and appears as a 
“height ring”, which roughly indicates the aircraft’s height.  It also indicates that the equipment 
is serviceable when there is no weather ahead.
Colour AWR Controls
The controls for a colour AWR would be similar to that for the monochrome unit in terms 
of range, tilt and gain but may have the following additional features such as Wx, Wx + T, 
Wx(var).  These are for Weather, Weather plus Turbulence and Weather with variable gain 
control. Other sets may have WxA control which stands for Weather Alert and would give a 
flashing display of the areas associated with turbulence. There may also be available a Contour 
Intensity control to enable adjustment of the display for optimum presentation. The latest 
AWR controls are activated by push ON/OFF switches located around the colour screen and 
include:
Test
This displays the colour pattern for pre-flight serviceability check.

Figure 13.17 Typical Radar System Test Pattern for PPI displays
Hold
This allows the display to be frozen so that storm movements can be assessed.  When a storm 
is located, at say 100 NM, HOLD is selected and a constant heading maintained.  HOLD and 
WX then appear alternately on the screen.  After two or three minutes deselect the HOLD 
facility; this brings back the current display and the storm position is seen to move from its held 
position to its actual position, thereby indicating its movement relative to the aircraft.
TGT Alert
This operates in conjunction with the WEA facility and alerts a pilot of a storm return of contour 
strength. When TGT ALERT is selected and no contouring clouds are present the screen shows 
a yellow T in a red square, (screen top right).  If a contouring cloud is detected within 60 to 160 
NM and +/- 15° of heading, the yellow symbol TGT, in a red square, flashes on and off once a 
second instead of the T.
Fault
This is controlled by a fault monitoring circuit and FAULT flashes on the screen if there is a 
power or transmitter failure.

Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR)
Introduction
Primary radar relies on the reception of a reflected pulse i.e. the echo of the transmitted pulse. 
Secondary radar, on the other hand, receives pulses transmitted by the target in response to 
interrogation pulses. Secondary surveillance radar (SSR) is one type of secondary radar system; 
DME is another such system that will be discussed in Chapter 15.
Both primary and secondary surveillance radars are used to track the progress of an aircraft. 
Primary radar provides better bearing and range information of an aircraft than SSR but its 
biggest disadvantage is the lack of positive, individual aircraft identification; this is required 
for adequate safe control by ATC, particularly in crowded airspace.  Primary radars also require 
higher transmitter power outputs for the two-way journey of the single pulses.
SSR requires an aircraft to be fitted with a transmitter/receiver, called a transponder.  The 
pilot will set a four-figure code allocated by ATC and the transponder will transmit information 
automatically, in pulse coded form, when it is interrogated by the ground station called the 
interrogator. The transmissions are therefore only one way from transmitter to receiver.
Advantages of SSR
SSR has the following advantages over primary radar:
•	 requires much less transmitting power to provide coverage up to 200 to 250 NM.
•	 is not dependent on an aircraft’s echoing area or aspect.
•	 gives clutter free responses as it is does not rely on returning reflected pulses.
•	 positively identifies an aircraft’s primary response by displaying its code and call sign 
alongside.
•	 indicates an aircraft’s track history, speed, altitude and destination.
•	 can indicate on a controller’s screen that an aircraft has an emergency, has lost radio 
communications or is being hi-jacked.
Thus when SSR is used in conjunction with primary radar, the advantages of both systems are 
realized. The two radars are therefore usually co-located as shown in Figures 14.1 and 14.2.
SSR Display
The SSR information is displayed in combination with the primary radar information on the 
same screen as shown in Figure 14.3. This includes the call sign or flight number, pressure 
altitude or flight level, ground speed and destination.

SSR Frequencies and Transmissions
Figure 14.4 SSR operates in the UHF band
The ground station transmits/interrogates on 1030 MHz and receives on 1090 MHz. The 
aircraft receives on 1030 MHz and transmits/transponds on 1090 MHz after a delay of 50 
microseconds. The SSR ground antenna transmits a narrow beam in the horizontal plane while 
the aircraft transmits omni-directionally i.e. the radiation pattern is circular around the aircraft.
Modes
The aircraft is interrogated from the ground station by a predetermined series of pulses on 
the carrier frequency of 1030 MHz; its transponder then transmits a coded reply on a carrier 
frequency of 1090 MHz. The two main modes of operation are:
•	 Mode A - an interrogation to identify an aircraft
•	 Mode C - an interrogation to obtain an automatic height read-out of an aircraft.
To differentiate between the interrogations three pulses (P1, P2 and P3) are always transmitted.
The spacing between P1 and P2 is fixed at 2 µs.  The spacing between P1 and P3 is 8 µs for a 
Mode A and 21 µs for a Mode C interrogation.

Figure 14.6 SSR reply pulse patterns
The aircraft transponder will reply correctly to a Mode A or C interrogation provided the pilot 
has correctly selected the mode and code allocated by ATC. On receiving a valid interrogation, 
the aircraft transponder transmits two framing pulses, F1 and F2, 20.3 µs apart.  Between the 
framing pulses there are 12 usable information pulses (pulse X is for Mode B which is at present 
unused).  A pulse can be transmitted or not, i.e. there are 212 = 4096 possible combinations of 
pulses or codes which are numbered 0000 to 7777; the figures 8 and 9 are not available.
A further pulse called the Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse may be transmitted together 
with the information pulses when the “Ident” button on the pilot’s transponder is pressed, 
usually at ATC’s request.  This pulse is after the last framing pulse and will be automatically 
and continuously transmitted for about 20 seconds.  It produces a distinctive display so that a 
controller can pick out a particular aircraft by asking the pilot to “Squawk Ident”.

Mode C
When the aircraft receives a Mode C interrogation the transponder will produce an ICAO 
determined code that corresponds to its height, referenced to 1013 hPa, regardless of the 
pressure setting on the altimeter and the code selected on the transponder. The Mode C code 
is determined by an encoder which is mechanically actuated by the altimeter’s aneroid capsule 
and is thus totally independent of the altimeter’s pressure setting.
The system provides Automatic Altitude Telemetering  up to 128 000 ft, with an output change 
(based upon 50 ft increments or decrements) every 100 ft and provides the controller with the 
aircraft’s Flight Level  or Altitude e.g. If an aircraft is flying at an allocated level of FL65, then 
065 will be displayed on the screen. If the aircraft now drifts downwards, as it passes from 
6450 ft to 6445 ft the coded transmission changes and results in 064 being indicated at the 
controller’s consol.
SSR Operating Procedure
Pilots shall:
•	 if proceeding from an area where a specific code has been assigned to the aircraft by an ATS 
unit, maintain that code setting unless otherwise instructed.
•	 select or reselect codes, or switch off the equipment when airborne only when instructed 
by an ATS unit.
•	 acknowledge code setting instructions by reading back the code to be set.
•	 select Mode C simultaneously with Mode A unless otherwise instructed by an ATS unit.
•	 when reporting vertical levels under routine procedures or when requested by ATC, read 
the current altimeter reading to the nearest 100 ft.  This is to assist in the verification of 
Mode C data transmitted by the aircraft.
Note 1:   If, on verification, there is a difference of more than 300 ft between the level read-out 
and the reported level, the pilot will normally be instructed to switch off Mode C.  If 
independent switching of Mode C is not possible the pilot will be instructed to select 
Code 0000 to indicate transponder malfunction. (Note: this is the ICAO specification)
Note 2:   A standard of ± 200 ft is applied in the UK and other countries.

Special Codes
Special Purpose Codes
Some codes are reserved internationally for special purposes and should be selected as follows:
•	 7700	
To indicate an emergency condition, this code should be selected as soon as 
is practicable after declaring an emergency situation, and having due regard 
for the over-riding importance of controlling the aircraft and containing the 
emergency.  However, if the aircraft is already transmitting a discrete code and 
receiving an air traffic service, that code may be retained at the discretion of 
either the pilot or controller.
•	 7600	
To indicate a radio failure.
•	 7500	
To indicate unlawful interference with the planned operation of the flight, 
unless circumstances warrant the operation of code 7700.
Conspicuity Code
When operating under VFR rules at and above FL100, in European airspace, pilots should select 
code 7000 + Mode C (in North America the code is 1200 + Mode C) except:
•	 when given a different setting by an ATS unit.
•	 when circumstances require the use of one of the special purpose codes.
When operating below FL100 pilots should select the Conspicuity Code and Mode C except as 
above.
MODE C should be operated with all of the above codes.
Disadvantages of SSR
Air Traffic Services in Europe have increased their reliance on SSR (which provides data on 
an aircraft’s position, identification, altitude, speed and track) but the existing civil Mode A 
(identification) and Mode C (altitude reporting) system is reaching the limits of its operational 
capability. It has the following disadvantages:
Garbling
This is caused by overlapping replies from two or more transponders on nearly the same 
bearing from the ground station and within a distance of 1.7 NM from each other measured 
on a line from the antenna. [The reply pulses from the aircraft are transmitted over a period of 
20.3 µs which relates to a distance of just under 1.7 NM in terms of radar miles.]
Fruiting
This is interference at one interrogator caused by replies from a transponder responding to 
interrogations from another.
Availability of Codes
Only 4096 identification  codes are available in Mode A.

Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) 
Mode S
Mode S is being introduced in order to overcome the limitations of the present modes A and 
C.  ‘S’ stands for Selective addressing. The new system has to be compatible with the existing 
modes  A and C so that it can be used to supplement the present system.
The main features of the new mode S are:
Availability of Codes
The aircraft address code will be made up of a 24 bit code. This means that the system will have 
over 16 700 000 discrete codes available for allocation to individual aircraft on a permanent 
basis. The code will be incorporated into the aircraft at manufacture and remain with it 
throughout its life.
Data Link
The system will be supported by a ground data network and will have the ability to handle 
uplink/downlink data messages over the horizon. Mode S can provide ground-to-air, air-to-
ground and air-to-air data exchange using communications protocols.
Reduction of Voice Communications
It is intended that the majority of the present RTF messages will be exchanged via the data 
link.  Messages to and from an aircraft will be exchanged via the aircraft’s CDU resulting in a 
reduction in voice communications.
Height Read-out
This will be in 25 ft increments and more data on an aircraft’s present and intended performance 
will be available to the ground controllers.
Interrogation Modes
Mode S operates in the following modes:
•	 All Call	
to elicit replies for acquisition of mode S transponders.
•	 Broadcast	 to transmit information to all mode S transponders (no replies are elicited).
•	 Selective	
for surveillance of, and communication with, individual mode S transponders. 
For each interrogation, a reply is elicited only from the transponder uniquely 
addressed by the interrogation.
•	 Intermode	 mode A/C/S All Call would be used to elicit replies for surveillance of mode A/C 
transponders and for the acquisition of mode S transponders.
Pulses
Mode S does not transmit the P3 pulse, but has an additional P4 pulse, which can be either 
long or short in duration.
Intermode A/C/S All Call 
Interrogation will consist of P1, P2, P3 and the long P4 pulses.

Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR)
Intermode A/C only All Call 
Interrogation will consist of P1, P2, P3 and the short P4 pulses.
Benefits of Mode S
Unambiguous Aircraft Identification
This will be achieved as each aircraft will be assigned a unique address from one of almost 17 
million which together with automatic flight identity reporting allows unambiguous aircraft 
identification.  This unique address in each interrogation and reply also permits the inclusion 
of data link messages to or from a particular aircraft i.e. selective calling will be possible in 
addition to ‘All Call’ messages.
Improved Integrity of Surveillance Data
The superior resolution ability of Mode S plus selective interrogation will:
•	 eliminate synchronous garble.
•	 resolve the effects of over interrogation.
•	 simplify aircraft identification in the case of radar reflections.
Improved Air Picture Tracking and Situation Awareness
The radar controller will be presented with a better current air picture and improved horizontal 
and vertical tracking due to unambiguous aircraft identification, enhanced tracking techniques 
and the increased downlink data from the aircraft.
Alleviation of Modes A/C Code Shortage
The current shortage of SSR codes in the EUR region will be eliminated by the unique aircraft 
address ability of Mode S.
Reduction of R/T Workload
Due to the progressive introduction of Mode S, R/T between a controller and an aircraft will be 
reduced; e.g. code verification procedures will not be required.
Improvements to Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA)
The ability of Mode S to eliminate synchronous garbling, to produce a more stable speed 
vector and to acquire aircraft altitude reporting in 25 ft increments (if supported by compatible 
barometric avionics) will improve safety.  In addition, access to the downlinked aircraft’s vertical 
rate will produce early, accurate knowledge of aircraft manoeuvres.
Note:   Whilst the ground system will benefit from altitude reporting in 25 ft intervals there is 
no intention to change the existing practice of displaying altitude information to the 
controller in 100 ft increments.

Levels of Mode S Transponders
ICAO Aeronautical Telecommunications, Vol. IV, Annex 10 stipulates that Mode S transponders 
shall conform to one of four levels of capability:
Level 1	 	
This is the basic transponder and permits surveillance based on Mode A/C as 
well as on Mode S.  With a Mode S aircraft address it comprises the minimum 
features for compatible operation with Mode S interrogators. It has no data 
link capability and will not be used by international air traffic.
Level 2		
This has the same capabilities as Level 1 and permits standard length data link 
communication from ground to air and air to ground. It includes automatic 
aircraft identification reporting. This is the minimum level permitted for 
international flights.
Level 3		
This has the same capabilities as Level 2 but permits extended data link 
communications from the ground to the aircraft.
Level 4 	
This has the same capabilities as Level 3 but allows extended data link 
communications from the aircraft to the ground.

Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)
Introduction
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) is a secondary radar system that enables an aircraft to 
establish its range from a ground station. A pilot obtains accurate magnetic bearings from a 
VHF Omni-range (VOR) beacon and accurate slant ranges from a DME. The two facilities are 
normally co-sited to form the standard ICAO approved RHO-THETA short range, “Line of Sight” 
navigation aid. (Rho = range; Theta = bearing)

Frequencies
Channels
DME (emission code P0N) is a secondary radar system operating between 960 and 1215 MHz 
in the UHF band at 1 MHz spacing; this provides 252 spot frequencies or channels.
There is always a difference of +/- 63 MHz between the interrogation and transponding 
frequencies. The channels are numbered 1 to 126X and 1 to 126Y. A channel number is selected 
by the pilot of a TACAN (TACtical Air Navigation) equipped military aircraft; this equipment 
provides the pilot with range and bearing. Civil aircraft have the cheaper VOR/DME equipment 
and select the appropriate paired VHF frequency to obtain range from either a DME or military 
TACAN facility.

DME Paired With ILS Localizer Transmitter
DME is also frequency paired with the ILS localizer frequencies.  These DME supplement or 
replace the range information provided by the Marker Beacons. The range information is zero 
referenced to the ILS runway threshold. DME is obtained by selecting the ILS frequency.
Uses of DME
A DME:
•	 provides very accurate slant range, a circular position line and in conjunction with another 
DME, or a co-sited VOR, two position line fixes.
•	 integrates the change of slant range into groundspeed and elapsed times when the 
aircraft is fitted with an appropriate computer.
•	 permits more accurate flying of holding patterns and DME arcs.
•	 provides range and height checks when flying non-precision approach procedures, e.g. 
locator only and VOR let-downs.
•	 indicates accurate ranges to the runway threshold, and heights for range, when flying an 
ILS/DME procedure.
•	 facilitates radar identification when the pilot reports his VOR/DME position.
•	 facilitates the separation and control of aircraft in non-radar airspace, based upon a VOR/
DME fix reported by individual aircraft.
•	 is the basis for a simple Area Navigation (RNAV) system when the appropriate 
computerization is fitted.
•	 provides accurate range inputs into the more complex and accurate RNAV systems; twin, 
self-selecting DME/DME are used.

Pulse Technique
DME is a secondary radar system providing slant range by pulse technique.
The aircraft’s interrogator transmits a stream of omni-directional pulses on the carrier frequency 
of the ground transponder. Simultaneously the interrogator’s receiver starts a Range Search. 
At the transponder on the ground the received interrogation pulses are re-transmitted, after a 
delay of 50 µs, at a frequency that is +/- 63 MHz removed from the interrogation frequency.
The airborne system identifies its own unique stream of pulses and measures the time interval, 
electronically, between the start of the interrogation and the reception of the response from 
the transponder. The time measurement, and hence range, is very accurate and is based upon 
the speed of radio waves i.e. 3 × 108 m/s. A modern DME is inherently accurate to +/- 0.2 NM
In theory up to 100 aircraft can interrogate a DME transponder. Thus each aircraft is receiving 
its own returning paired pulses plus those which result from other aircrafts’ interrogations, as 
the pulses have the same carrier frequency.
The width of the interrogation pulses is 3.5 µs (1050 m) and they are transmitted in pairs; (the 
interval between the individual pulses of a pair is 12 µs for X channel and 36 µs for Y channel).

Aircraft Range Determination
Figure 15.7 The Principle of Range Measurement
For an individual aircraft to achieve an unambiguous slant range measurement and overcome 
the problem of identification:
•	 Each aircraft’s interrogator is programmed to transmit its paired pulses at random intervals 
i.e. the transmission sequence of pulses is irregular or jittered. This differentiates its pulses 
from all the others.
•	 At the instant of transmission, the receiver of an interrogator sets up gates to match the 
random PRF of the transmitted twin pulses.
•	 The responses on the transponder’s carrier frequency include an individual aircraft’s paired 
pulses plus those from other aircraft.
•	 The receiving equipment of an aircraft is designed so that only the responses which match 
its randomized PRF are allowed through the gates. The pulses have now achieved lock-on 
i.e. the DME enters the tracking mode.
•	 As the aircraft’s range from the station increases or decreases (unless the aircraft is circling) 
the gates move to accommodate the corresponding increase or decrease in the time between 
transmission and reception of the twin pulses. This lock-and-follow technique ensures that 
the returning twin pulses are continuously tracked.
•	 The off-set in time between transmission and reception is the measure of the aircraft’s slant 
range from the DME transponder.

Figure 15.8 Acceptance of Own Pulses
Twin Pulses
The use by the DME system of twin pulses ensures that the receivers never accept matching 
randomized single pulses which could (possibly) emanate from, for example, other radars, 
ignition systems or lightning.
Range Search
To achieve a rapid lock-on during the range search, the DME interrogator transmits at 150 
pulse pairs per second (ppps) for 15 000 pulse pairs (100 seconds).
If lock-on is not achieved, it will then reduce the rate to 60 ppps and maintains this rate until 
there is a range lock-on. At lock-on the system operates at a random PRF of 27 ppps.
During the range search the range counters, or pointer, of the indicator rotate rapidly from zero 
nautical miles through to the maximum range; this takes 4 to 5 seconds in modern equipment 
and 25 to 30 in older systems. If no response is achieved within this period, the pointer, or 
counters, return rapidly to zero and the search starts again.
Beacon Saturation
The output of a modern ground beacon is a constant 2700 pulse pairs per second which, in 
the absence of any aircraft interrogations, are generated at random intervals. When a ground 
beacon is receiving 2700 ppps it becomes saturated and it then reduces its receiver gain. 
The effect of this is to exclude the transmissions from aircraft whose interrogation pulses are 
weaker. This equates to about 100 aircraft using the DME at the same time.

Figure 15.9 Beacon Saturation
In Figure 15.9 all aircraft A to G are receiving ranges from the transponder with aircraft B just 
entering the coverage. When the transponder becomes saturated, the receiver gain is reduced 
and aircraft A, B, E, F and G will be excluded and unlock.  The aim is to give preference to the 
nearest aircraft as the beacon responds to the strongest interrogations.
Station Identification
A 3 letter call sign is transmitted every 30 seconds, usually in conjunction with an associated 
VOR. During the ident period the random pulses are replaced by regularly spaced pulses keyed 
with the station identification letters. This means that range information is not available 
during the ident period. However the aircraft equipment has a 10 second memory circuit to 
continue displaying the range obtained. The DME identification is distinguished from the VOR 
identification by having a different tone (usually higher than the VOR).
VOR/DME Frequency Pairing
To facilitate and speed up frequency selection, and to reduce the pilot’s cockpit workload, 
VORs may be frequency paired with a DME or a military TACAN installation. This means that the 
aircraft’s DME circuits are automatically activated when the appropriate VHF VOR frequency 
is selected. Ideally the VOR and DME or TACAN beacons should be co-sited in order that a 
range and bearing can be plotted from the same source. This is not always possible. The table 
explains the siting and frequency pairing and call sign arrangements of VOR/DME or VOR/
TACAN facilities.

DME Range Measurement for ILS
When DME is paired with ILS, the transponder is adjusted to give range to the threshold in UK 
systems, since clearly the ground installation cannot be placed at the threshold. This is achieved 
by reducing the time delay at the transponder, so that the time taken for the interrogation 
signal to travel from the runway threshold to the transponder, plus the delay at the transponder, 
plus the time taken for the reply to travel from the transponder to the runway threshold is 50 
microseconds.
For example: if the transponder is 1500 m from the runway threshold, the time for the 
interrogation and reply pulses to travel between the threshold and transponder will be 5 
microseconds each way, so the delay at the transponder must be reduced to 40 microseconds 
to give a range to the threshold.
Range and Coverage
DME transmissions obey the ‘line of sight’ rule. Thus the higher the aircraft, and the ground 
beacon, the greater the theoretical reception distance.
Intervening high ground will block the line of sight range.
The effect of bank angle is to hide the aircraft antenna from the transponder on the ground 
and will cause an interruption in the flow of signals. However, the memory circuit ensures that 
there is no major disruption to range measurement.
In order to overcome range errors which may be caused by mutual interference between two or 
more facilities sharing the same frequencies, a Designated Operational Coverage is published 
for each DME; this protects a DME from co-channel interference under normal propagation 
conditions. The DOC is specified as a range and height. The use of a DME beyond its DOC 
limitations may result in range errors.
In order to eliminate errors arising from reflections from the earth’s surface, buildings or 
mountainous terrain, the aircraft receiver incorporates an Echo Protection Circuit.

Accuracy
System Accuracy
Based on a 95% probability the system accuracy for DME used for navigation (DME/N) should 
give a total system error not exceeding +/- 0.25 NM +/-1.25% of range. Precision systems 
(DME/P) are accurate to  +/- 100 ft on Final Approach.
The total system limits include errors from causes such as those arising from airborne equipment, 
ground equipment, propagation and random pulse interference effects.
Slant Range / Ground Range Accuracy
The difference between computed slant range and actual ground distance increases the higher 
and closer an aircraft gets in relation to the DME. As a general rule the difference becomes 
significant when the aircraft is at a range which is less than 3 × height. When the aircraft is 
directly over the DME (0 NM ground distance), it will indicate the aircraft’s height in nautical 
miles. There is a small cone of confusion over a DME, plus range indications continue to be 
computed as the equipment has a 10 second memory circuit.

Accuracy of Ground Speed Computation
The equipment’s indicated ground speed, 
which is computed from the rate of change 
of slant range, becomes more inaccurate and 
under-reads the actual ground speed, the 
closer and higher an aircraft is in relation to 
the DME beacon.
An aircraft circling a DME beacon at a constant 
range will have an indicated computed ground 
speed of zero knots. A ground speed is only valid when an aircraft is homing to, or flying 
directly away from, a VOR/ DME - TACAN.

Area Navigation Systems (RNAV)
Introduction
RNAV is defined as a method of navigation which permits aircraft operations on any desired 
track within the coverage of station-referenced navigation signal, or within the limits of self-
contained navigation system.
An area navigation (RNAV) system is any system that allows the aircraft to be navigated to the 
required level of accuracy without the requirement to fly directly over ground based facilities.
The required accuracy is achieved by using some, or all, of the following inputs of information:
•	 VOR/DME
•	 ILS/MLS
•	 GNSS
•	 INS/IRS
•	 ADC
•	 Time
The information is processed within the system to give the most accurate and continuously 
updated position and the necessary outputs to provide the pilot with course, ETA etc.
Benefits of RNAV
RNAV allows aircraft to take a more direct flight path appropriate to the route they are 
flying thereby improving the operating efficiency and helping in relieving congestion on the 
overcrowded airway system. To facilitate this, air traffic control centres have established RNAV 
routes which are more direct than the traditional airways system allows and do not require 
aircraft to regularly fly to the overhead of beacons. Hence the benefits are:
•	 A reduction in distance, flight time and fuel (and hence costs) by giving airlines and pilots 
greater flexibility and choice of routes.
•	 An increase in the present route capacity by making full use of the available airspace by 
providing more direct routes, parallel or dual routes and bypass routes for overflying aircraft 
in high density terminal areas.
•	 A reduction in vertical and horizontal separation criteria.
Types and Levels of RNAV
There are two types of RNAV:
Basic RNAV (B-RNAV) which is required to give a position accuracy to within 5 NM on at least 
95% of occasions.  It is now mandatory for all aircraft carrying 30 passengers or more to have 
B-RNAV capability within Euro-control airspace.
Precision RNAV (P-RNAV) must be accurate to within 1.0 NM on at least 95% of occasions. 
P-RNAV routes are now being established in terminal airspace.

There are three levels of RNAV capability:
•	 2D RNAV which relates to the capabilities in the horizontal plane only.
•	 3D RNAV indicates the addition of a guidance capability in the vertical plane.
•	 4D RNAV indicates the addition to 3D RNAV of a timing function.

•	 Control and Display Unit (CDU).
•	 Indicator in the form of a:

Area Navigation Systems (RNAV)
Operation of a Simple 2D RNAV System
A simple RNAV system uses rho/theta (range/bearing) to define position, which is derived 
from range and bearing information from VOR/DME stations. The pilot defines waypoints 
along the route to be flown as range and bearing from suitably located VOR/DME. Then the 
equipment, using the VOR/DME bearing and range, computes the QDM and distance to the 
waypoint and presents the information to the pilot on a CDI or HSI as if the waypoint itself is a 
VOR/DME station, hence these waypoints are known as phantom stations.

Figure 16.2 An RNAV route & waypoints
In the diagram the pilot has defined waypoints along the planned route from SND to NEW 
using available and sensibly placed VOR/DME.
Waypoints may be selected and programmed for:
•	 En route navigation.
•	 Initial approach fixes.
•	 Locator Outer Markers.
•	 ILS frequencies (when selected the instrumentation automatically reverts to ILS mode).
The following table shows the inputs that would be required for the above RNAV route.

Principle of Operation of a Simple 2D RNAV System
Refer to Figure 16.3. The aircraft is flying from waypoint 1 (WP1) defined by DTY VOR/DME to 
waypoint 2 (WP2) defined by POL VOR/DME. As the aircraft arrives at WP1, POL is selected and 
the range and bearing measured (145(M)/104 NM). The RNAV knows its position with respect 
to POL and the pilot has already input waypoint 2 with respect to POL. The computer can now 
compute the track and distance from WP1 to WP2 (340(M)/102 NM) since it has two sides, the 
included angle and the orientation of magnetic north. The RNAV now continually computes 
the aircraft position with respect to POL and compares this position with the computed track 
to determine the cross-track error and the distance to go. Steering demands are fed to a CDI 
or HSI for the pilot to keep the aircraft on track and give continuous range read-out to WP2. It 
should be noted that on such a system the indications of deviation from track are in NM.

Limitations and Accuracy of Simple RNAV Systems
The beacons are selected by the pilot during the pre-flight planning and the pilot must ensure 
that each waypoint is within DOC of the VOR/DME designating that waypoint and of the VOR/
DME designating the next waypoint.
Slant range error in DME must be considered in selecting facilities close to track.
The pilot must ensure that the information is correctly input into the CDU because the computer 
cannot recognize or rectify mistakes.
To avoid positional errors the aircraft must at all times be within the DOC of the in use facility. 
The accuracy of the fixing information is dependent on range and whether the VOR or DME 
element is predominant. If the VOR/DME is close to the planned track to/from the waypoint, 
the along track element will be most accurate. If the VOR/DME designating the way point is 
perpendicular to the track, the across track will be most accurate.

The 737-800 FMS
The 737-800 FMS comprises:
•	 Flight Management Computer System (FMCS) 
•	 Autopilot/Flight Director System (AFDS)
•	 Autothrottle (A/T)
•	 2 Inertial Reference Systems (IRS)
Each component is an independent system which may be used individually or in various 
combinations. The term FMS implies the joining of all these systems into one integrated system 
which provides automatic navigation, guidance and performance management. The FMS 
provides 4D area navigation (latitude, longitude, altitude and time) and optimizes peformance 
to achieve the most economical flight possible. It provides centralized cockpit control of the 
aircraft’s flight path and performance parameters.
The Flight Management Computer (FMC) is the heart of the system, performing all the 
navigational and performance calculations and providing control and guidance commands. 
A control and display unit (CDU) allows the crew to input the flight details and performance 
parameters into the FMC. The navigation and performance computations are displayed on the 
CDU for reference and monitoring. The related FMC commands for lateral (LNAV) and vertical 
(VNAV) navigation may be coupled to the AFDS and A/T.
In the navigation functions the FMC receives inputs of position and heading from the IRS and 
fixing information using twin DME. The FMC compares these inputs and by a process known 
as Kalman filtering produces a system position. In the operation with radio position updating, 
the FMC is combining the short term accuracy of the IRS with the long term accuracy of the 
external reference. If the FMS is using just the IRS information to derive position a warning is 
displayed to the crew indicating that the positional information is downgraded.
The crew may select the level of automation required, from simply using the data displays 
to fly the aircraft manually, e.g. for heading or TAS/Mach No., to fully automatic flight path 
guidance and performance control (see Figure 16.5).
Even with full FMS operation, the crew have absolute control of the management and operation 
of the aircraft. Furthermore, certain functions can only be implemented by the crew, e.g. thrust 
initiation, take-off, altitude selection, ILS tuning, aircraft configuration and landing rollout. The 
crew should always monitor the FMC navigation throughout the flight to ensure the flight plan 
is being accurately followed by the automatic systems.

The FMC contains a performance database and a navigation database. The performance 
database contains all parameters of the aircraft performance and the company’s cost index 
strategy. The navigation database contains aeronautical information for the planned area of 
operations of the aircraft, comprising:
•	 aerodrome details, positions, elevations, runways and lengths etc.
•	 navigation facilities, including location, altitude, frequency, identification and DOC.
•	 airways routes, including reporting points.
•	 SIDs and STARs and runway approaches.
•	 company routes.
The navigation data is updated every 28 days and the FMC contains the current and next 28 
days database (this coincides with the ICAO navigation data cycle). The data may be customized 
for the specific airline operations.

In addition to the alphanumeric keypad and the specific function keys, alongside the display 
are line select keys (LSK) which are used for inserting or selecting data into the FMC and 
moving through the various function pages. The format of the display is; in the top field the 
title of the selected page and, where the selected function has more than one page, the page 
number (e.g. 1 of 3). In the centre of the display are up to 10 data fields, 5 on the left and right 
respectively which are accessed using the LSKs. At the bottom of the screen are two or more 
page select fields and below them the scratchpad. The scratchpad is used to input or modify 
data for insertion into the appropriate data field.
Pre-flight
The pre-flight initialization of the FMC in the navigation mode requires the pilot to check the 
validity of the database and input:
•	 check the correct database installed - IDENT.
•	 the aircraft position - POS INIT.
•	 departure and destination aerodromes.
•	 intended SID and STAR procedures. 
•	 the planned route - POS INIT.

If the aircraft is flying a standard company route then the route designator is inserted, otherwise 
the pilot will have to input the route manually. Data is initially typed into the scratchpad at the 
bottom of the screen then inserted in the appropriate position using the line selection keys. 
Once a valid position has been input it is passed to the IRS.

When power is applied, the FMS executes an internal test sequence. When the test is successfully 
completed, it presents the IDENT page on the CDU. This page contains information on the 
aircraft model and engine thrust from the performance database at 1L and 1R, the identification 
of the permanent navigation database at 2L with 2R and 3R showing the currency periods of 
the navigation data in the database. At 4L is the identification of the operating programme 
and at 5R is the date of the supplementary data. The only information that can be changed 
on this display is the current nav data at 2R. If this is out of date a prompt will appear in the 
scratchpad. To change the data, select LSK 3R to downselect the next period of data to the 
scratchpad, then 2R to insert the data into the active data line. Note that at 6R is the prompt 
for the next page in the initialization sequence and at 6L is the prompt for the page index. 
Where any input data is used on other CDU pages the data will automatically ‘propagate’ to 
those pages.

The position initialization (POS INIT) page allows initialization of heading and position for the 
IRS. On all displays the dashed lines, as at 5R, indicate where optional data may be inserted to 
assist the FMC operation. The boxed areas at 4R indicate where data essential to the operation 
of the FMC must be inserted. The last position recorded before shutdown is displayed at 
1R. The departure airport is inserted at 2L and the gate at 3L. The FMC extracts the airfield 
reference and gate positions from the database and inserts them at 2R and 3R respectively. 
At 4R the FMC is asking for the aircraft position to initialize the IRS. The position could be 
input manually in the scratchpad then inserted by selecting LSK 4R. However, the database 
has already inserted the position into 3R, so this can be copied by selecting 3R to draw the 
data down to the scratchpad and then 4R to insert into the field. To speed up alignment, 
particularly if the aircraft has been moved, the magnetic heading from the standby compass 
can be input at 5R. Having completed this, the alignment of the IRS will now proceed. The 
prompt at 6R now directs the pilot to the route (RTE) page.

The departure and destination aerodromes are input to 1L and 1R respectively. Valid data is 
any ICAO aerodrome designator held in the database. If the ICAO identifier was input on the 
POS INIT, then it will appear at 1L. The company route is inserted at 2L and the flight number 
at 2R. The runway in use and the SID and first route waypoint are inserted at 3L and 4L. Note 
this will automatically appear if they are defined in the company route. The information at 
5L (airway) and 5R (next reporting point on airway V2) is inserted by the computer from the 
database. To access the subsequent pages of the RTE, select the NEXT PAGE function key on 
the keyboard to check or modify the route. The 6R prompt directs the pilot to activate the 
route. Pressing 6R will illuminate the EXEC key on the CDU which should in turn be pressed for 
the computer to action the route after take-off. After take-off the RUNWAY line is cleared and 
the VIA/TO moves up to line 3 and the next waypoint appears at 4. As an active waypoint is 
passed, line three is cleared and replaced with the next active waypoint.
The pre-flight actions for the navigation profile are now complete, but the performance 
initialization is yet to be actioned. This is dealt with elsewhere in the course. The computer will 
check the conditions against the performance data and the required cost index profile and 
inform the pilots of the power, speed and configuration to achieve the required profile. If a 
manual input of a route is required, this can be achieved through the scratchpad, as can any 
modifications to the standard company routes. 
The valid formats for navigational inputs are:
Latitude and Longitude as either a 7 group alphanumeric (e.g. N05W010) or a 15 group (e.g. 
N0926.3W00504.7). Note the leading zeros must be entered for the FMC to accept the position.
Up to 5 alphanumerics for ICAO aerodrome designators, reporting points, navigation facilities, 
airways designators (e.g. EGLL, KODAP, DHD, A23) and runway designators.

Range and bearing from a navigational aid or reporting point (e.g. TRN250.0/76). Note the 
decimals are optional, the bearing must always be a 3 or 5 digit group, the distance may be 1 
to 5 digits. In this case the FMC would give the position the designation TRN01, assuming it was 
the first or only position specified with reference to TRN. These are known as place bearing/
distance (PBD) waypoints.

position intersects with a course (e.g. an airway) or the bearing from another database 
defined position. The format for input is e.g. GOW167.0/TRN090.5, the FMC now produces a

On the climb page (CLB) at 1L is the planned initial cruising altitude, if one exists and the climb 
is active, and at 1R is the current climb restriction. The suffix ‘A’ indicates altitude. 2L gives 
the economy speed for the climb and 3L any speed restriction, which defaults to 250 kt and 
10 000 ft. Any other speed/altitude restriction imposed by ATC can be input to 3L from the 
scratchpad. At 2R is the ETA and distance to go to the next position. 3R gives the height error 
at the next point showing the aircraft will be 310 ft low. The climb engine N1 is displayed at 
4R. The prompts at 5 and 6 L and R direct the pilots to the other climb mode pages. (RTA is 
required time of arrival, to be used if an RTA is specified by ATC).

The cruise page (CRZ) has the current cruising altitude at 1L with the required cruising speed at 
2L; in this case the economy cruise speed. At 3L is the computed EPR/N1 required to maintain 
the speed at 2L, with the predicted destination fuel shown at 4L. At 1C is the optimum and 
maximum cruising level for the aircraft weight and the ambient conditions. The next step 
altitude is displayed at 1R with the time and distance to make the step climb at 2R. 3R shows 
the estimated wind velocity and 4R shows the predicted savings or penalty in making the step

Figure 16.14 
With the active economy path descent (ACT ECON PATH DES) page selected, the target Mach 
number and CAS are at 2L; at 1L is the end of descent altitude. At 1R is the next descent position 
and altitude; the suffix A indicates at or above. Position 3L contains the speed transition, which 
is 10 kt less than that stored in the database, and the transition altitude. If none is defined 
then it defaults to 240/10000. No input is permitted to this field, but the data can be removed. 
The next waypoint and altitude is shown at 3R, with the expected deviation from this required 
height displayed at 4L. At 4R FPA is actual flight path angle based on current ground speed and 
rate of descent. V/B is the vertical bearing i.e. the FPA required to achieve the required height 
at the next position, and V/S is the actual rate of descent. Access to associated descent pages 
is gained at 5R, 6L and 6R.
Principle Of Operation - Twin IRS, Twin FMC
In a twin IRS system the left FMC will normally receive information from the left IRS and the 
right FMC from the right IRS. The systems compare the IRS positions but if there is a discrepancy, 
they cannot determine in isolation which system is in error. The FMC must have the input of 
an external reference in order to determine the correct position. Using Kalman filtering, the 
external reference is compared with the IRS positions to determine the system position. At the 
start of a flight the IRS position will predominate but as the flight progresses, the IRS positions 
will degrade and the weighting for the external reference will increase, commensurate with 
the selection of external reference, and the range from that reference.
There are four possible modes of operation of a twin FMS system. In the dual mode, one FMC 
acts as the master and the other as the slave. The systems independently determine position 
and the positional information is co-related, to check for gross errors, before being passed to 
the EFIS. This means that the position presented on the EFIS may differ from that on each CDU. 
With independent operation, each FMC works in isolation with no communication.
--- Page 284 ---
Area Navigation Systems (RNAV)
16
278
16
Area Navigation Systems (RNAV)
The information from one of the FMCs will be used to feed the other systems and there will 
be a difference in position between the two FMCs and between the EFIS and the non-selected 
FMC. If one FMC is inoperative then the functions can be carried out by the serviceable FMC. 
If both FMCs are inoperative then IRS information will be used directly in the EFIS but the 
automatic performance functions will not be available.
Principle Of Operation - Triple IRS, Twin FMC
Positional information and heading from the triple INS/IRS is fed into the FMC where the 
information is compared to check for any system having gross errors and then averaged. 
This position may then be compared with an external reference which may be DME/DME, 
VOR/DME or GNSS. The FMC uses Kalman filtering to produce position and velocity. This 
filtering may be done purely using the IRS information or using a combination of IRS and 
external reference.
When operating at latitudes in excess of 84° the FMC will de-couple the IRS with the left FMC 
using the IRS in the order left, centre, right and the right FMC in the order right, centre, left. 
Over a short period of time each FMC will change the FMC position to the appropriate IRS 
position. The reason for the de-coupling is that the calculation of change of longitude from 
departure is a function of the secant of latitude, which, at values approaching 90°, is increasing 
rapidly (e.g. sec 86°00 = 14.3356, sec 86°01’ = 14.3955). This means that a small error in latitude 
will result in a large error in the calculation of change of longitude. This would give an apparent 
large divergence between the IRS positions in terms of the longitude calculated, although in 
fact the actual difference in position would be small.
Kalman Filtering
Kalman filtering is the process used within a navigation computer to combine the short term 
accuracy of the IRS with the long term accuracy of the external reference. The model assesses 
the velocity and position errors from the IRS by comparing the IRS position with the external 
reference to produce its own prediction of position and velocity. Initially the IRS information 
will be the most accurate, but as the ramp effect of IRS errors progresses, the external 
reference information will become the most accurate. The weighting system applied within 
the model will initially favour the IRS information but as a flight progresses it will become more 
biased towards the external reference. Consequently the position will be most accurate after 
the position update on the runway threshold but will gradually decay to the accuracy of the 
external reference. The position information will again improve when the aircraft is on final 
approach using a precision system (ILS or MLS). The more complex the model used (i.e. the 
more factors are included) the better will be the quality of the system position and velocity.
DME - IRS Accuracy
The position accuracy of the IRS continually degrades throughout the flight, although the 
heading and ground speed maintain a high degree of accuracy. The measurement of position 
is subject to random errors which are dependent on the range and the cut of the position lines. 
The second problem is solved by the computer selecting DMEs positioned so that a good cut 
will be obtained. Slant range error is compensated for in the calculation, but the DME error is 
constant at +/-0.25 NM +/-1.25% of range, so at 100 NM the error will a maximum of 1.5 NM. 
At the start of a flight this error will be large compared with the IRS error, but as the flight 
progresses the IRS is degrading at around 1 NM/h. After several hours, since the DME error is 
constant, the DME fixing will be significantly more accurate than the IRS.

Electronic Flight Information System (EFIS)
Introduction
(EASA CS-25) AMJ 25-11, contains the advisory material for manufacturers to observe when 
designing electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI) displays. It specifies the colour coding 
to be used, and the requirement on manufacturers to ensure there can be no confusion 
between colours or symbols. It also defines the probabilities that essential information (e.g. 
attitude, altitude, heading etc.) will not be lost or inaccurately displayed.
Detailed knowledge of the EASA CS-25 specifications is not required for the examination. Such 
knowledge as is needed has been reproduced in this chapter.
EHSI Controller
The EHSI displays navigational information, radar information and TCAS information. For the 
Radio Navigation examination knowledge of, and the ability to interpret, the navigational 
information is essential.
The inputs to the EHSI are from:
•	 IRS
•	 FMC
•	 VOR, DME, ILS, and ADF
•	 TCAS
•	 AWR
The information from all of the inputs is fed to the port and starboard EHSI, through the 
respective symbol generators, which are the heart of the EFIS. They process the various inputs 
to generate the correct symbology for the EHSI.
The EHSI controller has a function switch to select the mode of the displays, a range selection 
switch and 6 switches to control the display of data.

The display modes available are:
•	 Full (or full rose) VOR/ILS.
•	 Expanded VOR/ILS.
•	 MAP.
•	 PLAN.
Weather radar and TCAS information can only be displayed on the expanded VOR/ILS and 
MAP displays. The selectable map background options are enabled in the Map and Plan modes. 
The information available for display is:
•	 Tuned VOR/ADF radials (VOR/ADF).
•	 Navigation Aids (NAV AID).
•	 Airports (ARPT).
•	 Route Data (RTE DATA). 
•	 Waypoints (WPT). 
•	 Weather (WXR).
The traffic switch in the centre of the range selection knob when pressed will either:
•	 Display TCAS information, if not already displayed.
•	 Remove TCAS information from the display.
•	 When TCAS FAIL is displayed; remove the message.
With the exception of the PLAN mode which is orientated to true north, all the displays are 
orientated to aircraft heading which may be either magnetic or true. Range arcs (white) are 
displayed in the expanded VOR and ILS modes when the WXR switch is on, and in the MAP 
mode at all times.

Figure 17.2 Expanded VOR mode
The display shows that VOR2 is in use on a frequency of 116.80 MHz, the aircraft is outbound 
from the beacon at a range of 13.3 NM (DME) and is 7.5° right of the required track (165°(M)). 
The heading is 130°(M) and the present track 133°(M). The pilot has selected the heading bug 
to 104°(M). WXR is selected and the radar is in WX+T mode with 12° uptilt and the display is 
showing a contouring cloud centred on 105°(M) between 8 and 17 NM. The selected scale is 20 
NM and the wind is 126°(M)/20 kt.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
Introduction
The development of space based navigation systems commenced in the 1950s with the 
establishment of the USA Transit system. The current generation began development in the 
1970’s and the next generation is already under development. It is intended that GNSS will 
eventually replace all terrestrial radio navigation facilities. However, despite USA assertions 
that this is imminent, it is unlikely to be achieved in the foreseeable future.
The current systems have brought a new dimension of accuracy to navigation systems with 
precision measured in metres, and where special differential techniques are used the potential 
is for accuracies substantially less than one metre.
At present there are two operational global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), enhancements 
of the existing systems under development and a planned European system. These systems are:
The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) operated by the USA.
The Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) operated by Russia. After 
serious problems following the disintegration of the USSR in 1989/1990 the system is now fully 
operational.
Local area differential GNSS (LADGNSS) to provide improved accuracy and integrity to aircraft 
making airfield approaches.
Wide area differential GNSS (WADGNSS) of which the European Geostationary Navigation 
Overlay System (EGNOS) is the European contribution to a global augmentation system 
providing integrity and improved accuracy.
The European Galileo, which is under development and intended to provide a limited service 
from 2014/2015 and be fully operational by 2020. The principal reason the Europeans are 
developing their own system is one of internal security, since access to the full GPS or GLONASS 
facilities is outside European control. China is also developing its own system known as Compass 
or Beidou 2.  The system is expected to be fully operational by 2020.
This chapter will study GPS, LADGNSS and EGNOS in detail, but it should be borne in mind that 
GLONASS and Galileo operate on similar principles to GPS, although there are differences in 
implementation.
Satellite Orbits
Johannes Kepler’s laws quantified the mathematics of planetry orbits which apply equally to 
the orbits of satellites:
Using these laws, and given a starting point, the satellites - space vehicles (SVs) calculate their 
positions at all points in their orbits. The SVs’ orbital position is known as ephemeris.

Position Reference System
GNSS use an earth referenced three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with its origin at 
the centre of the earth.

Figure 18.2 
Because the systems are global, a common model of the earth was required. The World 
Geodetic Survey of 1984 (WGS84) was selected as the appropriate model for GPS and all GPS 
terrestrial positions are defined on this model and referenced to the Cartesian coordinate 
system. Where other models are required, for instance for the UK’s Ordnance Survey maps, a 
mathematical transformation is available between the models (note this is incorporated as a 
feature of GPS receivers available in the UK). Galileo uses the European Terrestrial Reference 
System 1989 (ETRS89) and the Russian model for GLONASS is known as Parameters of the 
Earth 1990 (PZ90). WGS84 is the ICAO standard for aeronautical positions, however, since all 
these systems are mathematical models, transposition from ETRS89 to WGS84, for example, is 
a relatively simple mathematical process. Mathematically all these models are regular shapes, 
known as ellipsoids.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
The ellipsoids cannot be a perfect representation, nor can they represent geographical features, 
e.g. mountains and land depressions. The distance of mean sea level from the centre of the 
earth depends on gravitational forces which vary both locally and globally. Hence mean sea 
level will not necessarily coincide with the surface of the ellipsoid. The maximum variation 
between mean sea level and the surface of the ellipsoid for WGS84 is approximately 50 m. 
Hence the vertical information provided by any system referenced to this model cannot be 
used in isolation for vertical positioning, except when in medium/high level cruise with all 
aircraft using the GNSS reference and in LADGNSS applications - (where the vertical error is 
removed).

GPS time is measured in weeks and seconds from 00:00:00 on 06 January 1980 UTC. An epoch 
is 1024 weeks after which the time restarts at zero. GPS time is referenced to UTC but does not 
run in direct synchronization, so time correlation information is included in the SV broadcast. 
In July 2000 the difference was about 13 seconds.

The Space Segment
The operational constellation for GPS is specified as comprising 24 SVs.  (Currently the USA 
has 31 SVs providing a navigational service). The orbits have an average height of 10 898 NM 
(20 180 km) and have an orbital period of 12 hours. The orbital planes have an inclination of 
55° and are equally spaced around the equator. The spacing of the SVs in their orbits is such 
that an observer on or close to the surface of the earth will have between five and eight SVs in 
view, at least 5° above the horizon. The SVs have 3 or 4 atomic clocks of caesium or rubidium 
standard with an accuracy of 1 nanosecond.
An SV will be masked (that is not selected for navigation use) if its elevation is less than 5° 
above the horizon.
Figure 18.4 The GPS Satellite Constellation
The SVs broadcast pseudo-random noise (PRN) codes of one millisecond duration on two 
frequencies in the UHF band and a NAV and SYSTEM data message. Each SV has its own unique 
code.
L1 Frequency: 1575.42 MHz transmits the coarse acquisition (C/A) code repeated every 
millisecond with a modulation of 1.023 MHz, the precision (P) code, modulation 10.23 MHz 
repeats every seven days and the navigation and system data message at 50 Hz. The navigation 
and system data message is used by both the P and C/A codes.
L2 Frequency: 1227.6 MHz transmitting the P code. The second frequency is used to determine 
ionospheric delays.
L3 Frequency: 1381.05 MHz has been allocated as a second frequency for non-authorized users 
and its use is the same as the L2 frequency.

Only the C/A code is available to civilian users. The reason the use of two frequencies is important 
will be discussed in GNSS errors. The P code is provided for the US military and approved civilian 
users and foreign military users at the discretion of the US DOD. The P code is designated as the 
Y code when anti-spoofing measures are implemented. The Y code is encrypted and therefore 
only available to users with the necessary decryption algorithms.
The PRN codes provide SV identification and a timing function for the receiver to measure SV 
range.
The information contained in the nav and system data message is:
•	 SV position
•	 SV clock time
•	 SV clock error
•	 Information on ionospheric conditions
•	 Supplementary information, including the almanac (orbital parameters for the SVs), SV 
health (P-code only), correlation of GPS time with UTC and other command and control 
functions.
The two services provided are:
•	 The standard positioning service (SPS) using the C/A code
•	 The precise positioning service (PPS) using the C/A and P codes
GLONASS also has an operational constellation of 24 SVs positioned in three orbital planes 
inclined at 65° to the equator. The orbital height is 10 313 NM (19 099 km) giving an orbital 
period of 11 hours 15 minutes. As in GPS, GLONASS transmits C/A and P codes. The codes are 
the same for all SVs, but each SV uses different frequencies. The L1 frequency is incremental 
from 1602 MHz and the L2 frequency from 1246 MHz.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
The monitoring stations check the SVs’ internally computed position and clock time at least 
once every 12 hours. Although the calculation of position using Keplerian laws is precise, the 
SV orbits are affected by the gravitational influences of the sun, moon and planets and are also 
affected by solar radiation, so errors between the computed position and the actual position 
occur. When a positional error is detected by the ground station, it is sent to the SV for the SV 
to update its knowledge of position. Similarly if an error is detected in the SV clock time this 
is notified to the SV, but since the clocks cannot be adjusted, this error is included in the SV 
broadcast.
The User Segment
The User Segment is all the GPS receivers using the space segment to determine position on and 
close to the surface of the earth. These receivers may be stand-alone or be part of integrated 
systems.
There are several types of receiver:
Sequential receivers which use one or two channels and scan the SVs sequentially to determine 
the pseudo-ranges.
Multiplex receivers may be single or twin channel and are able to move quickly between SVs 
to determine the pseudo-ranges and hence have a faster time to first fix than the sequential 
receivers.
Multi-channel receivers monitor several SVs simultaneously to give instant positional 
information. These include ‘all-in-view’ receivers which monitor all the SVs in view and select 
the best 4 to determine position. Because of the speed of operation these are the preferred 
type for aviation.

Principle Of Operation
The navigation message is contained in one frame comprising 5 sub-frames. The sub-frames 
each take 6 seconds to transmit, so the total frame takes 30 seconds for the receiver to receive. 
Frame 1 contains SV clock error, frames 2 and 3 contain the SV ephemeris data, frame 4 
contains data on the ionospheric propagation model, GPS time and its correlation with UTC. 
The fifth frame is used to transmit current SV constellation almanac data. A series of 25 frames 
is required to download the whole almanac. The almanac data is usually downloaded hourly 
and is valid from 4 hours to several months dependent on the type of receiver.

Because the orbits are mathematically defined, an almanac of their predicted positions can 
be and is maintained within the receivers. Thus, when the receiver is switched on, provided 
it knows its position and time to a reasonable degree of accuracy, it will know which SVs to 
expect and can commence position update immediately. If the almanac is corrupted, out of 
date or lost, or if receiver position or receiver clock time are significantly in error it will not find 
the expected SVs and will download the almanac from the constellation. The almanac data 
fills 25 frames so it takes 12.5 minutes to download. When the receiver position is significantly 
in error it will not detect the expected SVs. Having downloaded the almanac the receiver will 
now carry out a skysearch, this involves the receiver checking which SVs are above the horizon 
and selecting the 4 to give the most accurate fix, then commencing position fixing, this takes 
a least a further 2.5 minutes. Hence the time to first fix will be at least 15 minutes. If there are 
no problems then the first fix, on initialization, will be obtained within about 30 seconds.
The GPS receiver internally generates the PRN code and compares the relative position of the 
two codes to determine the time interval between transmission and reception.

Figure 18.13 Pseudo-Random Code Time Measurement
The initial measurement of range is known as pseudo-range because it has not yet been 
corrected for receiver clock error.
The receiver uses four SVs and constructs a three dimensional fix using the pseudo-ranges from 
the 4 SVs. Each range corresponds to a position somewhere on the surface of a sphere with a 
radius in excess of 10 900 NM.

The intersection of two range spheres will give a circular position line.
TWO MEASUREMENTS PUTS US
SOMEWHERE ON THIS CIRCLE
Figure 18.15 
The introduction of a third range sphere will produce two positions several thousand miles 
apart. One position will be on or close to the surface of the earth, the other position will be 
out in space, so it would be possible to use just three pseudo-ranges to produce a position, by 
rejecting the space position.
However, a fourth range position line is needed because of the way the receiver compensates 
for receiver time errors. The receiver has an accurate crystal oscillator to provide time. However, 
the accuracy does not compare with the accuracy of the SV clocks, so there will always be 
an error in the time measurement, and hence in the computation of range. Furthermore the 
receiver clock is deliberately kept in error by a small factor to ensure that the correction process 
can only go in one direction. This is why the initial calculated range is known as a pseudo-
range. As a result the position lines will not meet in a point but will form a ‘cocked hat’. For 
example, if the receiver clock is permanently 1 millisecond fast, then the receiver will over 
estimate each range by about 162 NM. So when the receiver sets about calculating the correct 
ranges it knows that it must reduce the pseudo-ranges.

The receiver has to correct the X, Y, Z coordinates and time to produce the fix. Since it has 
each element provided by each SV the receiver can set up 4 linear simultaneous equations each 
with 4 unknown quantities (X, Y, Z, and T) which it solves by iteration to remove the receiver 
time error, and hence, range errors. This means that the use of 4 SVs provides a 3D fix and 
an accurate time reference, i.e. a 4D fix, at the receiver. The X, Y, and Z coordinates can now 
be transposed into latitude and longitude or any other earth reference system (e.g. the UK 
Ordnance Survey grid) and altitude.
Note:   Some receivers can also produce a three dimensional position using three SVs with an 
input of altitude, the altitude simulates a fourth SV positioned at the centre of the 
earth. However the position produced will not be as accurate as the 4D fix.

GPS Errors
All errors are at the 95% probability level.
Ephemeris Errors 
These are errors in the SVs calculation of position caused by the gravitational effects of the 
sun, moon, planets and solar radiation. The SV position is checked every 12 hours and, where 
necessary, updated. The maximum error will be 2.5 m.
SV Clock Error 
As with SV ephemeris, the SV clock is checked at least every 12 hours and any error is passed to 
the SV to be included in the broadcast. Maximum error 1.5 m.
Ionospheric Propagation Error 
The interaction of the radio energy with the ionized particles in the ionosphere causes the 
radio energy to be slowed down as it traverses the ionosphere, this is known as the ionospheric 
delay. The delay is dependent on both the level of ionization and the frequency of the radio 
waves. The higher the frequency is, the smaller the delay and the higher the levels of ionization, 
the greater the delay. The receiver contains an average model of the ionosphere which is 
used to make time corrections to the measured time interval. The state of the ionosphere is 
continuously checked at the monitoring stations and the required modifications to the model 
is regularly updated to the SVs and thence to the receivers. However, the propagation path 
from the SV to the monitoring station will be very different to that to the receiver, so this is 
only a partial solution.
The ionospheric delay is inversely proportional to the square of the frequencies.
As two different frequencies will experience different delays, by measuring the difference in 
arrival time of the two signals we can deduce the total delay experienced hence minimising the 
error and calculate a very accurate range.
This is the most significant of the errors in SV navigation systems.
Maximum error for single frequency operation is 5 m.
Tropospheric Propagation Error 
Because of the inherent accuracy of SV navigation systems, the effect of variations in 
tropospheric conditions on the passage of radio waves has become significant. Variations 
in pressure, temperature, density and humidity affect the speed of propagation, increased 
density and increased absolute humidity reduce the speed of propagation. For example, a 
change in transit time of one nanosecond would give an error of 0.3 m. As with ionospheric 
propagation error this is minimized with the use of two frequencies.
Receiver Noise Error 
All radio receivers generate internal noise, which in the case of GNS receivers can cause errors 
in measurement of the time difference. Maximum 0.3 m.
Multipath Reception 
Reflections from the ground and parts of the aircraft result in multipath reception. This can 
be minimized by careful siting of the aerial and by internal processing techniques. Maximum 
0.6 m.

Dilution of Precision (DOP) 
The satellite geometry, (angle of cut between position lines), and any error in the pseudo-
ranges (time synchronization) will degrade the accuracy of the calculated position.
GOOD
POOR
Figure 18.18 PDOP
DOP is further divided:
Horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP). This refers to errors in the X and Y coordinates. 
Vertical dilution of precision (VDOP). This refers to errors in the Z coordinate. 
Position dilution of precision (PDOP). This is a combination of HDOP and VDOP.
Time dilution of precision (TDOP). This refers to timing errors. 
Geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). This is a combination of PDOP and TDOP.
Errors caused by PDOP are minimized by the geometry of the positioning of the SVs in their 
orbits and by the receivers selecting the four best SVs to determine position. The SV geometry 
that will provide the most accurate fixing information is one SV directly overhead the receiver 
and the other three SVs close to the horizon and spaced 120° apart.
Effect of Aircraft Manoeuvre 
Aircraft manoeuvre may result in part of the aircraft shadowing one or more of the in-use SVs. 
There are two possible outcomes of this. Firstly, whilst the SV is shadowed, the signal may 
be lost resulting in degradation of accuracy, or the receiver may lock onto reflections from 
other parts of the aircraft again with a reduction in accuracy. The effect of manoeuvre can be 
minimized by careful positioning of the aerial on the aircraft. The optimum position for the 
antenna is on top of the fuselage close to the aircraft’s centre of gravity.
Selective Availability (SA) 
SA was introduced into GPS by the US DOD in about 1995. It deliberately degraded the accuracy 
of the fixing on the C/A code (i.e. for civilian users). The USA withdrew SA at 0000 on 01 May 
2000, and President Clinton stated that it would never be reintroduced. (SA downgraded the 
accuracy of position derived from the C/A code to the order of 100 m spherical error). SA was 
achieved by introducing random errors in the SV clock time, known as dithering the SV clock 
time.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
System Accuracy
The ICAO specification requires an accuracy (95%) of the SPS to be:
•	 Horizontal: 	± 13 m
•	 Vertical: 	
± 22 m
•	 Time: 	
40 nanoseconds (10-9)
Integrity Monitoring
The ICAO specification for radio navigation systems requires a 2 second warning of failure for 
precision systems (e.g. ILS) and 8 second warning for non-precision systems. With 4 SVs being 
used to provide a 3D position, there is no means of detecting the degradation of information 
in any of the SV data and an operator could potentially experience errors of hundreds of miles 
unless he was able to cross-check the GNSS position with another system. Therefore differential 
systems are under development which will determine any degradation in accuracy and allow a 
timely warning of the failure or degradation of the information provided.
Differential GPS (DGPS)
If the SV information degrades, the GPS receiver has no means of determining the degradation. 
Consequentially the safety of flight may be seriously endangered. DGPS is a means of improving 
the accuracy of GPS by monitoring the integrity of the SV data and warning the user of any 
errors which occur. DGPS systems will provide warning of failure in the SV data and prevent or 
minimize the effect of such errors, or provide failure warning and improve the accuracy of the 
deduced position. There are three kinds of DGPS currently in use or under development:
•	 Air based augmentation systems (ABAS)
•	 Ground based augmentation systems (GBAS)
•	 Satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS)
Air Based Augmentation Systems (ABAS)
To determine, at the receiver, if any of the data from any of the SVs is in error requires the 
use of a fifth SV. By comparing positions generated by the combinations of the five SVs it is 
possible to detect errors in the data, and hence which SV is in error. The rogue SV can then be 
deselected. However, once the system is back to 4 SVs the facility is lost. The CAA recommend 
that a minimum of 6 SVs are available, so that if a SV is deselected the integrity monitoring 
continues to be available. The GPS term for this is “receiver autonomous integrity monitoring” 
(RAIM). RAIM has only limited availability at present and would require at least 30 operational 
SVs to achieve continuous global availability. RAIM will only provide failure warning and either 
prevent or minimize errors in computed position arising from erroneous SV data.
Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS)
GBAS is a local area DGPS (LADGPS) implemented through a local area augmentation system 
(LAAS). This system is used in aviation to provide both failure warning and enhancement of the 
GPS receiver position by removing ephemeris and SV clock errors and minimizing ionospheric 
and tropospheric errors. It will not remove errors arising from receiver noise and multipath 
reception as these errors are particular to the receiver. It is specifically established to provide 
precision runway approaches.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
The implementation of a LAAS requires a precisely surveyed site on the aerodrome and a 
means of transmitting the corrections to aircraft operating close to the aerodrome. On the site 
is a GPS receiver which determines the GPS position and compares it with the known position 
of the site. The error in the X, Y and Z coordinates is determined and specially formatted to be 
transmitted to approaching aircraft. The system will detect any errors in the SV data and either 
correct the error or give a failure warning indication.
The data is transmitted to aircraft via a dedicated VHF link.  A pseudolite (pseudo-satellite) is 
also provided to give range to the runway threshold using GNSS techniques.
Figure 18.19 LAAS
When the aircraft is close to the DGPS site, the ionospheric and tropospheric transmission paths 
will be virtually identical so these errors are effectively eliminated. The LAAS has the potential 
to provide the necessary accuracy to achieve category IIIC type operations.
Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS)
SBAS utilize a wide area DGPS (WADGPS) implemented through a wide area augmentation 
system (WAAS). There are four systems currently operating, these are:
The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS), declared operational in 
July 2004.
The USA WAAS, declared operational in July 2003.
The Japanese Multifunctional Transport Satellite Augmentation System, (MSAS).
The Indian Geo and GPS Augmented Navigation (GAGAN).
The objectives of these systems are more or less identical, to provide an integrity monitoring and 
position enhancement to aircraft operating over a large area. The methods of implementation 
differ slightly between systems, but the end result to the user will be the same (i.e. there will 
be full compatibility between the systems). The discussion of WADGPS will centre on EGNOS, 
but the same principles apply to all SBAS.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
There are 3 segments making up SBAS:
The space segment which comprises the GPS and GLONASS constellations and geo-stationary 
SVs.
Note:   Geostationary SVs have an orbital period of 24 hours and are found only in equatorial 
orbits at an altitude of 35 800 km
The ground segment comprising reference stations (RS), regional control stations (RCS) and a 
master control station (MCS) (or navigation earth station (NES)).
The user segment comprised all who use the service.
RS are established within a region to measure the accuracy of the SV data and the ionospheric 
and tropospheric effects on the SV transmissions. As with LAAS the RS are precisely surveyed 
sites containing a GPS receiver and an accurate atomic clock. Each RS is linked to an RCS. The 
RCS will be linked in turn to MCS (or NES).

Figure 18.20 EGNOS Segments
The RS determine their GPS position from the SV data. The RS now, since it knows its own 
position and receives the SV ephemeris, clock time and any clock error corrections, back 
calculates the true position and time at the SV and determines the range error for each SV. It 
also determines if there are significant errors which render any of the SVs’ information unusable, 
hence providing an integrity check on the system. This range error will not deviate significantly 
over a considerable range (400+ km), neither will the relative effects of the ionospheric and 
tropospheric propagation.
The data (SV errors and integrity assessment) is sent via the RCS to the MCS (located at the NATS 
at Gatwick) where it is formatted for use by suitable equipped GPS receivers. The data is then 
sent to Goonhilly Down to be uplinked for broadcast on the East Atlantic and Indian Ocean 
INMARSAT geostationary SVs navigation broadcast channels. The GPS receivers incorporate 
the data into the calculations and achieve both enhancement of position and failure warning.
Whilst the accuracy of GPS will be greatly enhanced by WADGPS, it cannot and is unlikely 
to achieve the accuracy required for category I type operations. These will continue for the 
foreseeable future to require the provision of LAAS. (The best decision height achieved to date 
is about 300 ft, and this is unlikely to be improved upon in the near future).

Combined GPS and GLONASS Systems
Receiver systems combining GPS and GLONASS are under development. The ability to combine 
positional information from the two systems will provide improved accuracy and enhanced 
integrity monitoring. However, since the SV systems use different models of the earth, the 
GLONASS PZ90 generated information will need to be converted to the GPS WGS84 model, or 
vice versa, to provide the final position.
