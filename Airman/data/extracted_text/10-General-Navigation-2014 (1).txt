The Shape of the Earth
The simple view of the shape of the Earth is that it is a sphere, and this is nearly true. In fact, the 
Earth’s shape is commonly described as an oblate spheroid, that is, a sphere which is slightly 
flattened at its poles. This shape developed when the Earth formed from a gas-cloud as the spin 
of the cloud caused higher centrifugal forces at the equatorial region than in regions nearer 
the poles. The flattening is called compression and in the case of the Earth is approximately 
0.3% (1/300th). More simply put, the Earth’s polar diameter is or 23 nautical miles or 43 km 
less than its equatorial diameter. Recent satellite surveys of the Earth have also shown it to be 
slightly pear-shaped with its maximum diameter occurring south of the Equator. This Southern 
hemisphere distortion is considerably less than the compression distortion and is measured in 
tens of metres rather than kilometres.
If the Earth were perfectly spherical, then its cross-section would be a circle. Mathematicians 
could deal with that quite easily in producing the equations necessary to produce map 
projections. If the compression were completely symmetrical, then the cross-section would be 
a perfect ellipse, which would also not be too mathematically complicated.
However, the Earth is not quite either of these, and so the only word to describe it is “Earth-
shaped”. This is what the word geoid (of Greek origin) means.
Geodosy and Geoid Models
A number of different agencies have measured and modelled the Earth (and produced the 
equations to define their geoids). Each agency has tended to optimize its geoid to give the best 
fit to the actual shape of the Earth over the area in which it is interested in mapping. This may 
mean that the geoid does not fit the actual Earth in another part of the world. For example, 
the UK Ordnance Survey uses a geoid based on a survey of 1936 (OS36), France has tended to 
use the Nouvelle Triangulation de France (NTF) 1970 model, some other European countries 
use the European Datum 1950 model (ED50), and the USA uses the World Geodetic System 
1984 (WGS 84).
Use of different geoids can result in arriving at different values for defining latitude and 
longitude. There can be differences of up to the order of 200 metres for positions on the 
extremities of the European ED50 and the UK OS36. This may not sound much to an airline 
pilot - though it would to the programmer of a cruise missile which was guided to latitude and 
longitude coordinates! Until recently, these differences have not been considered significant, 
but two recent developments, however, have changed this. These are the arrival of the Global 
Positioning System (GPS) and the widespread use of Flight Management Systems (FMS).
GPS is an electronic navigation system in which aircraft receivers compare signals from several 
of the 24 transmitters in the satellites which make up the GPS constellation. It can be received 
over the whole globe and its accuracy is of the order of tens of metres. The system accuracy 
is such that the differences in geoids becomes significant, and the system has world-wide 
application. The US government adopted WGS 84 for GPS.
FMS compares the output of Inertial Reference Systems (IRS) with positions derived from range 
information received from Distance Measuring Equipment (DME). The positions of the DME 
stations are stored in latitude and longitude held in the data base of the FMS computer. DME 
is a very accurate system and any inaccuracy in the datum positions would degrade the position 
calculation of FMS. If the data base held the positions of all the UK DMEs in OS36 and the 
French DMEs in NTF70, it could cause large discontinuities in the calculation of FMS position as 
the aircraft crossed the English Channel.

For these reasons, ICAO has adopted WGS 84 as the world standard.
In modern navigation systems, position information is corrected for the distortions of the 
Earth’s shape automatically in the navigation computers.
For any calculations that you may be required to do for the EASA examination syllabus, the 
Earth may be considered to be a true sphere with a circumference of 21 600 NM or 40 000 km.
The Poles
The Poles are defined as the extremities of the axis about which the Earth spins. The axis of 
the Poles is inclined to the axis of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun at an angle of 23½°. This 
topic will be covered more fully in the chapter on “Time”. However, in this chapter the polar 
axis will be drawn upright.
Basic Direction on the Earth
To start to define directions on the Earth, a datum must be selected. The simplest datum is 
the direction in which the Earth is spinning. This is then defined as East, hence sunrise in the 
East. West is then defined as the opposite of East. Facing East, the pole on the left is called the 
North Pole and the direction North is defined as the direction towards the North Pole. The 
pole diametrically opposite the North Pole is called the South Pole and the direction South is 
defined as being opposite to North.
Figure 1.1  Earth’s rotation 
 shown in ‘elevation’
Figure 1.2  Cardinal and quadrantal points
These directions, North, South, East and West are known as Cardinal Points. The midway 
directions between North(N), East(E), South(S), West(W) and North(N) are North-East (NE), 
South-East (SE), South-West (SW) , and North-West (NW). These directions are known as the 
Quadrantal directions.
To solve navigation problems, the student may occasionally need to consider the Earth when 
viewed from above either the North Pole or the South Pole. When viewed from above the 
North Pole, the Earth appears to rotate in an anticlockwise (counter- clockwise) direction. 
When viewed from above the South Pole, the Earth appears to rotate in a clockwise direction.

The system of Cardinal and Quadrantal directions was widely used in maritime navigation. 
Further sub-divisions were made to give more precision but the system is too cumbersome and 
does not allow for the precise definition of direction required in air navigation. To achieve the 
required precision, air navigation terminology retains the cardinal points as a reference but 
uses the Sexagesimal system for measuring directions. 
Sexagesimal System / True Direction
The Sexagesimal system utilizes the fact that a clockwise rotation of direction from North 
through East, South and West and back to North is a circle of 360 degrees. If North is defined 
as 000°, East becomes 090°, South becomes 180° and West becomes 270°. Finally, continuing 
the rotation back to North makes North 360°. In practice, the use of 000° or 360° for North is 
a personal choice (but a northerly runway would be labelled ‘36’).

Direction, Latitude and Longitude
Direction on the Earth is measured in degrees clockwise from North. When the North datum is 
the direction of the North geographic pole, it is referred to as True direction. The abbreviation 
(T) is used, thus:-
North is referred to as 000°(T) 
East is referred to as 090°(T) 
South is referred to as 180°(T) 
West is referred to as 270°(T)
Note: A 3-figure group is always used - 000°(T), not 0°(T)  and 090°(T), not 90°(T)
The use of 3-figure groups for directions is to avoid any ambiguity, particularly in transmitting 
messages by R/T or other means. Any direction of less than a 3-figure group should be treated 
as suspect. For example, 27° could be a corruption of 027° or 270°, or even 127°, 227°, 327°, 
271°, 272°etc. There is one exception to this rule; runway directions are given at 10° intervals 
(to the nearest 10°). For example a RW orientated 273° is called RW 27 and a RW orientated 
078° becomes RW 08. (But beware, Runway Directions are normally given with reference to 
Magnetic North, not True North).
Reciprocal directions. In navigation subjects, it is necessary frequently to calculate the reciprocal 
of a given direction, i.e. that direction which is 180° opposite to the direction given. Thus, if 
you are travelling in a direction of 060°(T), the reciprocal direction is 240°(T), i.e. 060 ± 180. If a 
runway has a direction of 353°(T), the reciprocal runway direction is 173°(T) - 353 ± 180.

Position Reference Systems
Navigation is a fundamental process whereby an aircraft is directed from one position to 
another; it is therefore necessary to use a Position Reference System which defines position 
accurately and unambiguously on the Earth’s surface.
On a plane surface (such as graph paper), position can be defined accurately and unambiguously 
using Cartesian co-ordinates ±x and ±y from 2 mutually perpendicular axes, the X and Y axes. 
For instance, a Cartesian system is used for the UK National Grid System, e.g. Ordnance Survey 
Landranger Maps.
The Cartesian system works well on a flat surface but must be modified to work on a spherical 
surface, i.e. the Earth. In practice, the linear co-ordinates x and y are replaced by angular co- 
ordinates known as Longitude and Latitude. The first requirement for this spherical system is to 
define the 2 mutually perpendicular axes (the equivalents of the X,Y axes). The definition and 
use of these axes involves circles on the Earth - Great Circles and Small Circles.
Circles on the Earth
Great Circle: A circle on the surface of the Earth whose centre and radius are those of the 
Earth itself is called a Great Circle. It is called ‘great’ because a disc cut through the Earth in 
the plane of the Great Circle would have the largest area that can be achieved.
Figure 1.6  Great circle 
The shortest distance between two points on the Earth’s surface is the shorter arc of the 
Great Circle joining the two points.
Given two points on the Earth’s surface, there will be only one Great Circle joining them 
(unless the points are diametrically opposed).

Direction, Latitude and Longitude
The Equator
The Great Circle whose plane is at 90° to the axis of rotation of the Earth (the polar axis) 
is called the Equator. It lies in an East-West direction and divides the Earth equally into two 
hemispheres. For the definition of position on the Earth, the Equator is the datum for defining 
Latitude and is the equivalent of the X axis of the Cartesian system.
The Meridians
Meridians are semi-Great Circles joining the North and South poles. All meridians indicate 
True North-South direction. Every Great Circle passing through the poles forms a meridian 
and its Anti-meridian. The meridians cross the Equator at 90°.
The Prime (or Greenwich) Meridian
The meridian passing through Greenwich is known the Prime Meridian . The Prime Meridian is 
the datum for defining Longitude and is the equivalent of the Y axis of the Cartesian system.
Small Circle
A circle on the surface of the Earth whose centre and radius are not those of the Earth is 
called a Small Circle. The main small circles of relevance to position are the Parallels of Latitude.
Parallels of Latitude
The parallels of latitude are small circles on the surface of the Earth whose planes are parallel 
to the Equator. They lie in an East-West direction. Their function is to indicate position North 
or South of the Equator.
Graticule
The network formed on a map or the surface of a globe by the Prime Meridian, the meridians, 
the Equator and the parallels of latitude is called the Graticule. The graticule is an analogy on 
the Earth’s surface of the X - Y grid on graph paper.

Figure 1.7  Graticule on a globe 
Using the graticule, the position of any point can be accurately and unambiguously defined. 
However, position is defined by angular measurement (degrees, minutes, and seconds of arc), 
not by distance, as on Cartesian co-ordinates. This is the foundation of the Latitude/ Longitude 
system.
Angular Measurements
The fundamental unit of angular measurement is the degree (°) which is defined as the angle 
subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc equal to the 360th part of the circumference 
(hence 360° in a circle).
For more accuracy	
A 
degree 
is 
sub-divided 
into 
60 
minutes 
of 
arc 
(‘)
A minute can be further sub-divided into 60 seconds of arc (“).
The above units are mainly used for angular measurement of position but for angular 
measurement of direction, it is more common to use degrees and decimals of degrees.
Latitude
The latitude of any point is the arc (angular distance) measured along the meridian through 
the point from the Equator to the point. It is expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds of 
arc and is annotated North or South according to whether the point lies North or South of the 
Equator. In Figure 1.8, you are looking at the Earth ‘sideways on’ from space, i.e. the N pole is 
at the top of the diagram. The angular distance between where the meridian of A crosses the 
Equator (point P) and point A is 40° and the latitude of point A is 40°N. (It can also be said that 
A lies on the Parallel of Latitude of 40°N).

Figure 1.8  Latitude
On Figure 1.8, come in from the Equator to the centre of the Earth. Then, for a Northerly 
latitude of, say, 40°N, construct a line from the centre of the Earth with an elevation angle 
from the Equator of 40° (depression angle for Southerly latitudes). Where this line touches the 
surface of the Earth is the 40°N parallel of latitude.
The range of latitude values covers the Equator (0°N/S) to the geographic poles - the North 
Pole is 90°N and the South Pole is 90°S.
Geocentric and Geodetic Latitude
The definition of latitude given above is based on the centre of the Earth, namely it is the 
smaller angle between the line joining the point to the centre of the Earth and the plane 
of the Equator. This is Geocentric Latitude. Because the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, 
a different definition of latitude can be used, namely, Geodetic (or Geographic) Latitude. 
Geodetic (or Geographic) Latitude is the smaller angle between the normal (90°) to the 
meridian at the point on the spheroid and the plane of the Equator. This normal line does not 
necessarily pass through the centre of the spheroid as illustrated in the diagram below. Note 
that the shapes used in the diagram are exaggerated for illustration purposes and the real 
spheroid is much closer to a sphere than shown. The latitudes plotted on navigation charts are 
Geodetic Latitudes. The maximum difference between Geocentric and Geodetic Latitudes 
occurs at approx 45°N/S and is about 11.6 minutes of arc.

Special Cases of Parallels of Latitude
There are several ‘special’ cases of the parallels of latitude (other than the Equator) which will 
be explained in the chapter on “Time”. These relate to the seasons and the periods of day and 
night throughout the year. Briefly these are:
Arctic Circle
the parallel of 66½°N (note that 66½° is the value of the Earth’s 
tilt)
Antarctic Circle
the parallel of 66½°S
Tropic of Cancer
the parallel of 23½°N 
(the Sun is overhead the Tropic of Cancer on mid-summer’s day in 
the Northern hemisphere)
Tropic of Capricorn
the parallel of 23½°S 
(the Sun is overhead the Tropic of Capricorn on mid-winter’s day 
in the Northern hemisphere)

Longitude
The longitude of any point is the shorter distance in the arc along the Equator between the 
Prime Meridian and the meridian through the point. Longitude is measured in degrees and 
minutes of arc and is annotated East (E) or West (W) depending whether the point lies East or 
West of the Prime Meridian (Greenwich). In Figure 1.10, you are looking ‘down’ on the North 
Pole from a point out in space. The meridian of point B crosses the Equator (at point Q) at, say, 
40° of arc to the East of the Prime Meridian. Point B is said to be at longitude 040°E.
Difference in Longitude
When calculating the difference between the longitude of two positions if those positions are 
the same East or West longitude then the one is subtracted from the other ie 100°W - 080°W 
= 20° difference or sometimes called change of longitude (ch long).  If the two longitudes are 
East and West then the two are added together ie 020°W + 010°E = 30° difference or 30° ch 
long.  One anomaly might occur when the two longitudes are East and West and ‘close’ to the 
Greenwich Anti Meridian.
Example.  What is the difference in longitude between 163°E and 152°W?  If the principle above 
was followed the two would be added together to give 315° however we need to consider the 
‘shortest’ value of difference.  In this case if you take the 315° away from 360° you will get 45° 
ch long.
Figure 1.10  Longitude
Longitude can be measured up to 180°E or 180°W of the Prime Meridian. These 2 meridians are 
coincident and are known as the Greenwich Anti-Meridian, normally labelled 180°E or 180°W.

Reversal of the Apparent Sense of Longitude at the Greenwich Anti-
meridian (180°E)
Look at Figure 1.11 and Figure 1.12.
Figure 1.11 
Figure 1.12  
On the Greenwich Meridian, the Eastern Longitudes are East of you. The Western Longitudes 
are West of you. But now travel round the globe to the 180°E longitude (the Greenwich anti-
meridian). The direction of East has not changed. It is still 090°(T), the direction of the Earth’s 
spin. Nor has the direction of West. It is still 270°(T), the opposite direction to the Earth’s spin. 
But in Figure 1.12, the Eastern Longitudes are out to your left (West of you) and the Western 
Longitudes are out to the right of you (East of you). So you get a situation where the Eastern 
hemisphere is to your West and the Western hemisphere is to your East. It can cause confusion 
in solving some navigation problems.
Difference in Principle between Latitude and Longitude
These 2 angular co-ordinate systems are quite different in principle. Lines of latitude are all 
parallel to each other. Indeed, it is normal to talk of ‘parallels of latitude’. Lines of longitude, 
however, emanate from a point (the North Pole), reach a maximum separation at the Equator, 
and then converge back to a point again, at the South Pole.
You may find it a helpful illustration to think of latitude as like slicing a pineapple (parallels of 
latitude) whilst longitude is like segmenting an orange (meridians of longitude).
Positions in Latitude and Longitude
When giving a position in latitude and longitude, the latitude is always quoted first and the 
longitude second: thus New York’s position is 41°N 074°W. Alternative forms are: 41°00’N 
074°00’W, or 4100N 07400W which are used to allow more precision by the inclusion of minutes 
of arc. For example, the Aerodrome Reference Point (ARP) for Oxford Airport is approximately 
51°50’N, 001°19’W or 5150N 00119W. (This is the mid-point of runway 01/19).
Even greater precision can be achieved by quoting position in seconds of arc although this is 
not normally required in these notes. For example, the precise position for the Oxford ARP is 
51°50’12”N, 001°19’11”W or 515012N 0011911W.

Conversion of Latitude and Longitude to Distance on the Earth
The definition of a nautical mile has been chosen to make it relate to angular arc on a Great 
Circle. It so happens that the mean radius of the Earth is approximately 20.9 million feet in 
length. This means that on a Great Circle, 1 minute of arc corresponds to a distance on the 
Earth’s surface of 6080 feet. This distance of 6080 feet can be defined as 1 nautical mile, 
however the ICAO definition of a nautical mile is 1852 metres.
Therefore you can relate angle along a Great Circle arc to distance on the Earth. For instance, 
all meridians (lines of longitude) are Great Circles, so the distance up or down a meridian 
(which is change of latitude) has this relationship. The difference in latitude between positions 
5000N 00100W and 5005N 00100W is exactly 5 minutes, so they are exactly 5 nautical miles 
apart. This is true of differences in longitude only at the Equator, because the Equator is the 
only parallel of latitude which is also a Great Circle.
Resolution Accuracy Using Latitude and Longitude
Suppose a position is quoted as 51°49’N, 001°19’W or 5149N 00119W. By writing 5149, we are 
making a declaration of the accuracy of the resolution we are interested in. We are saying that 
it is nearer to 5149 than 5148 or 5150. This means that we are quoting to the nearest 1 minute 
of latitude, which is an accuracy to the nearest one nautical mile. In longitude, if we write 
00119W, we are also quoting to the nearest minute, but in this case, because at latitude 50N 
the meridians are closer together than at the Equator, we are quoting to about the nearest 0.6 
of a nautical mile. To avoid this complication at this stage, in discussing resolution accuracy, we 
will consider latitude only.
There are 2 ways of quoting positions to a greater accuracy than the nearest whole minute. 
It can either be given as decimal minutes (5150.2N) or as degrees, minutes, seconds (DMS) 
(51°50’12”N). In decimal minutes, only the first decimal place is used. If we need greater 
accuracy than that, we go to DMS.
Normally, modern automatic navigation systems in which positions are entered by the pilot use 
decimal minutes. If a position is entered into an Inertial Navigation System, Inertial Reference 
System, Flight Management Computer, or Global Positioning System, it will be to the nearest 
decimal minute, i.e. 5150.2 N. This is a statement that the position is nearer 5150.2 than 5150.3 
or 5150.1. By quoting to decimal minutes, you are declaring an accuracy of 0.1 of a nautical 
mile, or 608 feet, or 185 metres.
However, where greater accuracy is required, on large-scale maps and charts, positions will be 
given in DMS, i.e. 515013N. In this case, we are declaring an accuracy of the nearest second, 
i.e. the position is nearer 515013 than 515014 or 515012. This is an accuracy of 1/60th of a 
minute, or about 101 feet or 30 metres. The Aerodrome Reference Point (ARP) for Oxford 
Airport, which is the midpoint of Runway 01/19, is quoted in the official CAA publication, the 
UK Aeronautical Information Package (AIP), as 515013N 0011912W.
Even greater accuracy can be achieved by use of decimals of a second. The first decimal place 
implies an accuracy of 1/10th of a second, which is 10 feet, or 3 metres, whilst the use of 
2 decimal places of a second implies an accuracy of 1/100th of a second, i.e. 1 foot, or 30 
centimetres. THE UK AIP quotes the position of the OX locator beacon, our low-powered 
homing beacon at Oxford as 515000.28N 001924.45W, which is an overall accuracy, taking into 
account both latitude and longitude, of within 50 cm. This is perhaps a bit more accurate than 
we really need for a homing aid, but is an appropriate level of accuracy for a landing aid such as

an ILS (Instrument Landing System) localizer. Accuracy at this level would certainly be needed 
for inspection and flight calibration of an ILS.
It says much for the flexibility of this system of position reference that, whilst for most of the 
time in flight we are interested in our position accuracy only to the nearest mile or so, and can 
simply write our position as 5150N 00119W - a total of 11 fairly simple numbers or letters, we 
can also use the system to establish a position to within half a metre by writing 515000.28N 
001924.45W, which is really not too long-winded considering the level of accuracy achieved.

Great Circle Vertices
The northern vertex of a Great Circle is simply the most northerly point on that Great Circle. 
Similarly, the southern vertex is the most southerly point on the Great Circle. The vertices are 
antipodal and the Great Circle distance between them is 10 800 NM.
Figure 1.13   
The vertices lie on meridian and anti-meridian and have latitude values of equal value but of 
opposite sign. For example, if the southern vertex of a Great Circle is 63S 170W, its northern 
vertex will be 63N 010E.
At either of its vertices, the direction of the Great Circle will be East 090°(T) or West 270°(T). 
Knowing the co-ordinates of either vertex enables calculation of where and at what angle the 
Great Circle crosses the Equator.
A Great Circle will cross the Equator at two points whose longitude is 90° change of longitude 
from either of its vertices.  Thus the Great Circle in the example in Figure 1.13 would cross the 
Equator at 080°W and 100°E.
The track angle at which the Great Circle would cross the Equator is based on the latitude of 
each vertex.  The track angle would therefore depend on which direction the Great Circle was 
travelling from the vertex ie East or West.  Thus the Great Circle in the example above would 
cross the Equator at an angle of 63° so the track angle measured at the Equator, if travelling 
Eastbound, would be 90° + 63° = 153°  (see Figure 1.14).  
Having passed the Southern Vertex, still travelling East, the track angle at the second crossing 
of the Equator would be 90° - 63° = 027° (see Figure 1.15).
If the original direction had been West from the Northern Vertex the track angles crossing the 
Equator would be the reciprocal ie 207° and 333°.

A great circle with vertices at 0N/S crosses the Equator at 0°(T) (it is the Equator) and has 
direction 090°(T) or 270°(T).

A Reminder about Great Circles
Great Circle: A circle on the surface of the Earth whose centre and radius are those of the 
Earth itself is called a Great Circle. 
It is called ‘great’ because a disc cut through the Earth in the plane of the Great Circle would 
have the largest area that can be achieved.
Figure 2.1 Great circle 
The shortest distance between two points on the Earth’s surface is the shorter arc of the Great 
Circle joining the two points.
Given two points on the Earth’s surface, there will be only one Great Circle joining them (unless 
the points are diametrically opposed).

The Rhumb Line
Consider the figure below. 
Figure 2.2 Moscow - Vancouver rhumb line track
A Rhumb Line is a regularly curved line on the surface of the Earth which cuts all meridians 
at the same angle - a line of constant direction.
This constant track direction was an enormously important property for all mariners and 
aviators until about 40 years ago, when cheap powerful computing started to become widely 
available. Prior to that, one calculated a constant straight line track and then held the compass 
heading which would give that track. This made establishing the track a relatively simple 
problem although, unlike the Great Circle route, it did not give the shortest distance over the 
Earth between the two points.
--- Page 31 ---

However, in the case of our Moscow to Vancouver route, you can see that the Great Circle track 
between those points passes very close to the North Pole, and is much shorter.
Figure 2.3 Moscow - Vancouver great circle track
Comparing the Great Circle and the Rhumb Line together:

compared with rhumb line

Great Circles, Rhumb Lines & Directions on the Earth
Let us now re-plot the Great Circle track from the globe, taking its position where it crosses 
various coastlines, and transfer it to, for example, a Mercator chart, where Rhumb Lines are 
represented by straight lines
Figure 2.5 Mercator projection with great circle track added
This is a dramatic illustration of the extent to which projections can introduce distortions. It 
does not appear that way on the Mercator Chart, but we know from plotting it on the globe, 
that the Great Circle track is actually the shortest distance over the Earth between Moscow 
and Vancouver. However, notice also that the track direction changes.
Compare the Great Circle track direction on the Mercator projection with the meridians. The 
track starts out as it leaves Moscow with a direction of about 330°. As it passes near the North 
Pole the track direction is about 270°. As it comes into Vancouver, the direction is about 210°. 
The Great Circle track has changed direction - in this case, quite significantly.
Modern computer-based navigation systems can direct the aircraft along a Great Circle route 
and cope with the constantly changing direction of the Great Circle quite easily. However, in 
the early days of air and maritime navigation, compass and navigation equipment was less 
capable and it was found easier to navigate along lines of constant direction - Rhumb Lines.

Great Circles, Rhumb Lines & Directions on the Earth
As with Great Circles, there is only one Rhumb Line that can be drawn between 2 points.
Examples of common Rhumb Lines are:
•	 	
Parallels of Latitude (because they cut all meridians at 90°).
•	 	
Equator (a special case because the Equator is also a Great Circle).
•	 	
Meridians (are also Great Circles and the cut angle involved is 0°).
The Rhumb Line between 2 points will always lie nearer to the Equator than the corresponding 
Great Circle. Conversely, the Great Circle between the 2 points will always lie nearer the 
Pole than the Rhumb Line.
In some explanations the shape of the Rhumb Line may be stated as convex to the Equator or 
concave to the nearer Pole.
Lines Which Are Both Great Circles and Rhumb Lines
The only lines which are both Great Circles and Rhumb Lines are the Equator and any meridian 
(along with its associated anti-meridian). There are no other lines that are both Great Circles 
and Rhumb Lines. The parallels of latitude are Rhumb Lines because they cut all meridians at 
90°, but they are Small Circles as they do not have the same radius and centre as the Earth.
Great Circle Direction
The direction of the Great Circle over the Earth’s surface changes, as we have seen. The Great 
Circle track is always nearer to the nearer pole. In Figure 2.6, which again represents a Mercator 
chart, we have 2 Rhumb Line tracks, each in an E-W direction, one in the Northern hemisphere 
and one in the Southern. Both are at fairly high latitudes (say, 50N or 50S) in order to show a 
reasonable curvature on their Great Circle tracks, but the effect occurs, to some extent, at any 
latitude other than the Equator.

Figure 2.6 Change in direction of great circle tracks
Northern hemisphere.  Consider the track left to right in the Northern hemisphere - a Rhumb 
Line track of 090°.
If heading in an Easterly direction, the Great Circle track starts with an initial direction of 
about 030°, then curves round to 090° and finishes up on about 150°. In other words, the track 
direction is increasing.
If heading in a Westerly direction, the Great Circle track starts with an initial direction of about 
330°, then curves round to 270° and finishes up on about 210°. In other words, the track 
direction is decreasing.
Southern hemisphere.  Consider the track left to right in the Southern hemisphere - a Rhumb 
Line track of 090°.
If heading in an Easterly direction, the Great Circle track starts with an initial direction of 
about 150°, then curves round to 090° and finishes up on about 030°. In other words, the track 
direction is decreasing.
If heading in a Westerly direction, the Great Circle track starts with an initial direction of about 
210°, then curves round to 270° and finishes up on about 330°. In other words, the track 
direction is increasing.

This can be summarized in the following diagram. North and South represent the hemispheres. 
Left and right indicate that the track direction is Easterly (right) or Westerly (left). This gives a 
diagram which spells out DIID - (decreasing - increasing - increasing - decreasing).
Figure 2.7 Direction of great circle track
In all the above cases, note that the Great Circle direction always changes towards the 
Equator.
Distance on the Earth
Both metric and Imperial measures are in common use in aviation. Because many students 
will not have used the smaller Imperial measures of distance, the conversions below should be 
remembered.
1 metre (m)
= 100 centimetres (cm) 
= 1000 millimetres (mm)
1 centimetre (cm)
= 10 millimetres (mm)
1 metre (m)
= 3.28 feet (ft)
1 foot (ft)
= 12 inches ( ‘in’ or “ )
1 inch (in)
= 2.54 centimetres (cm)
1 yard (yd)
= 3 feet (ft)
The Navigation Computer is accurate enough for any conversion for the purposes of aviation.

The Kilometre (km). The definition of the kilometre is 1/10 000th of the average distance 
on the Earth between the Equator and either Pole. Thus there are 10 000 km between the 
Equator and either Pole, and the circumference of the Earth is 40 000 km.
For conversions between kilometres and imperial units:
	
1 kilometre (km)	
=	
3280 feet (ft)
	
1 metre (m)	
	
=	
3.28 ft
The Statute Mile (stat.m). Although the statute mile (5280 feet) is widely used on the ground 
it is hardly ever used in aviation nowadays. Older airspeed indicators used to be calibrated in 
mph, and still are for some American light aircraft, but this is now rare. Also, visibility is still 
given in statute miles in the USA. Otherwise, the only time a modern pilot will need to know 
about mph is to inform passengers in UK or US aircraft how fast the aircraft is travelling in 
terms of the same units they use in their cars.
The Nautical Mile (NM). The nautical mile is the most important large measure of distance 
used in aviation because it can be related directly to the angular measurements of the Latitude/ 
Longitude graticule of the Earth.
The ICAO definition of the nautical mile is that it is a measure of distance of 1852 metres.
The Standard Nautical Mile is defined as a length of 6080 feet.	
(You may have noticed that 1852 metres converted to feet at a factor of 3.28 does not give 
exactly 6080 feet. For all EASA ATPL practical use, either 1852 metres or 6080 feet will give 
close enough answers to any problems which you will have to solve).
Because they all use Great Circle arcs, the definition of the nautical mile is similar to the 
definitions of Latitude and Longitude. Remember the following:
One minute of latitude = 1 nautical mile (NM) One degree of latitude = 60 minutes = 60 NM
But
One minute of longitude = 1 NM AT THE EQUATOR ONLY.
As there are 90° of latitude change between the Equator and the Poles, the distance between 
the Equator and the Poles is 90 × 60 = 5400 NM
The circumference of the Earth at the Equator is 360 × 60 = 21 600 NM
Variations in the Length of a Nautical Mile
The full definition of the length of a nautical mile is that length of arc of a Great Circle which 
subtends an angle of one minute at the centre of curvature of the Earth’s surface.
It might seem initially, therefore, that the longer the Earth radius, the longer the nautical mile, 
and this would be true if we used geocentric latitude. However, our system of latitude and 
longitude is based on geodetic, not geocentric, latitude.
Because the Earth is flattened at the Poles, the radius of curvature is increased and a greater 
arc is required to subtend an angle of one minute at the centre of curvature, hence a nautical

Great Circles, Rhumb Lines & Directions on the Earth
mile is longer at the Poles, at about 6108 feet. The amount of curvature is greatest at the 
Equator (the radius of curvature is decreased) and therefore the length of arc required to 
generate an angle of one minute at the centre of curvature is less. A nautical mile is shortest 
at the Equator and measures about 6048 feet. The average value, 6076.1 feet, is known as the 
International Nautical Mile and it is approximately 1852 metres. However, as stated before, for 
navigation calculations on this course, the Standard (or Admiralty) Nautical Mile of 6080 feet 
will be used.
Figure 2.8 Geodetic and geocentric latitude
Conversion Factors
5400 nautical miles (from the Equator to either pole) = 10 000 kilometres
21 600 nautical miles (circumference of the Earth) = 40 000 kilometres
Great Circle Distances
The Great Circle distance between any 2 points on the Earth can be calculated using a general 
equation involving spherical geometry - this is not part of the EASA syllabus. Consequently, 
ATPL problems involving the calculation of Great Circle distances are limited to those where 
the 2 points lie on the special Great Circles, i.e. on the same meridian, on meridian and anti-
meridian, or on the Equator.
There are 5 general cases illustrated in the following examples. In all the examples, consider the 
direction that is flown - there may be some surprises!
The latitudes/longitudes for the named points are chosen to illustrate the example and are 
only in the approximate geographic ‘ball-park’.

Example 1 - Same meridian, same hemisphere
What is the shortest (great circle) distance between (A) London (5137N 00012W) and (B) Accra 
(0648N 00012W)?
Note: Both positions are on the same meridian (00012W).
Draw a simple sectional diagram of the Earth as below using the Great Circle formed by the 
00012W meridian and its anti-meridian (17948E) although the latter is not needed for this 
example.
Figure 2.9 
The positions of B (06°48’ north of the Equator measured at the centre of the Earth, C) and A 
(51°37’ north of the Equator) are shown both on the 00012’W meridian. The angular distance 
between them (Change in Latitude or ch.lat) is 51°37’ - 06°48’ = 44°49’ South from A to B.
To calculate the Great Circle distance from A to B, convert the angular distance into linear 
distance , i.e. multiply the degrees by 60 and add the extra minutes.
Thus 44°49’ = (44 × 60) + 49  = 2689 minutes of latitude
= 2689 NM
Be prepared to convert this answer to km or stat.m as required by the question. Always read 
the question carefully because although the basic calculation is done in NM, the Examiner may 
want the answer in different units.

Example 2 - Same meridian, different hemispheres
What is the shortest distance between (D) Durban (2930S 03030E) and (E) Leningrad (5947N 
03030E)?
Again, note that both positions are on the same meridian but in this case they are in opposite 
hemispheres. Draw a sectional diagram as below.
Figure 2.10 
The ch.lat is now 29°30’ plus 59°47’ so the angular distance between D and E is 89°17’ north 
from D. The linear distance is (89 × 60) + 17 = 5357 NM

Example 3 - Meridian and anti-meridian, same hemisphere
What is the shortest distance between (F) Rome (4155N 01110E) and (G) Honolulu (2117N 
16850W)?
Both positions are in the same hemisphere but they are on meridian and anti-meridian - the 
two longitude values are of opposite sign and add up numerically to 180°.
011°10’E + 168°50’W = 180° 
Draw a sectional diagram as follows:
Figure 2.11 
The Great Circle between F (Rome) and G (Honolulu) is over the North Pole - a surprising 
but important result if you wanted to travel in one stage. By inspection, the simplest way to 
calculate the angular distance in this case is to add the 2 latitudes and subtract their total from 
180°, i.e. Angular distance = 180° - ( 41°55’ + 21°17’ ) = 180° - 63°12’ = 116°48’.
An alternative method is to calculate the ch.lat from F to the Pole ( 90° - 41°55’ = 48°05’) and 
from the Pole to G ( 90° - 21°17’ = 68°43’) and add the two to give the total angular distance. 
(48°05’ + 68°43’ =116°48’).
Both methods are mathematically the same.
Angular distance 116° 48’ = (116 × 60) + 48 = 7008 NM.
The initial direction from F to the pole is north and then south from the Pole to G.

Example 4. Meridian and anti-meridian, different hemispheres.
What is the shortest distance between (J) Tokyo (3557N 13535E) and (K) Rio de Janeiro (2210S 
04425W)?
This is the most difficult of the cases discussed. Note again that the longitudes have opposite 
signs and add up to 180° - another meridian and anti-meridian case but with the latitudes in 
different hemispheres. Draw the sectional diagram as follows:
Figure 2.12 
If the angles are drawn reasonably accurately, it is possible by inspection to see that the shortest 
distance between J and K is again via the North Pole and, therefore, to base the calculation 
on that route. Travelling to the North Pole from J is an angular distance of 90°- 35°57’ = 54°03’ 
north; from the North Pole to the Equator is a further 90° but now south; from the Equator 
to K is 22°10’ south. Adding these 3 stages together gives a total angular distance of 166°13’ 
which equates to a linear distance of (166 × 60) + 13 = 9973 NM.
If the initial decision had been to route via the South Pole, the values would have been 35°57’ 
south + 90° south + (90°- 22°10’ = 67°50’) north = 193°47’. Because the angular distance is greater 
than 180°, this solution is the longer way around the Earth. There is no need to recalculate but 
simply subtract the longer angular distance from 360° to give the correct answer, i.e. 360° - 
193°47’ = 166°13’. Alternatively, continue the wrong calculation to give a linear distance of 
(193 × 60) + 47 = 11 627 NM and subtract this distance from the circumference of the Earth, 
21 600 NM. Thus the correct answer is 21 600 - 11 627 = 9973 NM. Remember also to change 
the directions involved.

Example 5 - Two points on the Equator
What is the shortest distance between (L) Dakar (0000N 01635W) and (M) Singapore (0000N 
10355E)?
This example uses the fact that a minute of longitude equals one nautical mile but only at 
the Equator. The sectional diagram is drawn in the plane of the Equator viewed from above 
the North Pole and, for reference, the Prime Meridian (00E/W) and the Anti-Prime Meridian 
(180E/W) are drawn.
Figure 2.13 
The change of longitude (ch.long) from L to M is 016°35’ in an easterly direction to the Prime 
Meridian and a further 103°55’ in an easterly direction to M giving a total easterly ch.long of 
120°30’. At the Equator only, an angular measurement of 120°30’ equals a linear measurement 
of (120 × 60) + 30 = 7230 NM.

Example 6 - A special case
What is the shortest distance between (N) Greenwich (5130N 00000E) and (P) Antipodes Island 
(5130S 18000E)?
Figure 2.14 
The points N and P are on meridian and anti-meridian and have equal latitudes north and 
south of the Equator. They are diametrically opposite each other on the same great circle and 
are said to be antipodal , hence Captain Cook named the nearest land diametrically opposite 
London as Antipodes Island. The great circle distance between any point and its antipodes is 
180° in angular terms, 10 800 NM in linear measure, i.e. the semi-circumference of the Earth.
Mean Latitude
To calculate the mean latitude between two positions add the two latitudes together and 
divide the result by 2.
Example 1
Find the mean latitude between 52˚17’N and 17˚57’N?
52˚17’N + 17˚57’N = 70˚14’ ÷ 2 = 35˚07’N
Example 2
Find the mean latitude between 35˚25’N and 13˚38’S?
Because the latitudes are in opposite hemispheres to find the mean latitude you must take the 
24˚31.5’ away from 35˚25’N to give 10˚53.5’N

True Direction
In the chapter on the Form of the Earth, we defined direction with reference to the poles about 
which the Earth spins (North or South) and the direction in which the Earth spins (East). This is 
the basis of what is known as True Direction and is what is shown on maps. If you need to fly 
from, say, Oxford to Leicester, you draw a straight line on the map (assuming that there are no 
air traffic or other obstacles) between the two airports and measure its direction. This is a True 
direction. Notice that, at this stage, there has been no reference to magnetic compasses. If 
there were such a thing as a “compass that works in True Direction”, we would not even need 
to consider Earth magnetism. However, until about 50 years ago, no such thing existed. (They 
do now - the Inertial Navigation System (INS) finds its direction by establishing the direction 
of Earth rotation, and so is a genuine “true compass”. But these are very expensive and are 
fitted only to sophisticated aircraft). Most aircraft are still steered by a magnetic compass, and 
even aircraft with INS will have a standby compass, which will be magnetic.
Magnetic Direction
It has been known for hundreds, and probably for thousands, of years, that it is possible to 
hold a reasonably constant direction by making use of Earth magnetism. Because the centre 
of the Earth is still cooling down, at its centre is a mass of molten liquid. This has the effect of 
making the Earth act magnetically as though there were a huge bar magnet running through 
it, aligned fairly closely to the North and South True poles.
The alignment of this magnetic effect is only approximately in line with the True poles and 
this can lead to marked differences between True and Magnetic direction in some parts of the 
world. Furthermore, the magnetic pattern is not symmetrical in the N - S sense; the North and 
South magnetic poles are not exactly opposite each other on the Earth. In effect, it is like a 
bent bar magnet.
Figure 3.1 The Earth’s poles 
Magnetic North
Magnetic North is the horizontal direction indicated by a freely suspended magnet influenced 
only by the Earth’s magnetic field. This direction is sometimes referred to as the ‘magnetic 
meridian’ at that point.
Magnetic Direction is measured from Magnetic North clockwise through 360°, and is suffixed 
by the letter ‘M’, e.g. 043(M) and 270(M).

Variation
Variation is the angular difference between the directions of True and Magnetic North at any 
point.
Variation is the angle between True and Magnetic North and is measured in degrees East 
or West from True North.
A line on the surface of the Earth joining points of equal magnetic variation is called an 
Isogonal.
Change of Variation According to Observer’s Position on the Earth
The amount and the direction of variation depends on the relative geometry of the observer, 
the True Poles, and the Magnetic Poles.
Consider Figure 3.2. It shows the True North Pole and the Magnetic North Pole. The red line on 
the globe is the current longitude of the Magnetic North Pole (about 120°W).
Figure 3.2 Idealized model of world variation 
To an observer at A, True North is the direction up the meridian at A to the True North Pole. 
Magnetic North is the direction that his compass needle will point, i.e. towards the Magnetic 
North Pole, which, from A, is to the right (East) of True North. In other words, Magnetic North 
is East of True North.
To an observer at B, the direction of Magnetic North will be left of True North because the 
geometry of the relative positions is different. Magnetic North is West of True North.
--- Page 53 ---

Earth Magnetism
Now consider an observer at C. For him, as for the case of A, Magnetic North is East of True 
North. However, because he is so much further away from both of them, the difference in their 
directions (i.e. the variation) is a smaller angle.
Similarly, for an observer at D, like the one at B, Magnetic North is West of True North, so 
variation is West. However, it will be a smaller angle of variation than for the observer at B. 
Note also the situation for an observer at E. We have started at the True Pole, taken the Great 
Circle to the Magnetic Pole and then continued it in a Great Circle round the Earth. To an 
observer at E, the line joining him to the Magnetic North Pole and to the True North Pole will 
be the same Great Circle. It will be the direction of True North (i.e. straight up the meridian) 
and it will also be the direction in which his compass needle will point. For him, the value of 
variation will be zero.
This line is called the Agonic Line. It is the line connecting points of zero variation.
Situation at the Poles
For an aircraft flying between the North True Pole and the North Magnetic Pole, the variation 
on that shorter arc of the Great Circle is not zero, it is 180°. Consider the diagram below.
Figure 3.3 True and magnetic north poles - idealized 
An aircraft is at position ‘A’, somewhere on the line between the North True Pole and the North 
Magnetic Pole. The meridian connecting him to the True Pole is the direction of True North. 
However, its compass needle will point at the Magnetic North Pole, in exactly the opposite 
direction. The variation at this point will be 180°. The zero variation line is shown in yellow and 
the 180° variation line is shown in green.
Therefore, the maximum possible value of variation is 180° and this occurs at both the North 
and the South Poles.

The Real Variation Map
Figure 3.3 showed a somewhat idealized situation. As we said earlier, the North and South 
Magnetic Poles are not actually antipodal (i.e. not directly opposite each other). There is no 
reason why they should be. Earth magnetism is not really caused by a large bar magnet - 
this is simply a convenient analogy. It is actually caused by the swirling of molten magnetic 
magma below the surface of the Earth. The effect is more like a bent bar magnet. The National 
Environmental Research Council (NERC) magnetic map for 1st Jan 2000 positions the North 
Magnetic Pole at approximately 81N 110W whilst the South Magnetic Pole is at 63S 135E. The 
position of the North Magnetic Pole in 2009 was 84N 120W.
The actual situation is shown by the charts at Figure 3.4, Figure 3.5, and Figure 3.6. The 
disposition of variation is not quite as geometrically neat as the diagram in Figure 3.3, but 
there definitely are 2 lines of zero variation, one running southwards from the True North Pole 
and the other running southwards from the Magnetic Pole. One runs down through Europe 
(the variation near Stuttgart, in Germany, is zero) and the other runs down through the USA.

Figure 3.5 Variation at the South Pole (Charts supplied by the British Geological Survey 
(NERC) in March 2002)
The agonic line running down through the USA continues through South America (Figure 3.4) 
and then continues to the True South Pole (Figure 3.5), much as one would expect from the 
idealized model. However, the agonic line running down out of the North True Pole passes 
through Stuttgart into Central Africa, then curves upward again back onto the North Polar 
chart (Figure 3.4) into North Central Asia, then southwards again through Australia to the 
South Magnetic Pole.
It is important to realize that isogonals are not the actual magnetic lines of flux (which are a 
natural phenomenon). They are the difference between the alignment of the lines of flux and 
the local direction of True North at any point.

Real Variation at the Poles
Figure 3.6 shows the actual variation at the North Poles. The agonic line running up from 
Europe (yellow) changes to 180° (black) at the True North Pole. The red isogonals round the 
True Pole go from 015°E to 180°E variation whilst the blue ones go from 015°W to 180°W.
Figure 3.6 Variation at the North Pole (Chart supplied by the British Geological Survey (NERC) in March 2002)
Therefore the isogonals converge on the True North Pole.
However, exactly the same thing occurs round the Magnetic North Pole. The agonic line running 
up from the USA (yellow) changes to 180° variation (black) between Magnetic and True Poles. 
Again, the red isogonals round the Magnetic Pole go from zero to 180°E variation whilst the 
blue ones go from zero to 180°W. Therefore, the isogonals converge on the Magnetic North 
Pole as well. A study of Figure 3.5 will show the same phenomenon at the South Poles also.
Isogonals converge on both the True and the Magnetic North and South Poles.
Changes in Variation over Time
The value of variation at any point on the Earth changes over a period of time. For instance, the 
present (2012) value of variation at Oxford is about 2°W. However, this appears to be reducing 
at a rate of approximately one degree every 9 years. In 1960, Oxford’s variation was about 
8°W and, if the present trend continues, the value should fall to zero in about 2040, becoming 
easterly subsequently. Other changes are taking place in other parts of the world.
The reason for the change is that the position of the Magnetic North Pole (which is to the West 
of Oxford, but by more than 90°W of longitude) is moving westwards round the North True 
Pole, thereby reducing the variation. The reasons for this movement are not fully understood, 
but it is evidently associated with movement of the molten magma in the Earth’s core.

Earth Magnetism
At one time it used to be thought that the Magnetic North Pole rotated in a near-perfect 
circle round the True Pole at a rate of one revolution every 960 years. However, this hypothesis 
was based simply on empirical observation over a period of time and more recent and 
accurate observation over the last 50 years has shown that, at least over the last few years, 
the Magnetic Pole has moved northwards as well as westwards. All that can be said is that 
the Earth’s magnetic field is certainly changing, and by observing it over a period of time and 
extrapolating the change, we can make reasonably accurate forecasts of variation for up to 
about ten years ahead.
There appear to be at least 3 predictable cycles in the pattern:
Secular. The secular movement is this long-term change described above.
Annual. Superimposed on this long-term change is a sinusoidal change with a period of one 
year. This is associated with the Earth’s orbit round the Sun.
Diurnal. Superimposed on these 2 patterns is a sinusoidal change with a period of one day. 
This appears to be associated with the daily changes in the height of the ionosphere as the 
Earth rotates, presenting different areas of the upper atmosphere to the Sun. The variation can 
change up to about 0.1° over the course of a day.
In addition, there are unpredictable changes. One is associated with solar activity and one with 
local anomalies.
Solar Activity. The Sun experiences cycles of sunspot activity which peak every 11 years. Huge 
solar flares are expelled far out into space. The period is predictable, but whether it affects 
the Earth is not. If one of these flares is pointed towards Earth, a tongue of intense ionisation 
curls around the upper atmosphere, causing various effects, the most notable of which is the 
Aurora Borealis (the Northern Lights). There is also a similar effect round the South Magnetic 
Pole, called the Aurora Australis.
These are known as ‘magnetic storms’ and the effects can be very intense. During the most 
recent of these 11-year cycles, variation changes of up to 7° were observed. Sunspot activity 
and solar flares occur at other times as well and minor magnetic storms can occur outside the 
11-year peak of the period.
Local Anomalies. Local magnetic anomalies are caused by magnetic deposits or rock formations 
that cause the field to be different within a particular area.
In addition, scientific surveys have shown that variation can change slightly with altitude, 
though few aircraft systems would be sensitive enough for this effect to be noticed.
Accordingly, it is very difficult to know the precise instantaneous value of variation affecting 
an aircraft to better than about 2 degrees and, even if great care is taken over finding and 
correcting for it, to better than about half a degree over a period of time. This is why the 
emergence of systems based on highly accurate gyros, particularly INS, in the 1960s/70s was 
such a major advance in navigation technology. It was not merely that they calculated present 
position, important though that was. It was because, for the first time, there was a source of 
accurate reliable heading.

Updating Isogonals
Pilots should always fly with the most up-to-date chart for flight safety reasons. Aeronautical 
information is constantly changing, airways are re-aligned, the positions and frequencies of 
VORs and DMEs are changed and danger areas alter shape or are moved as civil and defence 
requirements change within a country. If the chart is republished at frequent intervals, the 
isogonals should be comparatively recent as well and for most radio navigation charts it is not 
normally necessary to update the isogonals.
However, the interval between reissues of topographical maps may be considerably longer - 
perhaps every 5 or 10 years. In this case, if the variation has changed significantly, it may be 
necessary for the pilot to bring the isogonals up to date during the flight planning process. On 
most maps and charts the year of origin is shown and some indication of the annual change 
(due to the movement of the magnetic poles) is given. This may be done by a small arrow 
showing the direction and distance of the annual change of the position of the isogonal as in 
Figure 3.7,
Figure 3.7
or by a statement giving the annual change in the variation quoted on the isogonal as in 
Figure 3.8.

Magnetic Dip Angle
Consider the diagram at Figure 3.9, showing the lines of magnetic force round the Earth’s 
surface. Imagine aircraft at positions A, B, and C. The lines of force will make different angles 
to the horizontal in each location. This angle is known as the Angle of Dip and is shown 
diagrammatically in Figure 3.10.
Figure 3.9 Lines of force
The Earth’s Magnetic field is along the total line of force, shown as T. This can be resolved into 
a horizontal component H and a vertical component Z.
Vertical Component. The vertical component Z is of no value in determining horizontal 
direction. In fact, it is undesirable for two reasons.
Firstly, it causes the needle of a direct reading magnetic compass to dip from the horizontal. 
This is partially corrected by the use of pendulous suspension, but the end result is that the 
needle still hangs down to some extent, so that the centre of gravity is no longer directly 
below the centre of suspension, thereby resulting in the well-known problems of turning and 
acceleration errors.

Earth Magnetism
Secondly, the vertical component of the Earth’s field induces vertical soft-iron magnetism in 
the aircraft, thereby increasing the deviation.
Horizontal Component. The horizontal component is the part which is detected by the compass 
needle in order to determine magnetic north and is known as the directive force. In the region 
of the magnetic equator the strength of the directive force H approaches the value of T, while 
Z approaches zero as does the angle of dip.
Figure 3.11 considers positions A, B, and C on the Earth’s surface as shown in Figure 3.9. It 
becomes apparent that the directive force H decreases as the angle of dip increases, and vice 
versa.
Figure 3.11 The effect of latitude on the components of dip1
When either of the Earth’s magnetic poles is approached, this component approaches zero 
strength, while the value of Z approaches that of T.
Magnetic field strength is measured in units of microteslas. The generally accepted figure at 
which the horizontal component of the Earth’s field becomes too small to be detected by a 
compass is 6 microteslas. Clearly, in practice, the actual detection threshold will depend on the 
design of the particular compass being used, but 6 µT is the notional figure normally quoted.
The maximum possible dip angle is 90° and this occurs overhead the North and South 
Magnetic Poles.

Figure 3.12 is an illustration of the 6 µT zone round the North Poles. This particular diagram is 
dated about 1950, but it has been chosen because the type of projection shows a reasonably 
representative shape near the Poles.
Figure 3.12 The 6 µT zone in the Arctic - polar projection
Figure 3.13 and Figure 3.14 show more recent surveys of the 6 µT zone. They have been included 
because they demonstrate that there is a 6 µT zone around the South Magnetic Pole as well 
as the North. They are dated 01 Jan 2000. The projection used is a Winkel, which introduces 
distortions near the True Pole, which has the effect of making the zone round the North Pole 
appear larger than the one round the South when, in fact, they are approximately the same 
size and shape.

In fact, the relationship between H and dip angle is not quite as simple as suggested by
Figure 3.14 because of irregularities in the pattern of the Earth’s field and changes with position 
and time of the total magnetic force T.
The angle of dip at Oxford is about 66° but the use of pendulous suspension in a simple Direct 
Reading Compass reduces the dip of the magnetic compass assembly to about 2°. However, 
this small residual angle is still sufficient to give the well-known turning and acceleration errors.
Deviation
In addition to the correction for the difference between True and Magnetic North (variation), 
there is a further correction to be applied. This is for the difference between Magnetic North 
and the direction that a compass needle points. Why are these not the same?
The reason is that the aircraft itself is full of magnetic influences (metal, electric currents, etc.) 
and so acts partially as a magnet itself. Therefore, the compass needle is mainly attracted to 
the Magnetic North Pole, but partially attracted to the magnetism within the aircraft. This 
aircraft magnetism deflects the compass needle from Magnetic North to a new direction, 
which we call Compass North. The difference between Magnetic North and Compass North is 
called Deviation.
Deviation is defined as the angle measured at a point between the direction indicated by a 
compass needle and the direction of Magnetic North.
It is termed East or West according to whether Compass North lies to the East or West of 
Magnetic North.
Deviation can also be quoted as plus or minus. For instance a deviation of -3° is the same as 3°W 
deviation. Plus is East, minus is West. The reason for this is that deviation is seen as a correction 
to be applied to the compass in order to establish Magnetic heading.
When deviations are quoted as plus or minus they are to be applied to the compass heading 
in order to give magnetic heading.

Application of Variation and Deviation
When Magnetic direction is the same as True direction the variation is nil; otherwise Magnetic 
North direction may lie either to the West or East of the True North Direction. See Figure 3.15 
& Figure 3.16.
Figure 3.15  Westerly variation

The direction of the aircraft relative to 
True North is 105°
The direction of the aircraft relative to True 
North is 105°
The direction of the aircraft relative to 
Magnetic North is 122°.
The direction of the aircraft relative to 
Magnetic North is 088°.
Magnetic North is to the West of True 
North of True North.
Magnetic North is to the East of True North.
VARIATION IS 17°W
VARIATION IS 17°E
The direction in which the fore and aft axis of the aircraft is pointing is known as the aircraft’s 
heading.
We are thus able to complete the following tables:-

The signs for plus and minus are sometimes used as a prefix instead of the suffixes East or West, 
in which case you will see that the rule is to apply the deviation (as stated) to the Compass 
Heading to obtain the Magnetic Heading and conversely apply the deviation (with the sign 
changed) to Magnetic Heading to obtain Compass Heading.
For example:-
Deviation 3°E
Hdg 263(M)	
deviation 3°E	 Deviation East Compass Least	Hdg 260(C)
Hdg 260(C)	
deviation 3°E	 Deviation East Compass Least	Hdg 263(M)
Alternatively Deviation +3°
Hdg 263(M)	
deviation +3 to convert from Magnetic to Compass.
Change the sign and apply to Hdg(M);
Hdg 263 - 3 = Hdg 260(C)
Or Apply deviation to Hdg (C)
Hdg 260(C)   +  3   to convert from Compass to Magnetic.
Hdg 260+3 = Hdg 263(M)
Another rule, equivalent to the one stated above, is also used:-
From Compass to Magnetic the signs are true (E is +, W is -)

Definitions
Definitions of terms associated with direction on the Earth.
Heading is the direction in which the fore and aft axis of the aircraft is pointing; it may be 
measured from True, Magnetic, or Compass North.
Variation is the angle measured at a point between True North direction and the direction 
indicated by a freely suspended compass needle influenced only by the Earth’s magnetic field. 
It is termed East or West according to whether Magnetic North lies to the East or West of True 
North.
Deviation is the angle measured at a point between the direction indicated by a compass 
needle and the direction of Magnetic North. It is termed East or West according to whether 
the Compass North lies to the East or West of Magnetic North.
Isogonals are pecked lines on a map or chart joining places of equal magnetic variation.
Agonic Line is the name given to isogonals joining places of zero variation.
The Angle of Dip is the angle in the vertical plane between the horizontal and the Earth’s 
magnetic field at a point.
Isoclinals are lines on a map or chart joining places of equal magnetic dip.
Aclinic Lines is the name given to isoclinals joining places of zero dip. 
Note:- Isoclinals and Aclinic lines do not appear on Navigation charts.

The Navigation Computer
The Navigation Computer is an analogue computer used to solve navigation and flight planning 
problems quickly and easily. The EASA regulations allow students to take the analogue 
computer of their choice into the General Navigation examination and several manufacturers 
make suitable products. The diagrams in these notes are based on the Pooley CRP-5. If students 
choose to buy other computers, it will be their own responsibility to adapt the examples to 
their own instruments.
Navigation Computer calculations form a large part of the General Navigation EASA ATPL 
examination. Almost 25% of the exam comprises direct Navigation Computer questions and 
many of the other questions can often be solved faster with a Navigation Computer than by 
calculator. Rapid operation of the Navigation Computer is also fundamental to Flight Planning. 
It is essential that you learn to operate the Navigation Computer quickly and accurately. Those 
who do not make the effort to master it completely lose marks unnecessarily in exams.
The Navigation Computer has 2 faces:-
A circular slide rule face
A wind face.
This chapter deals with the slide rule face.
Slide Rule Theory
It is easier to learn how to use the Navigation Computer if you understand the theory behind 
it rather than simply learning how to do the operations parrot-fashion. The advent of digital 
calculators over the last 30 years has meant that few students have experience of the old- 
fashioned engineer’s slide rule. The Navigation Computer uses the same slide rule theory 
except that instead of the scales being presented on a straight ruler they are on 2 circular discs.
We will start this explanation by imagining that we have a problem of addition, not 
multiplication.
Imagine that you had to add two numbers, but you had never learnt how to do simple addition. 
One way to solve the problem would be to use two rulers.
Figure 4.1 Two straight linear rulers
--- Page 76 ---

The Navigation Computer - Slide Rule Face
Suppose you had to add 3 + 2. Put the zero of the top ruler against the ‘3’ on the bottom, as 
in Figure 4.2
Now look down from the ‘2’ on the top ruler to read off the ‘5’ on the bottom.
Figure 4.2 Adding 3 + 2 
In addition, note that with just one alignment of the ruler you can also read off the answer to 
the sum:-
Figure 4.3 Multiple simultaneous additions 
3 + any other number = ?
Note: You can also subtract. In Figure 4.4, by aligning ‘4’ on the bottom ruler with ‘1’ on the 
top ruler and then looking back to the zero on the top ruler, you can read off the answer ‘3’.

The Navigation Computer - Slide Rule Face
Figure 4.4  Subtraction 
Now, keeping that at the back of our mind, let us deal with a different problem. Suppose you 
had to multiply 4 × 8, but had never learnt to do simple multiplication. Another way to tackle 
this problem would be to treat it as 22 × 23.
This is the same as saying 2 × 2     ×     2 × 2 × 2, which is 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2.
So 22 × 23 = 25
In other words, to multiply 2 numbers expressed as powers of the same base, you add their 
indices.
Now, if we put our numbers on a ruler again, but on a logarithmic, not a linear scale, the length 
of the rulers is scaled in proportion to their indices.
Figure 4.5  Logarithmic v linear scale 
We can now use our rulers for multiplying and dividing instead of adding and subtracting. This 
is much more useful.

For example, in order to multiply by 2, we align the ‘1’ on the top scale with the ‘2’ on the 
bottom scale.
Figure 4.6  Multiplication 
Then, by simply reading off the top scale at any point we can find that number multiplied by 
2 on the bottom scale.
This works for any number. Suppose we now want to multiply by 3. All we do is align the ‘3’ 
on the bottom scale with the ‘1’ on the top scale as in Figure 4.7 below. We have now set the 
scales in the ratio 3:1. We do not need a different scale for each number. The same 2 scales do 
all numbers.
Figure 4.7  Multiplying by a different number 
Now ‘1’ is aligned with ‘3’, ‘2’ is aligned with ‘6’, ‘3’ is aligned with ‘9’, and so on.
Note that it works with the positions of the two scales reversed. We can have our 2 scales like 
this:
Figure 4.8

The Navigation Computer - Slide Rule Face
Or like this:
Figure 4.9  
Note: We can use it for dividing as well as multiplying, in the same way that we could use the 
linear scale for subtracting as well as adding.
When set up like this, we can divide 6 (top scale) by 2 (bottom scale), and read off the answer 
‘3’.

Multiplication
Before we can start using the Navigation Computer, we need to look at the scale.
From Figure 4.12, you can see that there is no number smaller than 10 or larger than 99.9. 
Therefore, we need to mentally insert the decimal point; for instance, the number 12 can be 
used to represent 0.12, 12, 120, 1200, etc. We put the decimal point in after the Navigation 
Computer operation.
This means that you have to carry out a rough calculation in your head to know what order of 
magnitude your solution will be.
Figure 4.12  No number smaller than 10 or greater than 99.9
An example should make this clear.
Suppose you have to multiply 11.5 by 2.54.
First, the approximate calculation.
This is approximately 10 (11.5) times approximately 2½ (2.54).
The answer will be approximately 25. It will not be 2½ or 250.
Now we know the order of magnitude of the solution, we can use the slide rule.
Against 11.5 on the outer scale, line up 10 (representing 1.0) on the inner scale - Figure 4.13.

Figure 4.13  Line up 11.5 (outer scale) with 1.0 (inner scale)
Now find 2.54 on the inner scale (shown as 25.4). Align the cursor (see Figure 4.14).
Read off the answer (29.2) on the outer scale.
Figure 4.14  Multiplication
Is this the correct order of magnitude? Is the answer 2.92, 29.2, or 292?
We know from our rough calculation that the answer is about 25. So 29.2 is the correct order 
of magnitude.

Division
Divide 3050 by 3.28.
Again, the rough calculation. This is approximately 3000 divided by approximately 3. The 
answer will be just under 1000, i.e. about nine hundred and something.
Find 3050 on the outer scale and align the cursor. Now find 3.28 on the inner scale and align it 
with the cursor. It should then look as in Figure 4.15 below.
Figure 4.15  Setting up for division
Now find 10 on the inner scale and read off against the outer scale, as in Figure 4.16 below.
Figure 4.16  Reading off the answer - division
The initial answer is 93.0. Is this the right order of magnitude? We know from our rough 
calculation that it should be about 900, so the correct answer must be 930.

Rates and Ratios
Let us reinforce the division process by doing another example. Placing it into an aviation-
related situation:-.
The average rate of climb of a particular aircraft is given as 700 feet per minute. How long 
will it take to climb from 3000 to 20 000 feet?
The aircraft is to climb through 17 000 feet at 700 feet per minute. Straightforward division of 
17 000 by 700 will determine the number of minutes for the climb.
What is the rough order of magnitude?
700 feet in one minute so...............................................
7 000 feet in ten minutes, and........................................
14 000 feet in twenty minutes; therefore.........................
17 000 feet in a few more minutes than twenty.............
Alternatively, 700 fpm is not too far from 1000 fpm. So the sum is approximately
17 000 / 1000, which will be a bit more than 17, i.e. somewhere in the low twenties.
Hold the computer with the 17 000 (shown as 17) of the outer scale at the top.
Rotate the disc to bring the 700 (shown as 7) of the inner scale immediately opposite the outer 
scale 17.
Turn the instrument the shortest way (clockwise in this case) to bring 10 of the inner scale to 
the top.
Opposite this ‘10’ read off from the outer scale the answer digits 243.
Which leads us to a final answer of 24.3 minutes.
You may prefer a slightly different approach to this type of problem, solving in terms of 
proportion rather than division. Restating the problem we have:-
Aircraft climbs 700 feet in one minute
It will climb 17 000 feet in ‘t’ minutes (where ‘t’ is the answer we wish to discover)
This can be written as:-
700
1
17 000
t
=
Now if you arrange this equation on your circular slide rule with the numerators 700 and 17 000 
on the outer scale set respectively above the denominators 1 and ‘t’ on the inner scale, the 
problem is solved.

Figure 4.17  700 fpm set up as a ratio
As shown in Figure 4.17, align the 700 (shown as 70) of the outer scale exactly over the 1 
(shown as 10) on the inner scale. This sets up the left hand side of the equation.
Figure 4.18  The solution as a ratio
Turn the instrument clockwise and look for the right hand side of the equation. Look for 17 000 
(shown as 17) on the outer scale.
Immediately under it, read off 24.3 from the inner scale.
This is the same answer that we had before. If you solve the problem in this manner, you still 
have to perform a rough mental calculation, as before, to position the decimal point correctly.
This proportioning, or ratio, technique is important. It is the basis of all distance, speed and 
time calculations and of fuel consumption calculations. We will return to it in the next lesson.

The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions
Introduction
In the last chapter, we saw how it was possible to use a proportioning, or ratio, technique on 
the Navigation Computer when dealing with problems of rates, i.e. quantities per minute or 
quantities per hour. The example we used was a rate of climb, which was expressed as 700 
feet per minute. By setting ‘700’ (outer scale) against ‘1’ (inner scale), we could read off the 
number of feet gained (outer scale) in 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, etc (inner scale).
Figure 5.1 700 fpm set up as a ratio 
The red arrow on the inner scale of the Navigation Computer is the indicator of ‘1’, and is used 
as the inner scale reference if the answer we want is in the same units. If the red arrow is used 
to indicate ‘1 minute’, then the answer will be in minutes (and decimals of a minute). This is 
useful if the rate is given in quantity per minute, as, for instance, rate of climb or descent usually 
is. If the red arrow is used to indicate ‘1 hour’, then the answer will be in hours and decimals of 
an hour. This may not be so useful, because few of us work in decimals of an hour. Usually, even 
if the rate is given ‘per hour’ we want the answer in minutes, or hours and minutes.
Figure 5.2 Base ‘1’ and Base ‘60’ Indices 
If this is the case - for instance, fuel flow is usually given in pounds (or kilograms) per hour but 
we usually want the answer in minutes or hours and minutes - then we put the ‘60’ index (the 
black triangular arrow) against the hourly rate. Suppose our fuel flow is 2000 kg/hour. Then by 
putting 60 minutes (inner scale) instead of one hour against 2000 (outer scale) we are dividing 
2000 by 60. If you now look at the red arrow you are getting the rate per minute (33.33 kg).

Figure 5.3 2000 kg/hour (black triangle) equals 33.3 kg/min (red arrow) 
Distance, Speed and Time
For distance, speed and time problems the outer scale is always distance or speed and the 
inner scale is always time.
Example.  How far do you go in 48 minutes at 120 knots ground speed?
First, set what you know. Set the ground 
speed. Bring the ‘60’ black triangle against 
120 knots on the outer scale.
Now find 48 minutes on the minutes (inner) 
scale. Read off the answer - 96 NM on the 
outer scale.
Figure 5.4 Finding distance from speed and time
--- Page 93 ---

The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions 
5
The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions
Example.  In 30 minutes you have covered 90 NM over the ground. What is your ground speed?
Set what you know on the computer. Set 30 
minutes (inner scale) against 90 NM (outer 
scale).
Now read off the ground speed against the 
‘60’ black triangle. The answer is 18.0.
What order of magnitude? At 18 knots, you 
would stall. At 1800 knots, you would strip the 
wings off. Common sense tells you that this 
must be 180 knots - which is the right answer.
Example.  Your ground speed is 220 knots and you have 57 NM to go. How long will it take 
you?
As before, set what you know. Move the black 
‘60’ triangle against 220 knots.
Now bring the cursor round to 57 NM (outer 
scale, because it is a distance).
Read off the time on the inner scale. The 
answer is 15.5. Are we expecting 15 minutes 
or 150 minutes? 57 NM is about a quarter of 
220, so about a quarter of an hour is obviously 
the right answer. It is 15.5 minutes.

The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions
The Yellow Scale
What is the purpose of the yellow scale? It is 
simply to allow you to convert from minutes 
to hours and minutes. If we use the ‘60’ black 
triangle for an hourly rate, we get the answer 
in minutes, even when it is in excess of one 
hour. Often, in aviation, we want the answer 
in hours and minutes.
Suppose an answer comes to 142.6 minutes. 
Looking at the yellow ring, you can see that 
this is between 2 hours and 2 hours 30 min. 
Therefore it must be 2 hours 22.6 min.
This is the sole purpose of the yellow scale
The Blue Scale
The blue scale gives the value of ram rise. Ram rise is the difference between Static Air 
Temperature (SAT) and Total Air Temperature (TAT).
	
	
	
	
Ram Rise   =   ( TAT - SAT )
Static Air Temperature is the temperature of the ambient atmosphere surrounding the aircraft 
with no inaccuracies caused by the measurement process. This is the temperature we need 
to calculate True Airspeed (TAS) from Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) and Pressure Altitude, or to 
calculate TAS from Mach No. However, what we measure with our temperature probe is the 
TAT, which is affected by compressibility and kinetic or adiabatic heating, and is always a higher 
temperature than the SAT.
A good approximation for the value of ram rise is:
Ram Rise    =                   where TAS is in knots
TAS
100
(
)
2
Thus, if the TAS is 400 knots, the ram rise is approximately 16°C, if the TAS is 500 the ram rise is 
approximately 25°C, and so on. However, although this approximation is usually good enough 
for most practical purposes, it tends to be slightly low and is not as accurate as the answer 
produced by the Navigation Computer, which is the one which will be expected for EASA ATPL 
examinations.

The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions

The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions
Suppose your TAS is 400 knots. Align the cursor 
with 400 knots (upper portion of blue scale). 
Read off the Ram Rise on the lower portion of 
the blue scale. It is about 17°C.
So, if the TAT at 400 knots TAS were, say, 
-22°C, then the SAT would be -39°C.
Fuel Consumption
Fuel consumption problems work exactly like distance/speed/time calculations. We normally 
get a fuel consumption per hour, use base 60, and read the answer in minutes. If it comes to 
more than 60 minutes we use the yellow scale to read the answer in hours and minutes.
Example.  Your fuel consumption is 2300 kg/hour. Your time to destination is 1 hour 37 minutes. 
How much fuel will you use?
Remember - minutes are always on the inner 
scale.
Set the black triangle against 2300. Align the 
cursor with 1 hour 37 minutes (97 minutes). 
Read off the answer - 37.2. The correct answer 
is obviously 3720 kg.
Using a calculator gives you the answer 
3718.33 kg. This should reassure you that the 
navigation computer is very accurate - in fact, 
probably considerably more accurate than 
your fuel gauges.

Example  Your fuel flow is 130 imperial gallons per hour. You have 380 gallons left above your 
reserves. What is your Safe Endurance?
Set the black triangle against 130.
Align the cursor with 380 (outer scale).
Read off the answer - 175.5 (inner scale). Use 
the yellow ring to see that this is 2 hours and 
55.5 minutes.
Example  You have used 3700 litres of fuel in the last 1 hour 45 minutes. What is your fuel 
consumption rate?
Find 3700 on the outer scale and align the 
cursor.
Bring 1 hour 45 minutes (105 minutes) on the 
minutes scale into alignment with the cursor. 
Use the yellow scale to convert hours and 
minutes to minutes if necessary.
Read off the consumption against the black 
‘60’ triangle.
The answer is 21.1. A common-sense check 
shows that this must be 2110 kg/hour.
The electronic calculator solution is 2114.29.

Distance Conversions
The Navigation Computer can also be used for distance, volume and weight conversions. 
Taking distance first:
Round the edge of the outer scale are various 
index marks with red labels. These 3 are for 
distance conversions:
Example:  Convert 148 kilometres to statute miles and to nautical miles.
The km-m-ltr index on the outer scale is at 10 
and the naut m index is at 54 (or 5.4). You 
should remember that the distance from the 
Equator to the pole is 10 000 km and is also (90 
× 60), i.e. 5400 nautical miles. So 10 000 km = 
5400 NM and 10 km = 5.4 NM.
Align 148 on the inner scale with the km- m-ltr 
index.

miles

--- Page 98 ---
The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions

92
5
The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions
Now move the cursor to the naut m index. 
Read off the answer 8.0 (on the inner scale) - 
which must be 80 NM.
To get the answer in statute miles, now move the cursor to the stat m index and read off 92.
Always remember to read the answer off the inner scale.
A common mistake is to read these conversion answers off the outer scale and then to wonder 
why they are always the same - 54 NM and 62.5 stat.m.
Now do one for metres, yards and feet:
Example:  Convert 256 metres to yards and feet.
Set on what you know:-
Opposite the m (metres and 10) index on the outer scale, set 256 (which is 25.6) on the inner 
scale. 
Then, opposite the yards index on the outer scale read off 28.0 (obviously 280). 
Against the feet index on the outer scale, read off 84.0 (obviously 840) on the inner scale.
256 metres  =  280 yards  =  840 feet.

Volume Conversions
You can also do volume conversions.
These are the litres, imperial gallons and U.S. 
gallons index marks.
Example:  Convert 136 litres to imperial and to US gallons.
As always, set what you know on the navigation computer.
  	
 Put 136 against the litres index    	
         Read off against the imp.gal index
Figure 5.16  136 against the litres index

Figure 5.18  Reading off the u.s. gal index
This gives 36 US gallons
You need to remember that there are about 4½ litres to an imperial gallon and that there are 
5 imperial galls to 6 US gallons in order to get the order of magnitude right.
Volume to Weight
There is also a facility on the Navigation Computer to convert volume in litres or gallons to 
weight in kilograms or pounds if you know the specific gravity of the liquid (usually fuel). These 
indices have been spaced so that you can begin with an argument in one set of units and read 
off the answer in the other units.
A little revision on specific gravity may be useful here. Specific gravity (also known as ‘relative 
density’) is the density compared with the density of water. One litre of water weighs ONE 
kilogram in the metric system and one imperial gallon of water weighs TEN pounds in the 
imperial system. For example, if a fuel has a specific gravity of 0.80, then one litre weighs 0.80 
kg and one imp.gal weighs 8.0 pounds.
The calorific value of fuel is related to its mass, not its volume. You need a greater volume of 
fuel at a lower SG to give the same amount of energy as a smaller volume at a higher SG. This 
energy may be expressed as range in nautical air miles, or possibly as endurance. Thus, 200 
litres at .80 SG weighs 160 kg. If fuel at .75 SG is used, then 213 litres will be needed to cover 
the same distance.

The Navigation Computer - Distance, Speed, Time and Conversions
Let us do the ‘pounds weight’ conversion first.
Without moving the inner scale, which is 
already set up as you require, move the cursor 
to 0.80 specific gravity on the Sp.G lbs scale. 
This scale is marked from 70 to 95, representing 
SGs of 0.70 to 0.95.
Read off 20.0 on the inner scale.
What is the order of magnitude? Remember, 
we are dealing with 250 imp.gal. Remember, 
the SG is 0.8. Therefore we are expecting an 
answer of about 2000 lb.
In this case, the answer is exactly 2000 lb.
Now, the conversion to kilograms.
Again, we do not move the inner scale.
Move the cursor to 0.80 on the Sp.G kgs scale. 
The scale is marked for 70 to 90, representing 
SGs of 0.70 to 0.90.
Read off 9.08 on the inner scale.
What is the order of magnitude?
There are various ways you can estimate 
this. Either 1135 litres times .8 is about 900 
kg, or 2000 lb is going to be just under 1000 
kilograms.
Therefore the answer is 908 kg.

The Navigation Computer can also be used for the following functions:

•	 Calculation of TAS from Mach Number
•	 Calculation of True Altitude from Indicated Altitude
•	 Calculation of Density Altitude from Pressure Altitude
Airspeed Indicator Errors - Application of Corrections
Figure 6.1 overleaf is a breakdown of the corrections to the airspeed indicator (ASI) and the 
order in which they are applied.
What you see on the instrument is called Indicated Airspeed (IAS). Instrument Error and 
Pressure (or Position) Error are then applied to give Calibrated  Airspeed (CAS). This is the 
more modern and generally accepted term, but many documents use the older term Rectified 
Airspeed (RAS). The corrections are applied by use of a correction card usually stuck beside 
the instrument.
In practice, we do not have separate cards for the Instrument Error and the Pressure Error. It 
is simpler to combine both corrections onto a single card. IAS is therefore corrected for both 
Instrument and Pressure Error by the correction card, to give CAS.
Strictly speaking, CAS is then corrected for compressibility error to give Equivalent Airspeed 
(EAS), to allow for the fact that the density of air is rarely precisely 1225 grams per cubic metre, 
which is the value for which the ASI is calibrated. (The ISA atmosphere at Mean Sea Level). 
In practice, as an airline pilot, you are unlikely to deal with EAS and it is rarely encountered 
outside scientific and test flying. The ASI is already calibrated to allow for compressibility at ISA 
at MSL and, under those conditions, no compressibility correction is necessary. Compressibility 
correction is small at True  Airspeeds (TAS) lower than 300 knots and no correction is considered 
necessary.
You will therefore always calculate the Density Error correction first to give True Airspeed 
(TAS). If the TAS you find is 300 knots or less, no further correction is necessary. If the TAS is 
greater than 300 knots, Compressibility Error correction must be applied.

Calculation of TAS from CAS - Correction of Density Error
To correct CAS to TAS we need to divide by the square root of the relative density. You will 
recall this formula from Phase 1:
	
	
	
CAS    =   TAS √ relative density 
Relative to what? The answer is that it is relative to ISA at Mean Sea Level, i.e. 1225 gram per 
cubic metre. Look at Figure 6.2 below, which is a table of standard values of the ISA atmosphere.

Figure 6.2  Values for the ISA standard atmosphere
Imagine that we are flying at 100 knots CAS at FL200 in an ISA atmosphere. The density at that 
level is 653 gram per cubic metre. To calculate the relative density:
	
	
	
relative density    =                =     .5331
653 
1225
Therefore:
	
	
	
√relative density    =    √.5331   =    .7301
So, with a CAS of 100 knots, TAS    =                 =     137 knots
100 
.7301
If we had an instrument which measured the density of the air we are flying through, we could 
calculate our TAS in this way. But, in fact, there is no flight deck instrument which gives such a 
reading.
However, you should remember from your Principles of Flight lectures that:
	
	
	
P   
Tr
P   
T
=     constant     or     r    ∝
where P = pressure, T = temperature and r = density
So, if we know any two of Pressure, Density and Temperature, we can find the other one.

The Navigation Computer - TAS and Altitude Conversions
You should also remember from your Piston Engine lectures that:
The “Combined Gas Law” is a combination of Boyle’s law and Charles’ Law and represents the 
relationship between Volume, Pressure and Temperature.
This may be shown as:
	
	
P × V 
T
	=   K	
	
or, alternatively	
	
P × V   =   K × T
	
	
Or 	
P2 × V2 
T2
P1 × V1 
T1 
=
	
We do have an instrument that gives us the Temperature - the air thermometer. We have to 
correct from Total Air Temperature to Static Air Temperature, but we know how to do that.
We also have an instrument that gives us the atmospheric pressure at our level - the altimeter. 
As we know, it does not actually measure altitude, but pressure. The altimeter is, in fact, a 
form of barometer, but the readout is in feet. However, the law relating altitude in the ISA 
atmosphere to hectopascals of pressure is known, and we can use it.
So, we can use pressure from the altimeter and temperature from the thermometer to find the 
relative density, and then find TAS from CAS. If you tried to do this longhand with a calculator, 
it would take quite a long time. However, the Navigation Computer uses precisely this method, 
and does it quickly and easily.
Let us now return to our previous example:
CAS = 100 knots      FL200
SAT = -25       Density = 653 g/m3
On the Navigation Computer, we have the 
4 windows marked AIRSPEED, COMP CORR, 
ALTITUDE and DENSITY ALTITUDE.

The Navigation Computer - TAS and Altitude Conversions
In the  AIRSPEED window, align FL200 against 
-25°C.
This has altered the position of the inner scale 
relative to the outer scale. You have aligned 
them up in the ratio of the square root of the 
relative density. If you want to check this, look 
at the ‘1’ (shown as ‘10’) on the outer scale. 
Against it, on the inner scale, you will see the 
ratio .7301.
You now have CAS on the inner scale against 
TAS on the outer scale. As our theoretical 
explanation on page 107 showed, 100 knots 
CAS at FL200 and -25°C is 137 knots TAS.
You do not require to know, or understand, the theoretical explanation. All that is required is 
to be able to use the Navigation Computer practically.

Another example, just using the Navigation Computer method:
You are at 18 000 feet pressure altitude and the SAT (corrected outside air temperature) is 
-30°C. CAS (RAS) is 170 knots. What is TAS?
In the  AIRSPEED window set pressure altitude 
(18 000 feet) against COAT (-30°C ).
Find 170 knots CAS on the inner scale.
Move the cursor if you need to.
Now read off the value on the outer scale (220 
knots TAS).

Correction of Compressibility Error
The ASI is calibrated to allow for compressibility at an atmospheric pressure of 1225 grams per 
cubic metre (ISA at MSL), but at any other density (nearly always), compressibility error must 
be corrected.
Compressibility correction is insignificant at airspeeds less than 300 knots TAS, but must be 
applied if the initial calculation gives a TAS of more than 300 knots.
Example: Flight Level 350, COAT = -47°C, CAS = 280 knots. What is TAS?
Start by calculating TAS from CAS in the usual 
way.
In the AIRSPEED window, set FL350 against 
-47°C.
Find 280 knots CAS on the inner scale.
Now read off the value on the outer scale (500 
knots TAS).

The Navigation Computer - TAS and Altitude Conversions
This is more than 300 knots TAS. So how do we correct for compressibility?
Under the COMP CORR window you will see the equation here:
	
	
- 3 DIV
Divide the initial TAS (500 in this case) by 100 and subtract 3.
	
	
- 3   =   2.0
Now, in the COMP CORR window, move the arrow 2 divisions to the left. 
From here:
To here:
This has moved the inner scale to the left, altering the relationship of CAS to TAS, correcting it 
for compressibility.

The Navigation Computer - TAS and Altitude Conversions
Now read off the new value of TAS on the 
outer scale corresponding to 280 knots CAS 
on the inner scale.
This gives a revised TAS of 480 knots.
Calculation of TAS from Mach Number
Finding TAS from Mach Number is easier than from CAS because there is only one variable - 
temperature - and no correction for compressibility.
There are 2 methods - a formula, or the Navigation Computer method
The formula is as follows:
	
	
TAS = Mach No × 38.95 √ T°  K
0 K is -273.16°C, though -273°C is a good enough approximation.
Example:
	
	
COAT  =  -47°C	  Mach No.  =  0.82	
What is the TAS?
	
	
-47°C   =   (273 - 47)   =   226K
	
	
TAS   =   0.82  ×  38.95  ×  √226  =   480 knots
Now we will do the same calculation using the 
Navigation Computer:-
Move the AIRSPEED window round until the 
Mach No. index appears.

Set the COAT of -47°C 
against the index arrow.
This has set up a relationship between Mach 
No. on the inner scale and TAS on the outer 
scale.
Read off the TAS of 482 on the outer scale 
against the Mach no. of .82 on the inner scale.

Calculation of True Altitude from Indicated Altitude and Temperature
The altimeter is calibrated against an ISA atmosphere, so a particular set of values of temperature 
is assumed. If the temperatures on the day at the various levels of the atmosphere are different 
from ISA, the indicated value will not correspond to true altitude. At higher levels this is not 
a problem since all aircraft experience the same temperature error in the same part of the 
atmosphere and can still maintain vertical separation from each other. However, when close to 
the ground it is necessary to know true altitude in order to maintain terrain clearance.
If the other altimeter corrections have been made (position error, instrument error) and the 
correct QNH is set, the indicated error differs from the true altitude by temperature error. This 
can be corrected either by use of a formula or with the Navigation Computer.
The formula is as follows:
 ISA Deviation 
273
True Altitude   =   Indicated Altitude  +                                ×  Indicated Altitude
(
(
However, if you treat 1/273 as 1/250, then you can write it as 4/1000. This is the basis of the
“4% rule” used in Meteorology.
True Altitude  =  Indicated Altitude  +  (ISA Deviation  ×  
4   
1000    ×  Indicated Altitude)
Example: Indicated Altitude is 20 000 feet. SAT is -35°C. What is True Altitude?
ISA at FL200 is -25°C, so our SAT of -35°C is ISA -10°C.
Substituting into the above equation:
	
	
True Altitude = 20 000 + ( - 10   ×   
4   
1000    ×   20 000)
	
	
True Altitude = 20 000 + ( - 800 ) = 19 200 feet
This corresponds to what you would expect. 
The column of air is 10°C colder than ISA. 
This means that it is denser air. Therefore, the 
pressure reduces more rapidly than ISA as you 
climb through the atmosphere because there 
are fewer feet to a hectopascal with denser 
air. So you will pass through the required 
number of hectopascals needed to give an 
indication of 20 000 feet in less than 20 000 
feet True Altitude.
However, it is rather easier with the Navigation 
Computer. We carry out the correction using 
the ALTITUDE window.

The Navigation Computer - TAS and Altitude Conversions
Using the same example, in the ALTITUDE 
window, align 20 000 feet with the SAT 
of -35°C. By doing this, you have set up a 
relationship between the inner and the outer 
scales.
The outer scale now shows the True Altitude 
corresponding to the Indicated Altitude on 
the inner scale.
Against 20 000 feet (Indicated Altitude) on the 
inner scale, read 19 200 feet (True Altitude) on 
the outer scale.
In any question which requires you to correct Indicated Altitude to True Altitude, the Navigation 
Computer should always give an accurate answer and there is no need to use the formula. In 
addition, you can use the ambient temperature directly and there is no need to calculate ISA 
deviation. True Altitude questions should, therefore, always be solved by use of the Navigation 
Computer.

Calculation of Density Altitude from Pressure Altitude and Temperature
Density Altitude has nothing to do with vertical distance. It is a measure of aircraft performance. 
Density Altitude is the altitude in the ISA atmosphere which corresponds to the density which 
you are experiencing in your current ambient atmosphere. It affects aircraft performance and 
engine power.	Most manufacturers quote a declared performance in terms of Density Altitude. 
Most performance graphs already allow for this correction in the entering arguments to the 
graph, but if yours does not, you need to be able to calculate it.
As before, there are 2 methods of solving the problem - the formula and the use of the 
Navigation Computer.
The formula is as follows:
	
Density Altitude = Pressure Altitude + (ISA Deviation × 120)
(Strictly speaking, the conversion factor should be 118.8, not 120, but 120 is close enough)
Example:
You are at Nairobi, pressure altitude 5500 feet. SAT is +35°C. What is Density Altitude?
ISA at FL5.5 is +4°C, so our SAT of +35°C is ISA +31°C.
Substituting into the above equation:
Density Altitude = 5500 + ( + 31 × 120 )
Density Altitude = 5500 + ( 3720 ) = 9220
Now try the same problem on the Navigation Computer.
This one is not so obvious because you start off with the AIRSPEED window.

The Navigation Computer - TAS and Altitude Conversions
Set 5500 feet against +35°C.
Now look in the DENSITY ALTITUDE window.
Read off the answer of 9200 feet.
Unfortunately, the divisions on the Navigation 
Computer DENSITY ALTITUDE window are 
rather small and it can sometimes be difficult 
to separate closely spaced ATPL examination 
answer 
options. 
With 
Density 
Altitude 
calculations, unlike True Altitude, it may 
sometimes be necessary to use the formula 
rather than the Navigation Computer to get a 
sufficiently accurate answer.

The Wind Face of the Navigation Computer
We have completed all aspects of the slide rule face of the Navigation Computer and we now 
turn our attention to the wind face. However, before we do so we must define some terms, 
and then discuss the effect of wind on navigation, and introduce the concept of the Triangle 
of Velocities.
Some Definitions
Heading is the direction in which the aircraft is pointing. This is not necessarily the direction 
in which it is tracking over the ground. As we shall shortly see, if there is any crosswind 
component, there will be a difference between the direction in which the aircraft is pointing 
and the direction in which it is travelling.
Heading is defined as the direction in which the fore and aft axis of the aircraft is pointing; it 
may be measured from True, Magnetic, or Compass North.
Track is the direction of the aircraft’s path over the ground. It may be measured from True 
or Magnetic North.
Drift is the difference between heading and track. You always drift from your heading to your 
track. Thus, if your heading is 090°(T) and your track is 097°(T), you are drifting to the right 
(from heading to track). If your heading is 030°(T) and your track is 026°(T), you are drifting to 
the left. Have a look at the diagram of the Triangle of Velocities at Figure 7.4 of this chapter. It 
shows drift to the right.
Wind Correction Angle (WCA).  Wind Correction Angle is the same value as drift but it is 
applied in the opposite sense.  In the paragraph above, the heading is 090° and the track is 
097° which means the drift angle is 7° right or starboard i.e. added to the heading to give track. 
The WCA in this example would be -7° i.e. applied to the track to give heading.
Port and Starboard. Most countries, and certainly the USA, use the terms ‘left’ and ‘right’ 
in aviation. However, the British retain an affection for their maritime tradition and so use 
the terms ‘Port’ and ‘Starboard’ when referring either to the left or right side of the aircraft 
(looking forwards) or when referring to drift. ‘Port’ is left (easy to remember - ‘Port’ has 4 
letters and so does ‘left’). ‘Starboard’ is right.
Course is a word that can lead to enormous confusion. Early British terminology used ‘course’ to 
mean heading - the direction in which the aircraft is pointing. This practice ceased around 1950, 
when ‘heading’ became the accepted UK term. However, many present American publications 
use the word ‘course’ to mean track - the direction of the aircraft’s path over the ground.
Because of this potential for confusion, we will not use the word ‘course’. The unambiguous 
words ‘heading’ and ‘track’ will always be used. However, the word course may sometimes be 
used in formal examinations to mean ‘desired track’.

The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
The Effect of Wind
Aircraft do not always travel in the direction in which they are pointed. If there is any cross- 
wind, the track will be different from the heading. We will start by explaining this in terms of 
a boat crossing a river.
Imagine a river 10 NM wide. Imagine that it has a current of 5 knots.
Figure 7.1 River with current
10 NM
If you stand at Point A and throw a stick into the river, after one hour it will have been carried 
5 NM downstream.
Now imagine that the river has been dammed, and has become a lake. There is now no current 
and the water is still. This time, you are at Point A with a boat with an outboard motor and a 
speed of 10 knots through the water. If you set off from Point A to cross directly to the opposite 
bank, one hour later you will be at Point B.
Figure 7.2 Triangle of velocities - boat crossing river
5 NM
10 NM
10 NM
Now combine these two ideas. The dam is removed and the lake has become a river again. We 
have our 5 knots current back. We set off in our boat from Point A heading towards Point B. 
However, the effect of the current is to take us downstream, as before, and this time we finish 
up at Point C, 10 miles across the river and 5 miles downstream. Note that we pointed the boat
--- Page 133 ---
7
127
The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
7
The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
(heading) towards B, but have actually travelled (track) to C. If we want to finish up at Point B, 
we need to aim off to the left towards Point D.
This is a continuous process. If we head towards Point B, after, say, 12 minutes (1/5th of an 
hour), we will be 2 miles across the river and one mile displaced to the right. After 24 minutes, 
we will be 4 miles across the river and 2 miles downstream, and so on. The boat tracks along 
the vector AC.
Exactly the same process takes place with aircraft travelling through the air. On a day when 
the air is completely calm (analogous to the lake), the aircraft tracks where it is pointed. We 
get completely calm days about 6 times a year. However, we still have to be able to navigate 
on the other 359, so we need to be able to take account of wind, or moving air (analogous to 
the river).
This term ‘wind’ tends to suggest something transient and many newcomers to aviation find 
it hard to imagine that something so unsubstantial could have such an effect on such a dense 
massive aircraft as, say, a Boeing 747, or a dense fast moving aircraft such as a Tornado. This is 
why this chapter uses this rather elaborate analogy of the river. It is easy to imagine a boat or 
a twig being carried downstream by a 10 mile expanse of river moving at 5 knots. However, 
wind is not simply little puffy transient eddies of air. Wind is the continuous movement of an 
air mass.
An air mass is a large homogenous body of air travelling over the ground - we normally do not 
regard it as an air mass unless it is at least, say, 60 NM by 60 NM in size. This whole air mass 
travels over the ground, just like the river. Your aircraft is supported by this broad mass of air in 
just the same way as the boat or the twig is supported by the river and it therefore travels in it 
just as the twig travels in the river.
The Triangle of Velocities
Accordingly, we have to take account of this movement of air when we navigate and this 
problem is solved by constructing a vector triangle of velocities. The components are always 
the same:
The Air Vector: The Air Vector consists of Heading and True Airspeed (TAS). TAS is the true 
(not indicated) speed of the aircraft through the air, and it is the speed that the aircraft would 
travel over the ground if there were no wind. The Air Vector is always drawn with one direction 
arrow.
The Wind Vector: The Wind Vector consists of Wind Direction and Wind Speed. Wind direction 
is always given in terms of the direction that the wind has come from, not where it is blowing 
to. Thus a wind vector like this:
Figure 7.3 Wind vector
--- Page 134 ---
The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
7
128
7
The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
indicates a wind direction of 330°(T), not 150°(T). (This does actually correspond to the way 
that we normally discuss wind direction in everyday speech. A South wind is warm because it 
has blown up from Morocco, a West wind is warm and wet because it has blown across the 
Atlantic and over Ireland, etc.). The Wind Vector is always drawn with 3 direction arrows.
The Ground Vector. The Ground Vector is drawn by joining up the Air Vector and the Wind 
Vector. The resultant vector is Track and Ground Speed. The Ground Vector is always drawn 
with 2 direction arrows.
Figure 7.4 is a diagram of the Triangle of Velocities. In practice, pilots do not normally draw it 
out to scale on graph paper, but solve it using an analogue navigation computer. However, as 
we are just about to find out, the Navigation Computer is merely a device for quickly producing 
a scale drawing and is actually drawing the Triangle of Velocities for you.
Figure 7.4 Triangle of velocities
A Practical Example
Take the following situation: 
You are in a Warrior PA 28. 
TAS is 100 knots.
Heading of 000°(T).
The forecast W/V is 240/30.
What will be your track and ground speed?

The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities

The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
Start by drawing out your Triangle of Velocities.
On a piece of paper (graph paper, ideally), draw in the Air Vector. It will have a direction of 
000°(T) and a vector length equivalent to 100 knots (say, 100 mm).
Figure 7.5 The air vector
Now draw in the Wind Vector. It was 240/30.
Remember, it is from 240°. It will actually point in the direction 060°(T).
Whatever units you used in proportion to 100 knots TAS (100 mm), draw the length of the 
Wind Vector in the same units (30 mm).
Figure 7.6 The air vector 
and the wind vector
Now join the start of the Air Vector to the end of the Wind Vector to establish the resultant 
– the Ground Vector:-

The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
Figure 7.7 The complete 
triangle of velocities
When you do that on your piece of graph paper, if you measure the track with a protractor you 
will find that it is 012° and if you measure the length of the ground vector you will find a vector 
length equivalent to 118 knots.
What this is telling you is that if you fly a heading of 000°(T) at a TAS of 100 knots in a wind of 
240/30, your path over the ground will actually be a track of 012°(T) at a ground speed of 118 
knots.
It would be a bit long-winded if every time you wanted to fly, you had to start doing little scale 
drawings on graph paper. There has to be a quicker way. There is. It is called the Navigation 
Computer - but using the Wind Face this time.
Solving the Same Problem on the Navigation Computer
Same situation:
You are in a Warrior PA 28.
TAS is 100 knots.
Heading of 000°(T).

The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
Start off by putting the W/V on the Navigation 
Computer.
Rotate the wind face to bring 240 up to the 
index (the 12 o’clock position).
Put any convenient datum to measure from 
(say 100 knots) under the blue circle in the 
centre of the wind face. (Alternatively, you 
can use the ‘graph paper’ square grid at the 
bottom of the slide).
Now plot downwards (in the 6 o’clock 
direction).
Mark off 30 knots on the wind face. We 
recommend that you use a soft pencil. You can 
use a felt-tip pen PROVIDED that it is water-
based (non-permanent) ink (pens with grey 
barrels). DO NOT use spirit-based (permanent) 
pens (with black barrels).
That is the Wind Vector plotted. Now for the 
Air Vector.
Rotate the wind disc to put the Heading (000°) 
against the true heading index (12 o’clock 
position)
Move the slide to put your TAS (100 knots) 
under the blue circle in the centre.
It should now look like this.

ground speed

The Navigation Computer - Triangle of Velocities
Now look where the wind mark is positioned. It is about 12 degrees right of the centre line. This 
means that you have 12 degrees of starboard drift. Your heading is 000°, so your track is 012°.
The ground speed is obtained by reading it off against the radial arcs. In the above example, 
it is 118 knots.
These are the same answers that we got by scale drawing.
All that the Navigation Computer has done is to produce an analogue model of our scale 
drawing.
Figure 7.10 The triangle of velocities on the face of the navigation computer
The centre line is the Air Vector, pointing 000°, with a length of 100 knots TAS.
It is joined to the Wind Vector, which you have plotted downwind yourself.
The resultant vector, which connects the start of the Air Vector to the end of the Wind Vector, 
is the Ground Vector. It tracks up the 12° starboard drift line to give Track direction and ground 
speed vector length.

The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding
Uses of the Wind Face
In the previous chapter we showed how, given heading, TAS and a forecast wind, we could use 
the wind face of the Navigation Computer to calculate the resulting track and ground speed. 
In fact, there are several operations that can be carried out using the wind face. Three of the 
most common are tabulated below:

Wind finding (the found wind 
will be more recent and more 
local than a forecast W/V)
Application of Finding Track
Finding track, when given heading, as in the last chapter is the simplest operation, though not 
the one most generally used, and you may have thought that the reason we show it is because 
it is the simplest one to use to explain the Triangle of Velocities, but has no practical operation. 
This is not true; its practical use can occur as follows:
Suppose that you are on some pre-planned track, for instance, on airway R123 between 
Brookman’s Park and Clacton. You have used your Navigation Computer to calculate the desired 
heading to maintain the track (we have not covered how you do this yet, but that follows 
shortly) and you still have the forecast W/V marked up on your Navigation Computer. Then, 
because of a conflict of tracks with other traffic, ATC gives you a mandatory radar heading of 
030°T, taking you temporarily off the airway at time 1003. You make a note of your VOR/DME 
position at the time.
Figure 8.1 Mandatory radar heading off the airway
After a while, the conflict is resolved and 1009 at ATC inform you that “You are cleared own 
navigation to Clacton”. At just that moment, the VOR unlocks. You have no area navigation 
equipment. How are you going to find the required track to Clacton?

The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding
Answer: You use your Navigation Computer. You should have the forecast wind (let us say 
315/15) marked up on the wind face from when you were flight planning before the flight. Put 
your TAS (say, 160 knots) under the centre circle, set the heading of 030° and read off the drift 
and ground speed, exactly as in the last lesson. This gives 5° starboard drift, making a track of 
035°(T), and a ground speed of 157 knots.
From the position you noted at 1003, draw a track line of 035°(T) on your chart. You have gone 
6 minutes (one-tenth of an hour) at 157 knots ground speed, so that is 15.7 nautical miles. That 
is your best estimate of position (known as a “dead reckoning” or “DR” position and shown by 
the following symbol: 
).
Figure 8.2 Calculating the DR position
From the DR position draw a straight line to Clacton. That is your new desired track.
The purpose of this last example is to make the point that there are occasions where you need 
to be able to calculate track from a given heading, not the other (more common) way round. 
You will be tested on all 3 Navigation Computer operations in the ATPL examination and you 
need to be completely familiar with all 3 and to be able to distinguish the use of one from the 
other.
Solving for Heading and Ground Speed
Chapter 7 showed how, if you are given the heading, the TAS, and the W/V, you can find your 
track and ground speed. The first few pages of this chapter showed the practical use of this 
and how you can use this when held on a fixed heading.
However, the most common requirement in navigation and planning is finding the heading 
to fly. In planning a trip, you will join up your turning points on a map using a ruler and then 
measure the track of the straight line. This means that you already know your track. What you 
need to know is the heading to fly, because the wind will probably cause some drift. It is the 
reverse of the problem we solved earlier.
So let us see how you use the Navigation Computer, given track, to find the heading to fly.

Take this example:
You are in an aircraft with a planned TAS of 146 knots. The forecast W/V is 315/20.
You need to fly a track of 040°(T).
What is the heading to fly, and what will your ground speed be?
Start off by plotting the wind on in the usual way. It is 315/20.
Figure 8.3 Plotting a wind of 315/20
Now put the TAS (146 knots) under the blue circle and rotate the central disc round to put the 
desired track (040°) against the 12 o’clock index.
--- Page 148 ---
The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding

142
8
The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding
This will show a drift of 8 degrees starboard, like this:
Figure 8.4   Heading 040°, TAS 146, drift 8° starboard
What this is telling you is that if you fly a HEADING of 040°, you will experience 8° starboard 
drift and fly a TRACK of 048°.
You want to fly a TRACK of 040°. So what heading do you need? 
If a heading of 040° gives you 8° starboard drift, try aiming off 8° to the left and seeing if the 
drift changes. Try a heading of 032°.
Rotate the disc to put 032° under the 12 o’clock index and check to see whether the drift 
has changed. Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not. It depends on the geometry of your 
particular triangle of velocities.

The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding
Figure 8.5   Adjusting the heading to give the desired track
The drift is still 8° starboard. This means that we have solved the problem. With a heading of 
032° and 8° starboard drift, we get a track of 040° - which is what we wanted.
Now there is just one final thing to do - establish what the ground speed will be.
Figure 8.6   Indication of ground speed
You can now see that the ground speed will be 143 knots.

The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding
Changing Drift
Whether the drift changes from your initial attempt at a heading (040° in our last example) to 
your final heading which gives you the right answer (032° in our last example) depends on the 
geometry of your triangle of velocities. In the last example, the drift did not change. It was 8° 
starboard in both cases.
An example of a heading change which gives no change of drift is shown below.
Figure 8.7   Heading change but no drift change
However, in the example below (Figure 8.8), the heading change, with the same wind, gives 
a change of drift. The drift in the diagram on the right is obviously smaller. It just depends on 
how big the wind vector is compared to the air vector, how large the heading change is, and 
the initial value of the angle between wind and heading.

Balancing the Drift
Take the situation:
TAS = 76 knots
Desired Track = 230°
Forecast W/V = 110/40
Start in the usual way. Plot the W/V of 110/40.
Put the blue centre circle onto the TAS point 
of 76 knots.
Now bring the desired track of 230° up to the 
top.
Now observe that the drift under the wind point is 20° starboard and rotate the disc 20° 
clockwise to bring the desired track of 230° against 20° on the DRIFT STBD scale.
Look at the wind point. The drift has increased to 25° starboard so rotate the disc 5° clockwise 
to bring 230° against 25° on the DRIFT STBD scale. Check the drift again. It is now 27°S.

The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding
Rotate the disc a further 2° clockwise so that track 230° is against 27° on the DRIFT STBD scale. 
Check the wind point again. The drift is still 27° S. Check that 76 is still exactly under the centre 
dot (the blue circle). 
Read off true heading 203° against the TRUE HEADING index and ground speed 87 knots from 
under the wind point.

required):
1.	
Mark in wind dot.
2.	
Set true track at true heading index.
3.	
Set TAS under centre dot.
THE COMPUTER IS NOW SET UP INCORRECTLY, TRACK IS SET AT THE HEADING INDEX. THE

Practice Flight Plan
We now bring together those Navigation Computer facilities on both the Slide Rule face and 
the Wind face which are needed to complete a flight plan.
In all of the following exercises, work across the rows, row by row. Do not do them column 
by column. Doing it by rows makes you think about each individual operation and what it is 
that you are trying to achieve. Doing it by columns just turns it into a no-thought mechanical 
exercise.

The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding
Wind Finding
A pilot needs to know what wind is affecting his aircraft in flight at his particular level. This 
knowledge is available from the meteorological forecast, but the problem with forecasts is 
that they cover a large area and their period of validity extends over several hours. They can, 
therefore, only be a general guide for your area. If you want to find out exactly what wind is 
affecting you in your local area at the present time, the Navigation Computer can be used to 
find the wind.
Take the following situation:
You are heading 060°(T) at a TAS on 140 knots, in order to fly some planned track.
Figure 8.12   Heading 060°(T)
Once airborne, you get a fix at B, say 20 minutes after passing over a known landmark A.
You measure the track angle from A to B on your chart and find that it is 065°(T).
You also measure the distance A to B on your chart and find that it is 40 nautical miles.
If you have flown 40 NM in 20 minutes, your ground speed must be 120 knots.
You now know the following:
Heading	
=    060°(T)
TAS    	 	
=    140 knots
Track	 	
=    065°(T)
Ground speed	=    120 knots
Your triangle of velocities looks like this (Figure 8.13):

The Navigation Computer - Calculation of Heading and Wind Finding
Figure 8.13   The Complete Triangle of Velocities
What is the wind velocity?
On your Navigation Computer, put the heading 060° against the heading index and the TAS of 
140 knots against the blue circle.
The track is 065°, which means you have 5° starboard drift. Make a mark where the 5° S line 
crosses 120 knots ground speed.
This is the wind point.

Your triangle of velocities looks like this:
Now we need to measure the wind.
You can see from the wind face in its present 
position that the wind direction is from about 
030° and that the wind strength is about 20 
knots.

However, we need to measure it a bit more accurately than this.
This is the only reason we rotate the wind vector - to measure it more accurately.
Rotate the wind cross to the 6 o’clock position. You can now read the direction accurately from 
the 12 o’clock index.
You can also read the length of the wind 
vector accurately.
So the W/V is, in this example, 034°/23 knots.
This is the wind that has affected you over the 
last 20 minutes. It will be far more recent and 
far more local than any area met forecast.

Further Uses of the Wind Face
There are 2 other applications of the wind face which can be of use to pilots. One is finding 
winds from measuring drift only, not ground speed. This is called “multi-drift winds”. The other 
is the use of the Navigation Computer to establish head/tailwind and crosswind components. 
The technique could well be of practical use to a pilot operating in a basic environment without 
sophisticated navigation aids.
Multi-drift Winds
Experienced pilots can often assess their drift with considerable accuracy just by estimation of 
the angle between their heading and the angle that a particular object on the ground makes 
as it appears to track underneath their aircraft at low altitude. Bush pilots and maritime patrol 
pilots, in particular, tend to develop this skill with experience. However, it is very difficult to 
assess ground speed quickly, except by timing the rate of DME distance change over a short 
period, and this only works when tracking directly towards or away from the DME, which 
may not always be the case. The alternative is using a stopwatch over a short precalculated 
distance, but this requires detailed preflight preparation and is not usually practicable.
However, it is possible to find a W/V by use of drift only, though it requires the pilot to fly on 
2, or preferably, 3 headings which cut at a large angle to each other. This technique is known 
as the “multi-drift wind”.
The best multi-drift winds come from a 3-heading check, with the headings at 60° to each 
other. We will assume that a pilot is flying an initial heading of 030° at a TAS of 120 knots and 
decides that he needs an update of the W/V. He therefore assesses his drift on his present 
heading, then turns 60° left and makes another drift assessment, then turns 120° right for a 
third drift assessment. He then returns to his original heading. He notes the drift in each case 
and comes up with the following summary:-
Heading
Drift
030°
10°P
330°
5°P
090°
5°P
On the wind face of the Navigation Computer, rotate the heading to 030° and ensure that the 
TAS of 120 knots is under the centre dot. Then, using a straight-edge, draw a line along the 
whole length of the 10°P drift line.

Figure 9.1 Draw in the 10°P drift line
Now rotate the heading to the second reading of 330°. Ensuring that you still have 120 knots 
TAS under the centre dot, plot in the drift on this heading. In our example, it is 5°P. There is no 
need this time to draw the line along the whole wind face. You just need to have a small cross-
cut – say, 1 cm either side, as follows.
Figure 9.2 Draw in the second drift line
Now rotate the heading to the third reading of 090°. Ensuring that you still have 120 knots TAS 
under the centre dot, plot in the drift on this heading. In our example, it is 5°P again.

If the drifts have been assessed correctly, the third line should lie over or very near the other 
two, like this:-
Figure 9.3 Plotting the final line
If the 3 lines do not coincide, a triangle will be formed by the intersection. This triangle is 
known as the “cocked hat”. The size of the triangle is an indication of the accuracy of the drift 
assessment. If they coincide, it is probable that all the drift assessments were correct. A small 
cocked hat means that the probable error is small. With a larger cocked hat, probably one or 
more of the drifts is in error to some extent.
However, assuming no cocked hat or only a small one (in which case you take the centre), you 
have established the W/V by taking the intersection of the drift lines. The 3 lines intersect 
at the wind point. Rotate it round to the 6 o’clock position to measure the wind speed and 
direction. In this example it is 115/21.

Two-drift Winds
The 3-drift wind would only be necessary for particular applications (for example, bush flying 
and maritime flying, as previously discussed). However, it would be possible to use 2-drift winds 
when flying on airways in the UK in an aircraft which is not equipped with more than airways 
minimum navaids (i.e. no RNAV, GPS, INS or FMS). In this case, the 2 headings need to be at 
nearly right angles to each other, and certainly in excess of 70°. Consider the situation below:
Figure 9.5 An airways route from Brecon to Ottringham via Wallasey
(M)
(M)
The planned track from Brecon to Wallasey is 008°(M) along airway A25, then from Wallasey to 
Ottringham on a track of 085°(M) along airway B1. The pilot homes into Wallasey by applying 
his planned drift to the VOR track. If his drift is wrong, the VOR radial will change. He gets back 
onto the correct centre line, then modifies his drift depending on how the radial changed. 
After a short period of trial and error he will establish the correct drift to hold the radial.
He then arrives at Wallasey and turns onto the planned heading to hold the outbound track 
along B1. Again, if the planned drift was not correct, there will another short series of trials and 
corrections until he finds the heading that holds the VOR radial consistently. He now has drifts 
for 2 headings and can use the Navigation Computer to find the wind point from the cross-cut 
of the drifts on the appropriate headings. The only problem with a 2-drift wind is that there is 
no confirmatory third cut to give some confidence in the other two, but it should be possible 
to assess the drift reasonably accurately when flying along a VOR centre line.

Wind Components
The resolution of wind into head or tailwind and crosswind components is of importance 
both in en route flying (particularly as part of the Flight Planning syllabus) and in take-off 
and landing. There are various techniques of rapidly calculating crosswind components using 
mental arithmetic and rule of thumb methods, but these are not precise enough for General 
Navigation ATPL exam questions, which have to be resolved by use of the Navigation Computer 
in order to ensure the required level of accuracy.
The wind rarely blows directly along the line of an en route track or along the centre line of a 
runway. There is almost always an angle between the track or the runway direction and the 
direction from which the wind is blowing.
Figure 9.6 Wind direction and runway relationship
If the wind direction and the runway direction were the same, the full force of the wind would 
be directed along the runway and there would be no effect across it.
However, in the above example where the wind is blowing at an ‘angle-off’ of 30° from the 
right, only part of the force is directed along the runway. The other part is directed across the 
runway from right to left. The wind velocity of 300°(M)/30 knots is resolved into 2 components, 
one acting along the runway, called the headwind component, and the other acting across the 
runway, called the crosswind component.
It would be possible to solve this by taking the sine and cosine of the wind angle of 30°. The 
headwind component will be 30 knots × cos 30°, i.e. 26 knots, whilst the crosswind component 
will be 30 knots × sin 30°, i.e. 15 knots. However, it is simpler to do it using the Navigation 
Computer.

The Navigation Computer - Multi-drift Winds and Wind Components
Requirement for Wind Component Calculations
Pilots need to be able to calculate both headwind and crosswind components. Taking headwind 
first:
Threshold speed is CAS (or IAS, for all practical purposes). This corresponds to a TAS. However, 
stopping on a runway depends on the value of ½mv2. The ‘v’ is ground speed. A headwind 
will reduce the ground speed on touchdown, requiring less brake energy to stop in a given 
runway length. For a heavy aircraft on a short runway, there may be a minimum headwind 
requirement, below which it will not be possible to stop with an adequate safety margin.
Crosswind can be even more critical. This is because:
With a crosswind, the pilot needs to line up on the approach using the extended centre line 
of the runway as a reference, then point the nose into wind to lay off for the drift on finals. 
At the moment that the undercarriage is about to touch down, it is necessary to apply rudder 
to re-align the aircraft with the runway. This is usually called “kicking off the drift”, although 
it should be a controlled application of rudder, not a “kick”, and applying the correct amount 
requires a certain amount of skill and judgement. The greater the crosswind, the more difficult 
this problem becomes.
Even if the pilot judges this perfectly and the aircraft is precisely lined up with the runway at the 
moment the tyres make contact, there will still be a sideways velocity. Tyres are mainly stressed 
to take fore-and-aft loads, not sideways ones, and it is possible to burst tyres on crosswind 
landings.
Finally, once the pilot has got the aircraft down, he may have trouble holding it on the runway, 
especially if the aircraft has a high tail fin. As the speed slows down, the rudder has less control 
authority and may not be able to counteract the crosswind component acting on the rest of 
the fin. The aircraft may run off the runway.
For these reasons, there will be a maximum crosswind component specified for the type of 
aircraft. Companies may also apply their own rules, quite apart from the aircraft limitation. For 
instance, an aircraft may be cleared to land in up to 25 knots crosswind, but a company might 
have rules that the first officer may only land with a crosswind of up to 15 knots. Above that, 
it has to be the captain’s landing.
Wind Directions – True or Magnetic?
Any FORECAST wind is given in true direction. Thus any written meteorological information 
(TAF, METAR, etc) will be in true. Forecast winds are used for planning navigation as well as 
landing and navigation tracks are normally initially measured in true.
Any information used to help the pilot line the aircraft up on the runway will be given in 
magnetic, because runway directions are always magnetic. Thus a wind from an ATC controller 
will be magnetic and the ATIS always quotes magnetic wind direction.

Now rotate the wind disc to put the runway QDM of 270 at the 12 o’clock index.

Now read vertically ‘down’ the y-axis. This gives you the headwind component. In this example 
it is 23 knots headwind.
Read across from the centre line (the x-axis). This gives you the crosswind component. In this 
example it is 19 knots crosswind (from right to left).
Figure 9.10  Reading off headwind and crosswind
Maximum Wind Strength for a Given Crosswind Component
Sometimes the wind is blowing from a known given direction but it is gusting. A gust is defined 
as an increase in wind speed lasting less than one minute.  Gusts will only be forecast or reported 
if 10 kt or more above the mean wind speed. You may wish to try to land between gusts. In this 
case you continue the approach down to the point at which you must commit to a landing or 
go around. For a visual approach this will be far lower than an instrument decision height. It 
may be 50 feet or lower, depending on the handling of your aircraft. At the last moment you 
request a spot readout of wind from the tower. If the wind strength from the actual direction 
gives a crosswind component of your crosswind limit or less, you can land. Otherwise, you must 
go around.
The moment of visual committal decision is no time to start calculating crosswind limits. You 
should have thought about it beforehand. Before you start the approach, you calculate what 
wind strength from the forecast direction corresponds to your crosswind limit on the runway 
in use. The calculations are made at the top of descent to allow an instant decision at the visual 
committal point.
Take the following case:
TAF W/V	
	
180/10G50
Variation	
	
15W
R/W	
	
	
23
Crosswind limit	
25 knots
This type of calculation requires a different technique. In this case, you do not have a single 
value of wind, so you cannot put it on your Navigation Computer.

Instead you put the runway and the crosswind on your computer, as follows: 
Put the R/W QDM (230) up at the top.
Then draw in 25 knot cross limit parallel lines 
either side of the centre line.
Now rotate the wind disc to the direction that 
the wind is coming from. 
Do not forget to apply variation, if necessary.
In this example, the wind comes from a TAF, 
which is true direction. So the magnetic 
direction will be 195°(M).
Now note where the applicable crosswind 
limit line crosses the centre line.
In this case, it is at 41 knots.
What this is telling you is that when the wind from 195°(M) reaches 41 knots, it will give you 
25 knots crosswind on R/W 23. Provided that the wind is less than 41 knots from 195°(M), you 
may land.

Headwind and Crosswind Limits
On occasions you can be limited by both crosswind AND headwind. You might have to land a 
heavy aircraft on to a single-runway airport and that runway might be short. In this case, you 
may be on your Landing Distance Available (LDA) performance limits and may need, say, at 
least 10 knots down the runway to land. At the same time, there is a crosswind.
Take this example:-
R/W	
	
	
35
ATC W/V	
	
030/10G40
Min Headwind		
10 knots
Crosswind Limit	
20 knots
As before, draw in the 20 knot crosswind parallel markers. But this time, in addition, draw in a 
10 knot headwind limit line.

Now rotate to the direction that the wind will be coming from – in this case, 030°(M):
Figure 9.14  Rotate and read off centre line intersections
Note where the lines intersect the centre line – at 11 knots and 31 knots.
What this is telling you is that, when landing on R/W 35, if the wind from 030°(M) is less than 
11 knots, you have less than 10 knots headwind down the runway. You cannot land. If the 
wind is any greater than 31 knots from 030°(M), you have more than 20 knots of crosswind 
component. You cannot land.
If the wind is between 11 and 31 knots from 030°(M), you have 10 knots or more of headwind 
component AND you have 25 knots or less of crosswind component. You can land.
Tailwind Components
In general, you should avoid landing with a tailwind. If you are given a runway with a tailwind 
component, ask ATC if you can use the other end. It is usually poor airmanship to accept a 
tailwind and you will not have a leg to stand on afterwards if you run off the end – even if your 
brakes fail!
However, you may occasionally have questions that involve tailwind components, so you should 
know how to deal with them.

The Navigation Computer - Multi-drift Winds and Wind Components
The first thing to notice is that you cannot directly plot the horizontal line representing a 
tailwind component in the normal way because it is above the horizontal scale line. You are in 
the curved part of the wind slide.
Let us take a worked example.
R/W	
	
09
Var 	
	
10E
ATIS W/V	
320/10G30
Your maximum tailwind component for this 
particular landing is 10 knots. What is the 
maximum wind speed from the given direction 
that you can accept?
ATIS is magnetic direction, so the value of 
variation is unnecessary information. Ignore 
it. (Watch out for this trap).
Bring the R/W direction (09) round to the top.
Now move the speed slide to bring 10 knots 
under the centre dot.
Draw in the tailwind component limit line. 
THEN DO NOT FORGET TO MOVE THE SPEED SLIDE BACK TO PUT ZERO UNDER THE CENTRE 
DOT!

Now rotate round to the wind direction.
Read off the value of the intersection.
In this example, it is 16 knots.
If you find all that too complicated, do not forget that you can always treat it as a headwind 
problem on the reciprocal runway!
Try treating it as the same type of problem as shown on pages 176 and 177, with the same wind 
of 320/10G30 but landing on R/W 27. You get the same answer – 16 knots.
Allowable Wind Angle for a Given Wind Speed
Another problem sometimes arises which is quickly solved on the computer. It takes the form 
of determining between what directions a wind of given speed can blow without exceeding a 
stated crosswind component.
For example, it is required to find the directions between which a wind of 50 kt may blow 
without creating a crosswind component of more than 30 kt on a runway of direction 250°(M).
1.	
With the runway direction set against the true index, mark a cross on the centre vertical 
line to represent the wind speed of 50 kt.
2.	
Turn the plastic disc clockwise until the cross indicates a crosswind of 30 kt. Note the 
direction which now appears against the true index (214°(M)).
3.	
Now turn the plastic disc anticlockwise and repeat the procedure, reading off the 
direction which appears against the true index (286°(M)).
4.	
The same crosswind component will be present if the wind direction is between 034°(M) 
- 106°(M) - the reciprocals of the directions found in 2) and 3) above, but a tailwind 
component will be present on this runway.

The 1 in 60 Rule
When you are flying, one or both hands will be on the control yoke. The other may have to be 
on the throttle some of the time. Either way, this does not leave you many spare hands to use 
to measure an angle on your map with a protractor.
Over the years, therefore, pilots have had to find other ways to calculate angles quickly and 
easily. One of these is called the “1 in 60 rule”.
Imagine that you have a line on a piece of paper exactly 60 mm long:
Figure 10.1
Now raise a perpendicular at one end, exactly 10 mm high, and join them with a hypotenuse:
Z
60
10
Figure 10.2
This will create an angle, z, in the above diagram. If the adjacent is 60 cm long and the opposite 
is 10 cm long, then the angle z will be 10°.
Similarly, if the adjacent is 60 cm long and the opposite is 5 cm high,  z will be 5°. If the opposite 
is 8 cm high, z will be 8°, and so on - up to a maximum of about 20 degrees, when the theory 
starts to break down.
Measuring Angles in Flight
Suppose you are flying along a planned track of 100°(T) and you have flown 60 miles since your 
last fix, which was on track. You now pass over a clearly recognizable ground feature and you 
note from your map that it is 4 miles right of track. Using the 1 in 60 rule, you can establish 
that your actual track flown (i.e. the Track Made Good, or TMG) was 4 degrees right of your 
planned track and you have actually flown a TMG of 104°(T). You are now in a position to 
calculate some sort of correction – and you have not had to use a protractor to establish the 
angle. We will discuss how you make the appropriate correction in the next chapter.

The 1 in 60 Rule
The Geometry of the 1 in 60 Rule
To use the 1 in 60 rule as a practical pilot, you do not really need to know why it works - as 
long as you just accept that it does. However, for those who are interested, the explanation is 
as follows:
Imagine a circle of 1 metre radius.
What is the formula to calculate the 
circumference?
Circumference = 2 π r
Taking π as 3.142, which is close enough for 
our purposes, then the
circumference = 2 × 3.142 × 1 = 6.284 metres.
Now imagine that we go one metre round the circumference – not the short cut across the 
chord, but along the circumference, like this:
One metre at the circumference will subtend 
an angle θ at the centre. We need to calculate 
the value of θ. Those of you who have done 
some engineering or applied maths will know 
that θ has a value of 1 radian. However, for 
those who have not, we can calculate its value 
from first principles.
Starting at any point on the circumference 
and going all the way round once gives an 
angle of 360° and a distance of 6.284 metres. 
Going just one metre along the circumference 
gives an angle θ. These are in proportion, so 
we can write the following equation:
360  
6.284 
θ 
1
 =
Therefore θ = 57.3°
1 m

191
The 1 in 60 Rule
10
The 1 in 60 Rule
It is a fundamental principle of geometry that provided we keep the ratios the same, we can 
scale a geometrical diagram up or down and the angles will not change. For instance, if we take 
a circle of 2 metres radius then, as long as we also take a 2 metre length of the circumference, 
θ will still be 57.3°. Similarly, θ will remain at 57.3° if we take a circle of 10 metres radius, as long 
as we also take 10 metres of circumference.
Therefore, if we take a circle with a radius of 57.3 metres and consider a length of the 
circumference of 57.3 metres, we now have a situation where 57.3 degrees corresponds to 57.3 
metres – a perfect one to one ratio. However, this only occurs with a radius of 57.3 metres.
Strictly, then, this should be the “1 in 57.3 rule”. But 57.3 is a difficult number to use in mental 
arithmetic when flying, so we approximate it to 60, which introduces only about 5% error, 
which is perfectly acceptable for our purposes.
Another Explanation
Another way of looking at it is as follows:
Figure 10.5
opp
z
adj
Let us write a series of values for z between 1 and 20 in the above diagram and then compare 
the angles with their tangents and see if we can see any relationship.
z
1
2
5
10
15
20
tan z
.017
.035
.087
.176
.268
.364
Nothing leaps out of the page at us. If there is a relationship, it is not a clearly obvious one. 
Looking at the diagram above, what this tangent relationship is saying is, if the adjacent side 
is 1 metre, then the length of the opposite side is the number of metres in the “tan z” row, i.e. 
0.017 metres for 1°, 0.035 metres for 2°, and so on.
Let us now expand the adjacent side to 60 metres in length. This will mean multiplying the 
opposites by 60 as well.
Adding a third row to the above table:-
z
1
2
5
10
15
20
tan z
.017
.035
.087
.176
.268
.364
60 tan z
1.02
2.1
5.22
10.56
16.08
21.84
Suddenly, there seems to be a very close correlation between the angle z and 60 tan z. Now 
a one degree track difference gives 1.02 NM off track in 60 NM along track. A ten degree 
track difference gives 10.56 NM off track in 60 NM along track. Even at 15 and 20 degrees, the 
relationship is pretty close. But you should not really need to use the 1 in 60 rule for angles 
much above 10 degrees - you should never get that far off track.
--- Page 198 ---
The 1 in 60 Rule
10
192
10
10
The 1 in 60 Rule
There are 2 reasons why the above rule does not give a perfect one-to-one correlation as the 
angles get bigger, whilst the first explanation, using the circle, gave an exact relationship - 57.3 
degrees gave exactly 57.3 metres. The first reason is that we intentionally introduced a 5% 
error to make the arithmetic easier - we use a 1 in 60 rule in the air, not a 1 in 57.3 rule. Knock 
5% off all the above figures in the “60 tan z” row, and the correlation becomes very close. 
The second reason is that the perfect correlation comes from using the arc of a circle. The 
above explanation considers a right-angled triangle. The tangent of an angle is not a linear 
relationship, but up to about 20 degrees it is very close.
However, as previously stated, you do not need to know why the 1 in 60 rule works as long as 
you accept that it does and you can apply it in the air.
Expanding or Contracting the Triangle
Figure 10.6
8
60
In the above diagram, the adjacent side represents 60 nautical miles distance gone along track. 
The pilot fixes himself 8 miles left of track. He therefore has a track angle error of 8° left.
However, fixes do not always come conveniently at 60 mile intervals. In any event, 60 NM at 
Warrior speeds corresponds to 30 - 40 minutes, depending on the ground speed, which is too 
long an interval between fixes. We therefore need to be able to use the 1 in 60 rule when the 
along track distance is a figure other than 60.
The problem is a simple one - a matter of similar triangles. Suppose we have only gone 30 miles 
along-track. For the same track angle error, 8° left, we will only be 4 miles left of track.
4
8
30
30
60
Figure 10.7
We simply take the ratio of 60 NM to our along-track distance and multiply our cross-track 
distance by this ratio. This sounds complicated, but is not when you try a few practical examples. 
Four miles in 30 is obviously the same as 8 in 60, so the angle is 8°. Ten miles in 120 is obviously 
the same as 5 in 60, so the angle is 5°, and so on.

The 1 in 60 Rule
If the numbers really do not lend themselves to simple mental proportioning, there is a formula:-
distance off 
distance gone
z =                                × 60 
For instance:- You find yourself 6 miles right of track after 40 miles along track.
In the above formula:

z =             ×  60 
   = 9°

Navigation Using the 1 in 60 Rule
Returning to Track
If you find that you have strayed from track, it may be for a variety of reasons. You could have 
failed to fly the flight plan heading accurately enough, or possibly made too shallow a turn 
from the last track when over the initial turning point. However, for en route navigation, it is 
assumed that the most likely reason is that the wind has changed. 
It is also assumed that, for small changes, a change of track of, say, 10 degrees, is achieved by a 
change of heading of exactly 10 degrees. In fact, as you should recall from the chapter on the 
Navigation Computer and the Triangle of Velocities, sometime as you alter heading, the drift 
changes. However, these rapid navigation techniques assume you will alter your track by the 
same amount that you alter heading.
There are a few points to remind ourselves about tracking errors.
Figure 11.1  Planned track and TMG
planned track
track made good 
The track you intended to fly is called the “planned track”. The track you actually make over 
the ground (presumably because the actual wind is different from the forecast) is called the 
“track made good” (or TMG). The difference between them is called “Track Error Angle”.
Track Error Angle is NOT drift. This is a common mistake amongst beginners to this subject. 
Drift is the angle between Heading and Track (either planned track or TMG). Adding to Figure 
11.1 to draw in the heading should make this clear.
Suppose that, with the forecast wind on the day, you needed to fly a true heading of 100°(T) 
to give you a planned track of 090°(T). This gives the following diagram:-
Figure 11.2  Heading, expected drift, actual drift, and track error angle
planned track 
heading

090°
100°
The difference between the planned track and the TMG (shown as green in Figure 11.2) is 
the track error angle. The difference between the heading and the planned track (shown in 
red) is the expected drift. The difference between the heading and the TMG is the actual drift 
experienced (shown in blue).
It is true that Track Error Angle is the difference between the expected drift and the actual 
drift, but Track Error Angle is not drift itself. This point is important.

There are 3 basic techniques for getting back to track:
•	 Double Track Angle Error
•	 Track Error Angle and Closing Angle
•	 Combined Track Error Angle and Closing Angle Single Calculation.
The last one is simply a variation on the second one, and is a quicker method of achieving the 
same answer.
From these 3 basic techniques, we come up with the Oxford preferred technique, which is 
called New Track Reference.
Double Track Angle Error Method
Consider the following situation. You are planning to fly a particular track (say 090°(T)) and you 
have done your flight plan and calculated a heading to fly. You fly that heading (accurately, we 
assume) but after 30 miles along track you get a pinpoint (a visual fix) which puts you 4 miles 
left of track.
Figure 11.3  4 NM left of track after 30 NM along track

Firstly, calculate the Track Error Angle. Four NM off in 30 NM along is 8°.
If we do nothing about it, we will continue to diverge from track at the same rate. The following 
situation will develop:-
Figure 11.4  Continuing to diverge from track
4
30
The first thing to do is to stop this trend. We are diverging by 8° to the left, so turn 8° right.

Navigation Using the 1 in 60 Rule
Just turning 8° right has not solved the navigation problem, though. It has merely prevented 
it from getting any worse. We are now paralleling track, 4 NM to the left of it, but not getting 
back to it.
It is not good enough to just turn a little bit more - say, another 10° right - and then map-read 
our way back to track. Firstly, there might not be anything significant to see to tell us when 
we are back on track and, secondly, we do not want a navigation technique that requires 
continuous attention from the pilot – i.e. continuous map-reading, in this case. As a single-
pilot, you have many other things to do - fly the aeroplane, monitor changing weather, think 
about fuel, make radio calls as appropriate, carry out engine and electrics checks periodically 
and, most importantly, look out to avoid other aircraft. We want some method that allows 
us to minimize the amount of time spent actually navigating. We therefore want to make 
a measured and controlled turn in a way that will indicate to us when we are back on track 
without having to map-read. 
What we do, therefore, is turn another 8° right, making a total change of 16° right. Now 
consider Figure 11.6 below:
Figure 11.6  Isosceles triangle
4
30
By turning through exactly double the track error angle, i.e. 16° right, we are creating an 
isosceles triangle. It is symmetrical about the cross-track error line (marked ‘4’ in the above 
diagram), i.e. we are converging back to track at a closing angle of 8°. This means that it takes 
the same distance to get back on track as it took to get off track. Therefore the times will 
be the same (there may be a tiny difference because the ground speeds are not absolutely 
identical, but it will only be a matter of seconds - certainly less than a minute).
So, if I start off on track at 1000 hours and find myself off track at 1020, and if I turn by double 
the Track Angle Error, I will be back on track at 1040. No continuous map-reading is required; 
all I have to do is look at my watch.

30
However, the story does not end here. If we do nothing about it once we re-cross our planned 
track, having turned 16° right at our pinpoint, we will now diverge to the right of track, like 
this:-

Figure 11.8  Diverging to right of track

30
So now we turn back 8° left, once we get back to track. And, unless the wind changes again, 
we should now stay on track.
Figure 11.9  Maintaining track by turning back again
4
30
Notice that we have now finished up on a heading 8° right of our initial heading. We turned 
16° right, then 8° left, making a total of 8° right. However, notice that our initial heading took 
us 8° to the left of track - this is why we had the initial track error. Having turned a total of 8° 
right, once back on track, we are now on the heading which, if we had followed initially, would 
never have taken us off track in the first place. So we continue with this for the rest of the leg 
(or until the wind changes again).
Track Error Angle and Closing Angle
Sometimes we may wish, once have found ourselves off track, to head directly for the 
destination (or next turning point), rather than merely regain track. Also, if we are more than 
half-way along track at the first pinpoint, the double track error angle method will not get us 
back on track before the next turning point. In these cases we use a combination of the Track 
Error Angle and the Closing Angle.
Consider the following situation. Your total track distance is 78 NM. As before, after 30 NM 
along track, you get a pinpoint 4 NM left of track. As before, your track error angle is 8° to the 
left.

As before, turning 8° to the right will only parallel track. We now need to calculate the closing 
angle in order to proceed to the turning point.
--- Page 209 ---

Navigation Using the 1 in 60 Rule
This is not too difficult. If we have gone 30 NM along a 78 NM track, there must still be a 
further 48 NM remaining. We are 4 NM off track in 48 to go, so that is 1 in 12 - which is 5 in 60. 
Therefore our closing angle is 5°.
So, we turn 8° right to parallel track and a further 5° right to converge, making a total turn 
of 13° required.
Therefore, to summarize, the required amount of turn is the sum of Track Error Angle and 
Closing Angle.
Combined Track Error Angle and Closing Angle Single Calculation
There is an arithmetical method of solving the above calculation which gives exactly the same 
answer, but does not require you to calculate Track Error Angle. Only the Closing Angle needs 
to be established and it is then multiplied by a factor dependent upon the proportion of your 
distance along track to the total leg distance. This can be quicker.
Consider exactly the same problem. We have a track 78 miles long and after 30 miles along 
track, we are 4 miles left of track. This time, do not bother to work out the Track Error Angle. 
Just consider the Closing Angle.

As before, if you are 30 NM along a 78 NM leg, you must have 48 NM to go. (In practice, you 
will not even have to work this out, because we normally mark our maps up with distance-to-
go, not distance gone). As before, 4 NM off track in 48 to go is 1 in 12 - which is 5 in 60 - so our 
closing angle is 5°.
Take the proportion of your distance along track to the total leg length and invert it. In this 
case,

becomes
Now multiply the closing angle by the inverted fraction and, hey presto, you have the required 
angle to turn in one calculation.

5°    ×
=  13°
This is not an approximation. You can show by a geometrical proof that this method gives 
precisely the same answer as separately calculating the Track Error Angle and Closing Angle. In 
this example, we deliberately chose numbers that were not exactly half or a third or a quarter 
to show that the arithmetic works even for numbers like 13. In practice, most of the time, all 
you will do is estimate that you are approximately, say, one-third of the way along your leg, so 
you need to alter by 3 times your Closing Angle.

Using These Methods Practically
The material which follows is not examined as part of the EASA ATPL exam. However, it may be 
used as part of your flying training.
In practice, you do not have to carry out 1-in-60 calculations in order to work out your Track 
Error Angle and Closing Angle. Instead, what you should do is, in the preflight preparation 
stage, mark up the track on your map with 5 degree and 10 degree guide lines, as shown in 
Figure 11.12.
Figure 11.12  5° and 10° guidelines
10
5
10

10
10
5

Now, with the guidelines, you can rapidly assess the Track Error Angle and Closing Angle of any 
visual fix you get on that leg. You now just have to add the Track Error Angle to the Closing 
Angle to know the total angle to turn to head for the destination turning point.
Practically speaking, this results in too cluttered a chart. The recommended teaching is to draw 
just one guideline at each end of track, at 10°, as in Figure 11.13 below:
Figure 11.13  One 10° guideline each end of track
Similarly, you do not have to use a ruler in the air in order to assess your distances along and 
across track. Mark up your map with distance-to-go using 10 NM markers. Do not use distance 
gone - that is of no interest to you. What you need to know is how many miles remain, without 
having to carry out subtraction in your head. Mark up the map as follows:
Figure 11.14  Distance-to-go markers
10
20
30
40
Figure 11.14 shows a track of length 44 NM and any time you get a visual fix you can instantly 
see how far you have to go. You also have a useful 10 NM scale to help you assess distances off 
track, if you need to.
The recommended technique is a combination of these 2 methods. Mark up the Closing Angle 
guidelines and the distance-to-go markers. Then, if you get a fix a quarter of the way along 
track, alter heading by 4 times the Closing Angle. If you get a fix a third of the way along track, 
alter heading by 3 times the Closing Angle. If you get a fix half-way along track, alter heading 
by 2 times the Closing Angle, and so on.

New Track Reference
New Track Reference is the preferred method. Start off as in the previous paragraph. 
Firstly, It is necessary to hold a steady heading until the aircraft’s position is definitely pinpointed 
– rather than making rash panicky alterations.
Once the aircraft’s position is established, calculate the required heading alteration as follows:
1.	 Estimate, as a fraction, the proportion of the total leg distance covered.
2.	 Invert this fraction.
3.	 Multiply the inverted fraction by the closing angle.
Figure 11.15  Initial heading correction
C (pinpoint)
A
¼
½
¾
Closing Angle = 5º 
B
In Figure 11.15, you pinpoint yourself at C, to the left of your desired track from A to B. The 
closing angle is 5° and you are about ¼ of the way down your track. So:
1.	
Proportion of leg travelled = ¼
2.	
Invert this fraction, giving 4/1
3.	
Multiply this by the closing angle of 5°.
This gives 20°. You alter heading 20° (starboard, of course) for destination B.
We hope that this alteration will allow the aircraft to follow a new track from C to B.
Now, let us assume that the wind has changed subsequently, and we later fix our position at 
D, to the port of our ‘new’ track from C to B.

Angle = 2º 
We apply the system again, this time with respect to our ‘new’ track C-B. Suppose the 10° 
lines show that angle DBC, which is the closing angle with respect to our ‘new’ desired track 
C-B is 2°. Suppose that our new pinpoint D is about halfway between C and B. Then our new 
alteration (to starboard) will be: 2/1 × 2° = 4°.
The only point to bear in mind is that the closing angle must be calculated from the ‘new’ track, 
which will not be drawn on your chart. If you use your 10° guidelines, you must bear in mind 
that they were drawn with respect to the original track, and mentally allow for the first closing 
angle. Similarly, you must estimate the proportion you have travelled of the ‘new’ distance CB, 
not the old distance AB.

The other main applications which may be examined are:
•	 Calculation of height on a glide slope.
•	 Calculation of rate of descent to maintain a glide slope.
•	 Calculation of change of speed on a glide slope.
•	 Calculation of distance off required track using radio aids such as VOR/DME.
Height on a Glide Slope
To find a Rule of Thumb for calculating height on a glide slope, we can use the track error 
technique but view the situation in side elevation rather than plan. For convenience, the glide 
slope angle is referred to as Z°. You need only to understand how to apply the formula, not 
how it is derived.
Figure 12.1  
NM
In Figure 12.1, suppose the range is 1 nautical mile. This is 6080 feet, but an acceptable 
approximation for the 1 in 60 rule is to call it 6000 feet. This introduces only about 1% error.
If Z = 1°
When range = 60 feet, the height is 1 foot. 
When range = 600 feet, the height is 10 feet. 
When range = 6000 feet, the height is 100 feet.
If Z = 2°
When range = 60 feet, the height is 2 feet. 
When range = 600 feet, the height is 20 feet. 
When range = 6000 feet, the height is 200 feet.
This gives the rule:
To make good a glide slope of Z°, your rate of descent should be (100 × Z) ft per nautical mile:

Rate of Descent (ROD)
The rate of descent (ROD) required to maintain a glide slope at a given speed can be estimated 
using the 1:60 rule.
The simple problem is to calculate the height of the aircraft when it is one minute from 
touchdown. After all, the aircraft has to lose this height in one minute. The range at one minute 
is given by ground speed divided by 60.

Other Applications of the 1 in 60 Rule
So, if your ground speed is 60 knots, your range is one mile. On a 3° glide slope, this means that 
your height is 300 feet. So your rate of descent needs to be 300 feet per minute.
If your ground speed is 120 knots, your range is two miles. On a 3° glide slope, this means that 
your height is 600 feet. So your rate of descent needs to be 600 feet per minute.
ROD (in feet per minute) = 5 × Ground speed (in knots)    -    for a 3° glide slope only
If the glide slope is some angle other than 3°, the easiest way is to solve for a 3° glide slope and 
then factor the answer by actual glide slope ÷ 3°.
For example:
What rate of descent do you require to maintain a 4° glide slope at a ground speed of 100 
knots?
For a 3° glide slope it would be 5 × 100  -  500 feet per minute.
For a 4° glide slope, it would be 500 × 4/3, which is 667 feet per minute - 670 for practical 
purposes.
Change of Speed on a Glide Slope
Students may need also to calculate the effect on ROD of changing speed. Firstly, apply the 
following rules:
To maintain a glide slope:
Decrease ground speed, decrease ROD
Increase ground speed, increase ROD
To calculate the amount of the change:
Change in ROD  =  5  ×  change in speed        (3° glide slopes only)
Note: the previous caveats regarding glide slopes other than 3° still apply
Example 1
You are on an ILS approach to London Heathrow using a 3° glide slope. If your ground speed 
is 140 kt, what Rate of Descent (ROD) is required to maintain the glide slope?
For this problem, involving a 3° glide slope, you may use the 5 × ground speed estimate.
ROD = 5 × 140 = 700 ft/min.
Example 2
You are approaching London City Airport on a glide slope of 5.5° at a ground speed of 120 kt. 
What rate of descent is required to maintain the glide slope?
ROD = 5 × 120 × 5.5/3 =   1100 feet per minute

Example 3
Approaching London Heathrow (3° glide slope), an aircraft decreases speed from 140 kt to 120 
kt. What change in the ROD must be made to maintain the glide slope?
Decrease speed = Decrease ROD
Again, for a 3° glide slope only, the 5 × rule can be used.
Change in ROD 	
= 	
5 × change in ground speed        (3° glide slopes only)
	
	
	
= 	
5 × 20
	
	
	
= 	
100 ft/min
Decrease ROD by 100 ft/min (this links with Example 1 and would result in a new ROD of 600 
ft/min).
Example 4
Approaching London City airport (glide slope 5.5°), you reduce ground speed from 120 kt to 
110 kt. What change should you make to your ROD to maintain the glide slope?
Decrease speed = Decrease ROD
For a 3° glide slope.
Change in ROD = 5 × ground speed change = 5 × 10 = 50 fpm
For a 5.5° glide slope.
Change in ROD = 50 × 5.5/3 = 92 ft/min
VOR/DME Problems
A typical examination example:
You are flying along an airway to VOR/DME ‘Q’; the airway QDM is 271°(M). Your Radio 
Magnetic Indicator indicates your QDM to Q as 266°(M), range 48 NM. How far are you off the 
airway centre line and to which side?

Note: you are off track but still within the airway because most airways are 10 NM wide, i.e. 5 
NM either side of centre line.
Finding Range from Change of VOR Bearing
It is possible to use the 1 in 60 rule to work out range from a VOR using the change in VOR 
bearing.
Suppose an aircraft is tracking 090°(M) at 180 knots G/S and at 1100 hrs the QDM to the VOR is 
002° (or the QDR from it is 182°). Five minutes later the QDM to the VOR has changed to 357° 
(or the QDR from it is 177°). What is the range R from the VOR to the aircraft (at the closest 
point of approach)?
Figure 12.4   Range from flying abeam a VOR 
The closest point of approach occurs as the aircraft is perpendicular to track (i.e. at a relative 
bearing of 270°, or when the QDM is 000°). You can treat this as 2 separate right-angled 
triangles of 2° and 3° at the top, but it is easier to do both sums at once and treat it as a near-
right-angled triangle with a 5° angle at the top.

The aircraft has a G/S of 180 knots. Five minutes flight gives a ground distance of 15 NM 
between the first bearing and the second. Therefore an angle of 5° subtends a distance of 15 
NM along track.
For each 60 NM of range R, the angle will subtend 5 NM of range. The range must therefore 
be equal to 3 times 60  =  180 NM.
Alternatively, use the formula:

Introduction
Modern aircraft navigation systems tend to be very reliable and accurate. However, they do fail 
occasionally or suffer degraded accuracy. Moreover, many light aircraft are not equipped with 
sophisticated navigation systems. There is, therefore, a need for pilots to develop and maintain 
visual navigation skills using the basic aids of map/compass/stopwatch/eye and brain. It is 
essential that pilots can interpret the conventional symbols (the legend) of all the aeronautical 
charts they use. A set of legend decodes is included at the end of this chapter.
Aeronautical charts show 3 basic characteristics:
•	 Relief (Terrain) 
•	 Other Features 
•	 Scale
Relief (Terrain)
If an aircraft is to be navigated safely in poor weather, great care must be taken to avoid high 
ground, either by flying round it or over it at a safe altitude. However, terrain features can 
make excellent visual references in good weather.
Pilots should therefore understand how these features are depicted.
Information concerning the location and height of high ground is given on maps in various 
ways.
Contours. Lines drawn joining all places which are at the same elevation above mean sea level 
are called contours and the intervals at which they are drawn can be read from the chart. 
Always check whether the contours are depicted in feet or metres. Contours which are close 
together indicate steeply sloping ground whereas widely spaced contours indicate gently 
sloping ground.
Layer Tinting (Colour Gradient). A different colour is used for ground in different elevation 
bands. For example, land between mean sea level and 250 feet may be coloured white, 
between 250 feet and 500 feet light yellow, and so on. A key to colour code is given in the 
margin of the map.
It is important to realize that both contours and layer tinting (which is effectively contours 
with the spaces between them coloured in) are based on elevation, i.e. vertical distance above 
mean sea level.
Spot Elevations. The elevations of prominent peaks are shown in figures. For easy recognition 
the highest spot height is printed on a white rectangle which has a black perimeter, and 
its position is given in the margin. Others are simply a dot, for the exact position, with the 
elevation printed alongside.
Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF) or Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). Most Government-
produced topographical charts (for instance, the CAA charts and the US Government TPC 
and ONC series) show Maximum Elevation Figures (MEF). Many commercially-produced charts 
(such as Jeppesen’s) show Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) - which may also be known as Grid 
Minimum Off-Route Altitude (Grid MORA).

Topographical Maps and Map Reading
It is important that you check which is shown on the chart you are using. The difference may, 
quite literally, be a matter of life and death.
Whether MEF or MSA, the basic calculation of the dominant obstacle is the same. The chart 
is divided up into convenient-sized rectangles of latitude and longitude for the scale of the 
chart. On the CAA and TPC 1:500 000 charts the rectangles are half a degree of latitude and 
longitude, on the ONC every whole degree, on some of the Jeppesen small-scale charts every 
5 degrees, and so on. Within the rectangle, the highest natural feature (mountain, hill, ridge) 
is noted. The highest man-made obstruction (TV transmitter mast, crane, tall building, etc) is 
also noted. Every structure of a height AGL of 300 feet (UK and US) or 100 metres (328 feet 
- continental Europe) or more is required by law in the appropriate country to be notified to 
the national aviation authority (CAA, FAA, etc). Therefore there may be unknown structures 
of less than 300 feet (or 100 metres). In order to take account of these possible unknowns, the 
following rules are applied:
•	 For a made-made obstruction, the elevation is accurately known, so no further allowance 
is necessary.
•	 For a natural feature, someone may have built an obstruction of up to 300 feet (100 metres) 
on top of a hill quite legally without informing the CAA. Therefore a safety factor of 300 
feet (100 metres) is added to the elevation of natural features.
The higher of the two is taken and then rounded up to the next whole hundred feet, i.e. 968 
feet becomes 1000 feet.
Consider an example. Within a particular rectangle there is a TV mast of elevation 1432’ and a 
hill of 1268’. Add 300’ to the hill; it becomes 1568’. Round this up to 1600’.
For a chart displaying Maximum Elevation Features (MEF), the figures 16 would appear in the 
rectangle. 
If the chart shows Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) - also known as ‘Safety Altitude’, a further 
safety factor is added. If the rounded-up figure is 5000 feet or more, 2000 feet is added.
If it is less than 5000 feet, then 1000 feet is added. In the example shown above, the MSA 
would become 26.
Note that CAA charts, TPCs and ONCs all show MEFs, not Safety Altitudes. THE MEF IS NOT A 
SAFETY ALTITUDE.

•	 Railways

An exercise to consolidate knowledge of chart symbols is given at the end of this Chapter.
In addition to understanding chart symbols, the pilot will need to measure distances on the 
chart. In many cases, the use of an appropriate navigation ruler will suffice but the pilot should 
be sure in this case that the chart being used is constant scale. In any event, the pilot should 
know the various ways that chart scale is depicted.

Scale
Scale is the relationship between the length of a line drawn between two positions on a chart 
and the distance on the Earth between the same points.
Three methods of expressing scale are common:
Statement in words. This is self-explanatory. The statement “One inch to ten nautical miles” 
means that a line one inch long on the chart represents a line ten nautical miles long on the 
Earth. 
Representative Fraction. This is a statement in words put into mathematical form and is 
calculated from the equation:
Chart Length 
Earth Distance
Scale	
 =	
 
By convention, the chart length is always 1 and the dimensions above and below the line are 
the same and thus cancel each other to make the fraction dimensionless , i.e. representative. 
Thus on the ICAO 1:500 000 topo, 1 cm on the chart represents 500 000 cm on the Earth and 1 
inch on the chart represents 500 000 inches on the Earth.
 “One inch to ten nautical miles” becomes a representative fraction of 1:729 600
1 
729 600
or
Graduated Scale Line. Graduated scale lines are normally depicted at the bottom of the chart 
as in Figure 13.1 and may be in nautical miles, statute miles or kilometres. Since one degree 
of latitude is equal to 60 nautical miles, the provision of a latitude scale in effect provides a 
graduated scale line as is shown in Figure 13.2.

Map Reading
Map reading can be defined as visualizing the physical features of the ground as represented 
on the map by symbols and forming a mental picture of the ground by relating the features 
one to another. This is known as reading map-to-ground. This is the basic technique used when 
confident that you are near track and near on-time. There is a reverse process used when 
less certain of position called reading ground-to-map which involves seeing an arrangement 
of features on the ground and being able to find those features on the map and thus locate 
oneself.
Visual navigation using map reading is a skill which needs practice and which will develop with 
experience. A number of factors can make the task easier and the most important of these 
factors are thorough flight planning and preflight route study. It is also important in flight to 
try to remain on track and time and, if off track, to regain track as soon as possible. But do not 
concentrate too much on navigation alone. It is equally important to keep a good look-out 
to reduce collision risks, to be aware of any potential weather problems, and to manage the 
aircraft systems.
Visual Checkpoints
In the planning stage, the pilot will study the route and select visual checkpoints normally 
occurring at about 5 to 10 minute intervals. A visual checkpoint will be a significant ground 
feature which can be overflown or used as a reference to fly an appropriate distance away 
from. Ideally, the checkpoint should be recognizable from some distance away to allow for 
timely alterations of heading. Visual checkpoints do not need to be exactly on track; a good 
feature close to track is better than a poor feature on track.
Selecting Visual Checkpoints
The ideal visual checkpoint will be recognizable from some distance away and have the 
following features:
Large.  A large feature will be recognizable from some distance but may be too large to use 
for precise navigation. A good principle is to use part of a large feature as the checkpoint, e.g. 
if using Birmingham as a checkpoint, you will see Birmingham from some distance but choose 
a large motorway junction as your accurate checkpoint.
Unique.  Be sure that the checkpoint chosen could not be mistaken for a similar checkpoint in 
the same area. For example, disused airfields make good checkpoints but in East Anglia there 
are so many disused airfields (from WW2 USAF operations) that it is easy to make mistakes.
Vertical Extent.  Features which have significant vertical extent, e.g. masts, mountains, should 
always be identified for safety reasons, but they do make good visual checkpoints particularly 
because they can be identified, in good visibility, at some distance. Thus, if you can see a radio 
mast 20 miles away and you know you need to fly 1 mile to the right of the mast and you are 
flying at 120 kt, you have solved the navigation problem for the next 10 minutes and can spend 
your time checking aircraft systems, keeping a good lookout and enjoying your flight. But the 
value of features with good vertical extent alone may diminish if you fly higher – at 5000 ft 
AGL, you may not easily see a 400 ft high mast.

Contrast.  A visual checkpoint should contrast in colour or texture with its surroundings. Contrast 
changes with the seasons and with geographic location ,i.e. the contrast between features may 
be entirely different in winter and summer or in polar or desert regions. Remember also that 
you may have to map-read at night when the rules of contrast are significantly different. Then, 
unless there is a good level of moonlight, the checkpoints must be lit. Finally, serious flight 
safety risks occur in meteorological/geographic conditions of poor visual contrast leading to 
the possibility of visual illusions. 
It is rare for a visual checkpoint to have all the attributes mentioned above and your selection 
of checkpoints for a flight will probably be a compromise. Much will depend on the altitude 
you intend to fly, the seasonal/meteorological conditions and the nature of the terrain over 
which you will be navigating. In the next section, the relative merits of various types of visual 
checkpoint are discussed but the section cannot provide a comprehensive guide – you, the 
pilot, must weigh your own selections against the ideal criteria.
Some Typical Visual Checkpoints.
Coastlines.  Coastlines generally provide excellent daytime visual checkpoints and, given 
reasonable moonlight, can also be used at night. Coastlines are rarely uniform for any great 
distance and precise navigation can normally be achieved by reference to estuaries, headlands, 
ports or lighthouses.
Water Features.  Lakes, large rivers and canals normally show up well even taking into account 
seasonal variations such as floods and droughts.
Water features tend to occur in the lowest ground in a particular area and, when flying at low 
level, small water features may be hidden from view by surrounding high ground. Small rivers 
are often tree-lined which can help by providing contrast but can hinder the identification of 
a particular feature of the river.
Mountains/Hills.  Mountains and hills can make excellent visual navigation features but flight 
in hilly/mountainous terrain must only be undertaken after due consideration has been given 
to safety aspects. In general, terrain features with good vertical extent are more useful for 
navigation at low altitudes (and also more dangerous). Isolated hills provide the best features 
whereas terrain which undulates fairly uniformly is difficult to use unless additional features are 
available. Valleys tend to be good visual navigation features as they can normally be identified 
from their orientation and the presence of other cultural features, e.g. roads, railways and 
towns, offer the opportunity of many precise checkpoints.
Towns/Villages.  Never overfly built-up areas below 1000 ft AGL or below a height from which 
you could glide clear of the built-up area in the event of an engine failure. That said, towns 
and villages are useful as general indicators of position and may be used to locate more precise 
visual checkpoints. Towns are useful features at night because they are normally well-lit but the 
same is not true of villages.
Roads. 	Motorways (and major roads) can provide excellent check features by day and night. 
Even if there is no discernible checkpoint available on the feature, the feature itself is a line 
feature and can be used for a track check or a timing/ground speed check. Generally, precise 
checkpoints can be found at regular intervals along these features, e.g. crossroads, motorway 
junctions and service stations.

Minor roads make less reliable check features but can still be significant in areas of open country 
and barren mountainous terrain. A good general guideline is, the bigger the road, the better 
for navigation.
Railways. When flying near large towns or industrial areas it can be difficult to identify 
particular railway lines but in more open areas, railway lines are excellent visual line features 
and can provide precise checkpoints at junctions, stations or where there are conspicuous 
bridges. Railway lines are not normally visible at night.
Woods.  The usefulness of woods as visual check features is variable. In general, the rule 
remains ‘the bigger, the better’. Large woods often have distinctive shapes if flying above 
1000 ft AGL, but their shapes are often difficult to recognize from lower levels particularly 
in hilly terrain. Also, woods change shape due to felling and planting programmes and this 
particularly applies to coniferous plantations (fir forests). Finally, woods are susceptible to 
seasonal contrast changes. Snow-covered trees do not contrast with snow-covered fields (but 
on the other hand, snow melts first on the trees and when this happens, shape and contrast 
are enhanced). Use woods with care.
Other Features.   Many other features can provide excellent precise visual checkpoints: power 
stations or isolated factories can often be seen at great range and often emit steam or smoke 
which aids identification and also facilitates estimation of surface wind velocity. If you make 
use of this, remember that the wind veers and increases with height above the surface. Also 
remember that power stations are often located along rivers and there may be several power 
stations along a particular stretch of river. Airfields stand out well by day from heights above 
1000 ft AGL but always be aware whether the airfield is active or not. Airfield identification 
beacons are readily visible at night.
Quarries stand out particularly well but check NOTAMS for blasting activity.
Monuments, follies and chalk cuttings are precise features but rarely lit.
Lighthouses are excellent features by day or night but they are not unique unless identified in 
relation to coastal features by day or by their correct light transmission characteristics by night.
Some Visual Navigation Hazards
Some meteorological or geographic circumstances when a flight is being flown or navigated 
visually can lead to increased flight safety risks through the possible occurrence of visual 
illusions. These circumstances are dealt with in more detail in the Human Performance syllabus 
but are summarized here below:
In less developed areas such as deserts, jungles, tundra or snow fields usable features may be 
widely separated or even non-existent.  Another problem could be that topographical maps of 
these areas may be incomplete.
In areas of snow and ice from horizon to horizon and where the sky consists of a uniform layer 
of clouds so that no shadows are cast, the horizon disappears causing Earth and sky to blend. 
In this situation and in ‘white-outs’ caused by blowing snow, distance and height above ground 
are virtually impossible to assess visually.
In conditions of poor contrast and particularly over snow covered ground, it is possible to focus 
on high ground well ahead of the aircraft and to fly the aircraft to cross that ground with the 
appropriate clearance. The poor contrast may mask intervening high ground over which your
--- Page 233 ---

227
Topographical Maps and Map Reading
13
Topographical Maps and Map Reading
clearance may be considerably less than planned. This situation is known as ‘the hill in front of 
the hill’ and is particularly dangerous when flying at lower altitudes.
Flying over a smooth water surface, snow or a smooth desert surface makes it extremely 
difficult to judge height. The difficulty can be exacerbated in the overland situation if there 
are no features with vertical extent, e.g. trees. In a desert or tundra landscape, it is easy to see 
bushes and scrub trees and imagine they are full-size trees when they may actually be only a 
few metres high.
At night when flying over dark areas of sea or land where there are scattered pinpoints of light 
(ships, oil rigs, small settlements or isolated buildings) it is possible to become disorientated 
and to confuse the scattered lights below with the scattered stars above. This situation may be 
exacerbated after or during aircraft manoeuvres.
Navigation Techniques
Pilot navigation techniques and chart preparation requirements appropriate to visual 
navigation (including the 1:60 rule) are discussed in relevant flight exercise briefings.
A disciplined approach is always the most successful. When setting heading from a start point 
or when altering heading at a turning point, always check that you are flying the correct 
heading and that the compass is synchronized. Always check that you have the appropriate 
altimeter setting and are flying at a safe altitude. Always check that you have started/restarted 
your stopwatch, or you know how much you are running early/late on planned time.
Even the best navigators become occasionally uncertain of position. It is very tempting in this 
situation to carry on regardless. DON’T! Start immediately to try to resolve any uncertainties 
using all aids available. This is a critical phase of your flight and it is very common for pilots in 
this situation to over-concentrate on navigation and to forget to check fuel/aircraft systems. 
Check your fuel/aircraft systems and then follow a ‘lost’ procedure. If you are still uncertain 
when you are due at a turning point, turn on time (ETA), and obey the rules below.
Lost Procedure
•	 Check compass/ASI to ensure you are flying planned headings/speeds.
•	 If meteorological/airspace restrictions do not apply, climb to increase your visual/radio 
horizon.
•	 Fix your position using all aids available (VOR/DME, VDF, radar fix, or visual fix).
•	 If restricted to visual (map reading) methods, calculate a DR position. (DR = ‘Deduced 
Reckoning’, commonly known as ‘Dead Reckoning’)
•	 The DR position should be deduced using the position/time of the last known accurate fix 
and the track/ground speed/time flown since that fix.
•	 Then, draw a ‘circle of uncertainty’ around the DR position. (The circle is normally drawn 
with a radius of 10% of the distance flown since the last fix). Remember that the DR position 
continues to move along track and the ‘circle of uncertainty’ gets larger with time). Now 
map-read from ground-to-map. Try to identify a large visual feature and locate the aircraft 
on the map with reference to this feature. On most occasions the aircraft position should 
lie within the circle of uncertainty.

•	 If still in difficulty, consider turning towards a good visual line feature outside the circle of 
uncertainty, e.g. coastline, motorway, main railway. On reaching this line feature, turn and 
follow it until you find a definite visual checkpoint from which proper navigation can be 
resumed.
Be careful that you do not fly towards high ground in poor weather below safety altitude or 
that you do not fly into controlled airspace without clearance. Always keep a good lookout, 
monitor your fuel and aircraft systems and remember that you can use the Emergency Fixing 
Service on 121.5 MHz (PAN call ).

Convergency and Conversion Angle
Introduction
Meridians are great semi-circles joining the poles. From this it follows that meridians converge 
as they run towards the nearer pole, and diverge as they run away from the nearer pole.
Figure 14.1 demonstrates this. Starting at the North Pole, it can be seen that the two meridians 
‘x’ and ‘y’ diverge until they cross the Equator, where they are parallel to each other. As they 
continue into the Southern Hemisphere they begin to converge, finally meeting at the South 
Pole.
Figure 14.1    Diverging, parallel and converging 
meridians
It is reasonably easy to see that two meridians, say, 60 degrees of longitude apart, must be 
parallel to each other at the Equator.

At the Pole, however, they will converge at an angle exactly equal to their difference in longitude 
- in this case, 60°. There are 360° of longitude - 180°E and 180°W, and a full revolution looking 
down vertically on the pole is also 360°. Therefore the angle at the pole is the difference in 
longitude.
Figure 14.3    Maximum convergence at Pole
It also follows that at some intermediate latitude, there will be an intermediate amount of 
convergence. The angle of inclination of the 2 meridians will be more than zero (the value at 
the Equator), but less than 60° (the value at the Pole).

Convergency
This angle is known as Convergency or as Earth Convergence. Convergency is defined as the 
angle of inclination between two selected meridians measured at a given latitude.
Figure 14.5    Converging and diverging meridians
Figure 14.5 shows our 3-dimensional problem as a 2-D drawing. However, you should have 
been able to see from the 3-D drawings of the spherical Earth why the angle at the Poles is the 
change in longitude.
In Figure 14.5 above:

At the Equator, where the latitude is 0°, (convergency/ch.long) is zero. At the Poles, where the 
latitude is 90°, (convergency/ch.long) is a factor of one
Therefore the relationship between convergency and latitude is a function of the sine of the 
latitude.
This gives us the formula:
Convergency  =  Change in Longitude  ×  Sine Latitude

Figure 14.6    Convergency
In Figure 14.6 the latitude chosen is 30°N, and tangents have been drawn to each meridian at 
this latitude. The angle between the slope of the two tangents is convergency.
In this example, the change of longitude is 40°.     (sin 30°	
 =  0.5)
Therefore:
convergency	
=	
40°  ×  0.5
	
	
=	
20°
We now have a formula for calculating convergency between any 2 meridians at the same 
latitude. However, it may not be immediately obvious why a pilot should wish to know what 
the convergency between 2 meridians at any particular latitude is.
Convergency and the Great Circle Track
At any point on the Earth, True North is defined with reference to the direction of the local 
meridian. If you are at a different meridian in flight from the point at which you started, your 
local direction of True North has changed. This is the reason why a rhumb line is a continuously 
curved line on the Earth’s surface. If it did not constantly curve, it could not cut all the meridians 
(which are at different angles to each other) at the same angle.
If you are flying a great circle track (all automatic computing systems, such as Inertial Navigation 
Systems, Global Positioning Systems, and Flight Management Computers do, in fact, compute 
steering signals along great circle tracks), then your great circle track will alter over a period of 
time with the respect to True North by exactly the amount of convergency. The track direction 
is defined by reference to the meridians, and if the direction of the meridians changes, then 
the track direction changes.
The change in great circle track direction is the angle of inclination of the meridians at the 2 
points where the track is measured.

Convergency and Conversion Angle
Figure 14.7 shows a great circle cutting two meridians, X and Y. Tangents to the meridians have 
been drawn at the points where the great circle cuts them, and convergency is shown in the 
same way as before.
The great circle direction at meridian X is represented by the angle ‘a’ and the great circle 
direction at meridian Y by the angle ‘b’. The difference between the two is ‘b’-’a’   =  convergency.
Figure 14.7    Convergency as the change in great circle direction
In this case, however, the meridians are not crossed by the great circle at the same latitude. 
Indeed, there are only 2 mean track directions (due East or due West) where they will be at the 
same latitude. On any other mean track, by definition, there will be some element of north or 
south latitude change between the meridians.
In this case, we cannot use the simple convergency formula because there is no one term for 
‘sine latitude’. The calculation requires the sine of the mean latitude between the two points. 
However, determining the mean latitude is a complex process as it will be closer to the nearer 
pole than the mid-latitude (with 2 exceptions).  Hence, although the formula requires mean 
latitude, for simplicity we use mid-latitude.  The difference between the sine of mid-latitude 
and the sine of mean latitude is so small that it is virtually insignificant unless large change of 
longitude is involved (which is unlikely). To summarize, convergency is the angle of inclination 
between two selected meridians measured at a given latitude and is equal to the difference 
between the great circle directions measured at each meridian. Its value may be calculated 
from the formula:-
Convergency = Change in Longitude × Sine Mean Latitude

Practical Examples
Let us examine how this works in practice (and also learn how to answer typical exam questions) 
by looking at a worked example.
Question 1
The initial great circle track from A (4000N 00200W) to B (5000N 01000E) is 060°(T). What is 
the initial great circle track from B to A?
Start by drawing a diagram. It is only a sketch, to get the situation into your mind - not a scale 
drawing. You are in the Northern hemisphere. So draw a couple of meridians converging 
northwards, like this:
Figure 14.8    Meridians converging northwards
The initial great circle track from one of them is 060°(T). So make it the left-hand one, because 
if you draw it from the right hand one, the bearing goes off the diagram, like this:
Figure 14.9    Incorrect diagram - so choose the other 
one instead

Figure 14.10    Meridians converging northwards
This means that the left-hand intersection must be A and the right-hand one must be B. (The 
question says “The initial great circle track from A is 060(T).”)
Check it out by reference to the latitude and longitude.
If we have it right:
Figure 14.11    Checking the diagram for sense
With an initial track of 060°(T) at A, B should be north of A (it is: B is at 50N, A is at 40N) and 
B should be east of A (it is: B is at 010E, A is at 002W).
Now that we have the diagram right, we can calculate the convergency:
Convergency = Change in Longitude × Sine Mean Latitude
The change in longitude is 12° (from 002W to 010E).
The mean latitude is 45N (halfway between 40N and 50N). Sine 45° is .7071.

Questions
Now, there are 2 ways to solve this problem, depending on which definition of convergency 
you prefer.
If you use the definition that:
convergency = change in great circle track between 2 meridians, then the great circle track has 
changed 8.5 degrees between A and B.
It left A on a track of 060°, so using the rules given by the D-I-I-D diagram in chapter 2:
Travelling eastwards in the Northern hemisphere, the track will increase. The track angle will 
be 068.5° as it passes through B. To find the track from B to A, as it passes through B, take the 
reciprocal, 248.5°
If you prefer the definition that: 
convergency = angle of inclination between 2 meridians, then start like this:

Questions
Parallel the meridian at A over to B:
Angle M is 8.5° (the inclination of the meridians). Angle N is 060° (corresponding angles 
between meridians in classical geometry).
Therefore the total of M + N is 068.5°.
Figure 14.13    Parallel the meridian
The meridian at B defines True North at that point. So the track angle of the continuation of 
the line AB is 068.5° at B.
Therefore the great circle bearing of A from B, measured at B, is 248.5°
Now try the following:
Question 2

Answer to Question 2
a.	
As the track has changed from 300°(T) to 295°(T), the convergence must be 5°.
The question tells us that C is at 36°N and D is at 42°N, so the mean latitude must be 39°N.
Now, substituting in to the equation:
convergency = ch.long × sin mid lat
5° = ch.long × sin 39°
5° 
sin 39
Change in longitude   =               =   8°
Figure 14.14  The basic diagram
If the change in longitude is 8° and C is at longitude 015°E and D is west of C, then the 
longitude of D is 00700E.
b.	
Longitude 01100E is halfway between 01500E and 00700E. Therefore the great circle
track will be halfway between 300°(T) and 295°(T), i.e. 297.5°(T)

Answer to Question 3
Southern hemisphere this time. Draw in an initial great circle track of 250°(T). It must be from 
the right-hand side of the diagram if it is going to cut the other one.  Therefore the right-hand 
one must be H and the left-hand one must be G.
Figure 14.16    Meridians converging southwards
Just to be 100% certain we have it right, check the latitudes and longitudes. The question tells 
us that H is 40S, G is 45S. So G should be south of H on our diagram; it is. H is 170W and G is 
174E. As we are crossing the Greenwich anti-meridian (180E/W), left and right are the right 
way round on this diagram - confusing, but correct. Check the explanation in chapter 1 if 
clarification is required.
convergency	 =    ch.long × sin mid lat
	
	
=   16°  ch.long  ×  sin 42.5°   =   10.8°
Therefore, as before - either say that the convergency is the change in great circle track angle, 
so the track angle at G is 260.8°(T) going westwards, therefore the reciprocal at G is 080.8°(T).
Or, say that convergency is the angle of inclination of the meridians. Draw in a parallel 
construction line, as follows:
The reciprocal track from the parallel construction line from G to H is 070°. The convergency 
between the parallel construction line and the meridian at G is 10.8°. Therefore the track 
angle from True North (i.e. the meridian) at G back to H is 080.8°.

Conversion Angle
Consider the following situation:
(In this example, the drawing has been done as a Mercator-type projection, with the meridians 
shown as parallel lines, even though they are in fact convergent on the Earth. This is to make it 
clear that the Rhumb Line track does not change track angle but the great circle does. 
Figure 14.18    Rhumb line and great circle
In Figure 14.18, we have 2 meridians 40 degrees of longitude apart. Now consider both the 
great circle and the Rhumb Lines running from A (30N 020W) to B (30N 020E).
The Rhumb Line (shown in red) is the parallel of latitude of 30N and therefore has a constant 
track direction of 090°(T) at any point along it.
However, the great circle changes direction. The diagram shows that it leaves A on a track 
angle of less than 090°(T) and crosses B on a track angle of more than 090°(T).
We can calculate the amount that it changes direction, as follows:-
convergency 	=    ch.long × sine mid lat
	
	
=    40° change of longitude × sine 30°
	
	
=    20°
So, whatever direction it left A on, its track angle will be 20° greater at B. Now, the diagram 
is completely symmetrical about the mid-latitude (0°E/W, in this example). We know that the 
Rhumb Line track angle is 090°(T)all the way, which is also the direction of the great circle track 
at mid-longitude. Therefore the great circle track must have left on a track of 080°(T) at A and 
passed through B on a track of 100°(T).
The difference between great circle direction and Rhumb Line direction joining two given 
points is called conversion angle
Conversion angle, in our example, is 10°. At A, it is the difference between 080°(T) (the great 
circle track) and 090°(T) (the Rhumb Line track). At B, it is the difference between 100°(T) (the 
great circle track) and 090°(T) (the Rhumb Line track). Conversion angle is always the same at 
each end of the 2 points connected by the great circle and the Rhumb Line tracks.

This leads to the following definition and formulae:
Figure 14.19    Conversion angle
Conversion angle is the difference between great circle direction and Rhumb Line direction 
joining two given points.
Conversion angle is ½ convergency.
Conversion angle = ½ change of longitude × sin mean latitude
Figure 14.20    Same situation - different projection
It is equally possible to draw the diagram with convergent meridians. In this case, the great 
circle appears as a straight line, even though its track angle changes direction, and the Rhumb 
Line appears as a curve, even though it is a line of constant True direction. However, the great 
circle still runs nearer the near pole, exactly as on the globe.

Figure 14.21    INS waypoint changeover
The Rhumb Line track all the way from WP 1 to WP 3 is 090°(T). However, the INS will steer 
the aircraft along the great circle track from WP 1 To WP 2, then change over at WP 2 to a 
continuous great circle track steer from WP 2 to WP 3. Therefore the great circle track will start 
off at less than 090°(T) and end up on more than 090°(T) on each of the 2 legs. At WP 2 there 
will be a left turn at the waypoint changeover. Each individual leg follows the D-I-I-D rules, i.e. 
the track angle increases, going easterly in the Northern hemisphere, but at the changeover, 
the result is a left turn.
Taking either leg, the change of longitude is 10 degrees and the mean latitude is 53N.

Therefore the great circle track leaves WP 1 on 086°(T) and approaches WP 2 on 094°(T). At 
the waypoint changeover, the INS reverts to a track steer of 086°(T) at the start of the second 
leg, which increases to 094°(T) on approaching WP 3. There is therefore an 8° decrease of 
track angle on passing WP 2.

Departure
Definition of Departure
Departure is the distance between two meridians along a specified parallel of latitude, 
usually in nautical miles.
Consider Figure 15.2 below. You can see that 
our 2 meridians represent the same change of 
longitude, whatever their latitude. However, 
because they converge from the Equator to 
the Pole, the same change of longitude does 
not represent the same East- West distance in 
nautical miles.
If we take the Equator as our specified parallel 
of latitude, the distance between 2 meridians 
will be greater than at some higher latitude.

Departure
Departure is maximum at the Equator where 
1° change of longitude (ch.long) equals 60’ of 
arc of a Great Circle.
Departure is zero at both poles because the meridians converge and meet at these two points.
Figure 15.4    Zero at Poles
Departure therefore varies as the cosine of the latitude.
It can be found by applying the formula:
Departure (NM) = ch.long (in minutes) × cos lat
Since this distance is always along a parallel of latitude it represents a Rhumb Line distance.

Calculation of Departure
Consider 2 meridians on the Earth, joined by 
a parallel of latitude, as in Figure 15.5. The 
diagram is reduced to a sketch in Figure 15.6, 
below:
In this example, the change of longitude is 20 
degrees.
Multiply by 60 to convert it into minutes.
Then multiply by the cosine of 52°.
Departure (NM) = ch.long (min) × cos lat
 = 	
20 × 60 × cos 52°
 =	
738.8 nautical miles

Types of Departure Questions
There are 2 main types of question on departure:
•	 Variations on the basic departure formula
•	 Given departure at one latitude, calculate it at another
These are set out in more detail below:-
Variations on the Basic Departure Formula
Example 1	
An aircraft at position 6000N 00522W flies 165 km due East. What is the new 
position?
Firstly, convert 165 km to NM. 165/1.852 = 89 NM.
Now substitute into the departure formula:
	
Departure (NM)    =    ch.long (min)  ×  cos lat
	
	
           89     =    ch.long  ×  cos 60°	
Therefore, 	
 ch.long    =    89 / .5   =    178 min of longitude
This is 2°58’ East from an initial longitude of 00522W.
The new position is 6000N 00224W.
Example 2	
In which latitude is a difference of longitude of 44°11’ equivalent to a departure 
of 2000 NM?
44°11’ = 2651 minutes of arc
Departure (NM)   =   ch.long (min) × cos lat
	
       2000   =   2651  ×  cos lat
Dep 
ch.long
cos  lat.   =
	
2000 
2651
 =          	
=     0.7544
∴  Latitude is 41° North or South

Departure
Given Departure at One Latitude, Find It at Another
Example 3
An aircraft leaves position ‘G’ in Latitude 40°S 
and flies the following Rhumb Line tracks and 
distances:
G to H: 180°(T) 240 NM H to J: 270°(T) 240 NM 
J to K: 000°(T) 240 NM
What is the Rhumb Line bearing and distance 
of ‘K’ from ‘G’?
There are 2 ways you can solve these types of question. One is by a double substitution into 
the basic departure formula. It works, but it is a bit slower. The other is by use of the following 
formula:-
Departure at Latitude   A       cos A 
Departure at Latitude   B       cos B
The new formula is quicker and saves time. Let us do the question both ways, firstly using 
double substitution into the basic departure formula and then by use of the new formula. You 
should then see the advantage of the new formula.
Method 1
	
240 NM = change of lat of 4°S           ∴ lat of H = 44°S
	
	
Departure (NM)	
=	
ch.long (min) × cos lat
	
	
	
	
240	
=	
ch.long  ×  cos 44°
	
240 
cos 44°
Therefore ch.long. H to J	
=
	
	
ch.long. H to J		
=	
333.6 minutes of longitude
Change of lat from J to K also 	
=	
4°
Thus K will be at 40°S and change of long from G to K is the same as H to J, i.e. 333.6 min of 
long
	
	
Departure (NM)	
=	
ch.long (min) × cos lat
	
	
	
	
	
=	
333.6 × cos 40°
	
	
	
	
	
=	
255.6 NM
Rhumb Line bearing	
	
=	
270°(T)

Departure
Method 2
Re-arrange this formula:
	
Departure at Latitude A	
	
cos A 
Departure at Latitude B	
	
cos B
into	
Departure at Latitude A   =	 Departure at Latitude B ×
cos A 
cos B
Choose Latitude B to be the one for which you already know the departure (240 NM), which is 
44S, which means that you can solve for Latitude A (40S) without any further rearrangement 
of the algebra.
cos 40° 
cos 44°
Departure at Latitude A 	
 =   240  × 	
	
=	
255.6 NM
Inspection of the Answers
Do not forget that for some questions, it is not always necessary to calculate. If the 4 option 
answers are given, it may be possible to solve the question by elimination of the impossible 
answers and save calculation time.
Example 4
An aircraft at position 2700N 17000W travels 3000 km on a track of 180°(T), then 3000 km on 
a track of 090°(T), then 3000 km on a track of 000°(T), then 3000 km on a track of 270°(T). 
What is its final position?
a.	
2700N 17000W 
b.	
0000N/S 17000W 
c.	
2700N 17318W 
d.	
2700N 14300W
Answer: 
If the aircraft starts at 2700N and it travels the same distance (3000 km) due S, then E, then N, 
then W, the change of longitude when flying westward (at the higher latitude) will be greater 
than when it flew eastward at the lower latitude. Therefore it will finish up at the same latitude 
that it started from, but further west. Answer (c) is the only one that fits. You can do the 
calculation if you like, and you will get the right answer, but it is not necessary.

Scale
Scale is the relationship between the length of a line drawn between two positions on a chart 
and the distance on the Earth between the same points.
Three methods of expressing scale are common:
Statement in words. This is self-explanatory. The statement “One inch to ten nautical miles” 
means that a line one inch long on the chart represents a line ten nautical miles long on the 
Earth. Jeppesen charts often use this method; for instance, the Jeppesen E(HI) 1 / 2 uses a scale 
of 1 inch to 20 NM.
Graduated Scale Line. Graduated scale lines are normally depicted at the bottom of the chart 
as in Figure 16.1 and may be in nautical miles, statute miles or kilometres. Since one degree of 
latitude is equal to 60 nautical miles, a latitude scale on the chart in effect provides a graduated 
scale line as is shown in Figure 16.2.
Figure 16.1     
Figure 16.2     Latitude scale
NM
Representative Fraction. This is a statement in words put into mathematical form and is 
calculated from the equation:
Chart Length 
Earth Distance
Scale	 =
--- Page 282 ---
Scale
16
276
16
16
Scale
By convention, the chart length is always 1 and the dimensions above and below the line are 
the same and thus cancel each other to make the fraction dimensionless - representative. Thus 
on the ICAO 1:500 000 topo,1 cm on the chart represents 500 000 cm on the Earth and 1 inch 
on the chart represents 500 000 inches on the Earth.
Converting from a Statement in Words to a Representative Fraction
When converting from a statement in words to a representative fraction, you must ensure 
that you use the same units for both the numerator and the denominator. For instance, if 
converting ‘One inch to ten nautical miles’ into a representative fraction, substitution into the 
above equation gives:
1 inch 
10 nautical miles
Representative Fraction	
   =
Multiply by 6080 to get the denominator into feet:-
1 inch 
10 × 6080 feet
Representative Fraction	
   =
And then by 12 to get it into inches:-
1 inch 
10 × 6080 × 12 inches
Representative Fraction	
   =
Now both numerator and denominator are in the correct units, i.e.: 
1 
729600
Representative Fraction	
   =
so the RF becomes dimensionless - it will work with centimetres or any other units as long as 
the ratios remain the same.
Reminder about Conversion Factors
You will find the following conversion factors useful in dealing with typical scale problems:
1 nautical mile 	
=	
6080 feet or 1852 metres
1 metre	
	
=	
3.28 feet
1 inch	 	
	
=	
2.54 cm
5.4 NM	
	
=	
10 kilometres
Example 1
On a particular chart, 5 cm represents 7 nautical miles. What is the scale?
Answer:
Chart Length 
Earth Distance
Representative Fraction   =
	
	
	
     
5 cm 
7 (nautical miles) × 1852 × 100
=

(We multiply 7 by 1852 to convert to metres, then by 100 to convert to centimetres)
	
	
	
5 
1 296 400
=
However, we always express Representative Fractions with ‘1’ as the numerator. We need to 
divide both numerator and denominator by 5.
Representative Fraction	
 =
1 
259 280
Easy Calculator Operation
The easiest way to enter all this on to your calculator in one stage is to evaluate the denominator 
first then divide by the numerator, i.e. in the above example, as follows:
7  ×  1852  ×  100  ÷  5   =   259 280
The answer comes out as the denominator. You then have to write it down as 
1 
259 280
If you enter numerator first, you get the RF expressed as a decimal, like this:
5  ÷  (7  ×  1852  × 100)   =   0.000003856
If you then want to use your x-1 key, fine. But it is quicker to do it the first way.
Types of Scale Question
There are 2 basic sub-divisions of scale problems: Simple Scale and Mercator Scale. Mercator 
Scale problems are dealt with in a later chapter. All simple scale problems are dealt with by 
substituting into the one basic equation:
RF	
=
CL 
ED
Sometimes you are given the Chart Length and the Earth Distance and asked to find the RF, 
as in the previous example. Sometimes you are given the scale (the RF) and the ED and asked 
to find the CL. Sometimes you are given the RF and the CL and asked to find the ED. Just 
substitute what you know into the above equation, apply any conversion factors necessary to 
get both CL and ED in the same units, rearrange if necessary to make the unknown the subject 
of the equation, and solve using your calculator.
Example 2
On a chart of scale 1/5 000 000, how many nautical miles on the Earth are represented by 1.7 
cm?
RF	
=
CL 
ED

1.7 cm 
ED

Re-arranging:-

1852 × 100

=   45.89 NM
Rounding Errors
The conversion factors we have quoted are, in many cases, only approximate. There is often 
more than one way to carry out the conversions, and sometimes a scale numerical problem may 
be solved by converting both numerator and denominator into metric units or alternatively, 
both to imperial units. This may give small differences in the answers. Look at the 4 options 
given in the question and choose the nearest.
Large and Small Scale
Confusion often exists as to whether a chart is ‘large scale’ or ‘small scale’.
A UK Ordnance Survey Map is an example of a large scale chart with a scale of 1:50 000.
Two centimetres on this chart represents one kilometre on the Earth. The chart does not cover 
much area, but there is lots of detail. This is a LARGE scale chart.
A world atlas would be an example of a small scale chart - it covers a lot of area, but there is 
not much detail.
LARGE SCALE  -  LOTS OF DETAIL
SMALL SCALE  -  LOTS OF AREA
However, the Representative Fraction is in the right sense. A SMALL scale gives a SMALLER RF. 
A LARGE scale gives a LARGER RF. Consider 2 charts, one a 1/50 000 UK Ordnance Survey and 
the other a 1/5 000 000 small scale chart.
Scale
Representative Fraction
Expressed as a 
Decimal
Large
1/50 000
0.00002
Small
1/5 000 000
0.0000002
You can see that 0.00002 is a LARGER number than 0.0000002. The Representative Fractions 
are in the right sense. The confusion occurs because the denominators are easier to handle 
and so that is how we usually refer to charts. We call the first chart a “fifty thousand” in 
conversation. We call the second one a “five million”. We do not refer to them as a “0.00002” 
or a “0.0000002”. But the logic of ‘large’ or ‘small’ is correct.
So:-
LARGE SCALE  -  SMALLER DENOMINATOR
SMALL SCALE  -  LARGER DENOMINATOR

Chart Projections - General
The transfer of information from a globe on to a flat paper chart is achieved by ‘projection’, 
because, originally, the technique involved using a light source within the globe to project 
the latitude/longitude graticule on to a flat sheet of paper. Today, the projection is achieved 
mostly by using computer models. However, an understanding of the original projection 
techniques using light is more than adequate for understanding the properties of charts, 
whatever actual method of production is used.
 “Perspective” and “Non-perspective” Charts
Charts produced directly from a projection are called perspective or geometric 
projections. Charts produced by mathematical methods are called non-perspective 
charts. Most of the charts we use are in this latter, non-perspective category but they can 
be thought of as perspective projections which have been modified mathematically.
The “Reduced Earth”
The term “Reduced Earth” (RE), means the scale model of the Earth on which the 
projection of the chart is based. To make a 1:1 000 000 chart, a one millionth scale model 
of the Earth will be used.
Types of Projection
There are 3 general types of projection surfaces:
•	 Azimuthal/Plane
•	 Cylindrical
•	 Conical
Azimuthal/Plane Projections
An azimuthal (or ‘plane’) projection is produced by placing a flat sheet of paper against 
a point on the Earth. A common use is to provide charts of the North/South polar regions 
(this is the only example taught and examined in the EASA syllabus). The resulting ‘Polar 
Stereographic’ charts are covered in more detail in a later chapter.
The principle of the projection is illustrated in Figure 17.1

The graticule of the projection would appear as in Figure 17.2.

Note:	 Although this projection has produced a chart of the entire Southern hemisphere, the 
chart would only be used in the central area, in this case for flights over Antarctica.

Cylindrical Projections
The earliest chart projections were produced in the 16th century by a Flemish navigator called 
Gerard de Kremer who used the Latin alias ‘Gerardus Mercator’. His projections used cylinders 
of paper wrapped around the “Reduced Earth” and touching the RE at the Equator. The 
projection technique is illustrated in Figure 17.3.
Figure 17.3     Simple cylindrical projection and graticule
When the graticule has been projected onto the cylinder, the cylinder is opened to produce at 
flat sheet of paper. Cartographers then can add the geographic detail.
Note that the shapes look a little strange. This is explained in chapter 18 (Mercator Charts).
Again, notice that most of the world (except the Poles) has been projected and the user would 
only use a section of the chart (in this case, normally near the Equator).

Conical Projections
Conical projections involve placing a cone of paper over the Reduced Earth and projecting the 
graticule onto the cone. Subsequently the cone is slit along one side and the cone can then be 
opened to produce a flat sheet of paper. The technique is illustrated in Figure 17.4.

Figure 17.5
In Figure 17.4(a), the cone is placed over the Earth. The graticule is projected onto the cone. 
The cone is then slit in Figure 17.4(b) (along the Greenwich meridian in this case). The cone is 
then ‘developed’ (opened) to give the flat sheet of paper and graticule illustrated in Figure 
17.5. In this case, the chart will show the whole Northern hemisphere. The user will need only 
a small section of the chart, for example the rectangle suggested. In this section of the chart, 
the graticule will look more familiar (similar to the ICAO 1:500 000 topographical chart) and 
this is illustrated in Figure 17.6.
Figure 17.6 Typical conical graticule
The conical graticule in Figure 17.6 is typical of the Lambert’s Conical Chart which is discussed 
in Chapter 20.

Properties of an Ideal Chart
Having developed methods of projecting the spherical Earth onto a flat sheet of paper, we 
should now consider what properties we require of the chart. The following is a list of properties 
we might like on an ‘ideal’ (perfect) chart. (The list is not comprehensive).
Representation of the Earth’s Surface
•	 Angles on the Earth’s surface should be represented by the same angles on the chart.
•	 Scale should be constant and ‘correct’.
•	 Areas should be represented with their true shape on the chart.
•	 Equal areas on the Earth’s surface should be shown as equal areas on the chart.
Navigation Requirements
•	 Rhumb Lines should be straight lines. 
•	 Great Circles should be straight lines.
•	 Latitudes/Longitudes should be easy to plot 
•	 Adjacent sheets should fit correctly.
•	 Coverage should be worldwide.
Two of these properties can never be obtained, except on the globe.
Scale can never be constant and correct. We can modify charts mathematically to give 
nearly constant scale in small areas, but not over large areas.
The shapes of large areas cannot be represented perfectly. However, it is possible to 
represent the shapes of small areas reasonably accurately.
All the other ideal properties can be obtained on charts, but unfortunately not together on 
the same chart. However, not all of them are essential for navigation. For instance, it really 
does not matter to a pilot whether areas are correctly represented or not. You do not make 
comparisons of area when flying. Even a reasonable amount of distortion of shape is acceptable, 
provided it is not too great and landmarks can be recognized.
Orthomorphism / Conformality
Of all the ideal properties, the only essential one is that navigation bearings must be “correct” 
and the critical property is that angles on the Earth must be represented correctly on the 
chart.
This property is critical to aviation - or indeed for navigation generally. If you draw a line joining 
2 points on the chart and measure the angle but then find that this does not correspond to 
the true direction on the Earth, the chart is useless for navigation. You might previously have 
thought that if you measure a track off any map, it will correspond to Earth direction but this 
is not true for most charts. Those charts that do have this property are in the minority and are 
known as orthomorphic or conformal charts.
Note: Your ICAO 1:500 000 Topographical chart is called a “Lambert’s Conformal Conic” - just 
above the graduated scale
--- Page 295 ---

General Chart Properties
Remember that people produce charts for many reasons - not just navigation. For example, 
if your field of expertise is farming, then you might be interested in whether 1000 hectares 
of land in Kansas produces a greater or a lesser tonnage of wheat than 1000 hectares of land 
in Azerbaijan. In that case, the property you would look for in a map would be an accurate 
representation of area - but it would not matter to you whether bearings were represented 
accurately.
Therefore, from the vast range of projections available, we have to select only those which are 
orthomorphic (or conformal).
There are two fundamental conditions which must be met to achieve orthomorphism/ 
conformality.
Condition 1 The meridians and parallels on the chart must intersect at right angles (as they 
do on the Earth). This is illustrated in Figure 17.7.
Figure 17.7    Orthomorphism 1
Consider a rectangle on the Earth’s surface as depicted in Figure 17.7a. Also, consider the 
bearing of position X from position 0, which is 056°. In Figure 17.7b, the chart graticule has 
been distorted and the meridian/parallel intersection is not 90°. Not only is the shape incorrect 
but the bearing from 0 to X is now 028° rather than 056°. The chart is not conformal.
Look at the graticules so far discussed. They all meet the 90° intersect rule.
--- Page 296 ---

General Chart Properties
Condition 2 The second condition relates to the scale at a point on the chart and is illustrated.
Figure 17.8     Scale at a point
A square on the Earth has been illustrated in Figure 17.8(a) along with the line 0Y which has 
a bearing of 045°(T). In Figure 17.8(b) representing the chart, the N-S scale has changed but 
the E-W scale has remained the same. The overall effect is that the shape has changed to a 
rectangle and the bearing 0Y is now 035°(T) rather than the correct 045°(T) on the Earth. The 
chart is not orthomorphic/conformal.
On an orthomorphic chart, scale at a point should be the same in all directions.
The above diagram implies that a chart should be constant scale which we know is only true on 
a globe. On a chart, scale will change. The condition 2 is modified to be:
At any point on a chart, scale should be the same in all directions, or should change at the 
same rate in all directions.
Refer back to Figure 17.3. The shapes on the simple cylindrical projection have been distorted, 
in this case stretched in a N-S direction because the N-S scale is changing at a greater rate that 
the E-W scale. Mercator, the Flemish cartographer, recognized this problem and mathematically 
adjusted the N-S scale change to produce the conformal Mercator chart which is the subject of 
the next chapter.

Introduction
The earliest method of transferring the graticule of meridians and parallels from a globe to 
a flat sheet of paper was achieved using cylindrical projections, described in the previous 
chapter. A scale model of the Earth, the Reduced Earth (RE), was made at an appropriate scale. 
A cylinder of paper was wrapped around the RE, touching the RE at the Equator. Using a light 
source at the centre of the RE, the graticule was projected onto the cylinder. The cylinder was 
then ‘developed’ or opened up to a flat sheet of paper.
The technique described above would produce a perspective projection. This simple cylindrical 
projection technique is illustrated below.
Figure 18.1     Simple Cylindrical Projection
The projected graticule had one significant advantage for early navigators - the meridians 
were equally spaced parallel lines. Thus a straight line drawn on the chart would have a 
constant direction - the straight line on the chart would be a rhumb line. With their basic 
compass systems, early navigators preferred to sail constant directions and had to accept the 
fact that they would be sailing a rhumb line. Modern navigators use more advanced guidance 
systems and normally aim to fly the great circle track (more of this later).
Mercator’s Projection - General
In the 16th century, a Flemish cartographer called Gerard de Kremer, who used the Latin 
alias ‘Mercator’, recognised the limitations of the simple cylindrical projection. The projected 
graticule met one of the requirements for an orthomorphic/conformal chart - the meridians 
and parallels crossed at right angles. Therefore, a straight line was a line of constant direction 
- a rhumb line. Unfortunately, it was not the correct direction. The shapes were clearly not 
correct and therefore angles on the chart were not correct.

Mercator Charts - Properties
Note the shapes in Figure 18.1 - they are stretched in a N-S direction. Mercator realized that 
this was caused by failure to meet the second requirement of orthomorphism/conformality, 
namely that - at any point on a chart, scale should be the same in all directions, or should 
change at the same rate in all directions. On the simple cylindrical projection, the N-S scale 
was changing at a different rate from the E-W scale. Mercator determined that the E-W scale 
was changing such that, at any latitude, the scale was proportional to the secant of the latitude 
(secant = 1/cosine). However, the N-S scale was changing such that, at any latitude, the scale 
was proportional to the tangent of the latitude, resulting in the N-S stretching of shapes. This 
can be seen below in Figure 18.2.
Figure 18.2     Simple Cylindrical Projection 
 Latitude spacing is a function of tan (lat)
Mercator solved the problem by adjusting the positions of the parallels of latitude. The 
parallels had been projected as parallel lines with separation between the parallels increasing 
in proportion to the tangent of the latitude. Mercator adjusted the parallels of latitude so that 
their separation increased only at a rate proportional to the secant of latitude, matching the 
E-W scale change.
Briefly, Mercator mathematically adjusted the positions of the parallels of latitude to make 
the chart orthomorphic/conformal.
Because the chart has been mathematically produced, it is a non-perspective chart.
Mercator solved the problem in 1569. Because his solution was so simple, elegant, and correct, 
we still use his projection today, over 400 years later. A modern Mercator chart looks very 
different from his own because we have subsequently discovered and explored so many more 
countries. However, the basic principles of the graticule have not changed. He got it right.
An example of the adjusted Mercator projection is given in Figure 18.3.

Figure 18.3     Mercator Projection
This Mercator projection is often called a normal or direct Mercator. The projection surface 
touches the Reduced Earth at the Equator. The geographic poles cannot be projected (they 
are on the axis of the cylinder). 
Scale
Mercator scale expands as the secant of the latitude.
This arises out of the departure formula. You will remember that:
	
Departure  =  change of longitude (min)  ×  cos latitude
Mercator realized that, by the use of a cylindrical projection, the meridians were produced as 
parallel lines. This meant that a change of longitude on the chart was always represented by 
the same distance on the chart (so many centimetres), whatever the latitude. Therefore, we 
are holding the change of longitude (the Chart Length) constant and we need to see how the 
departure (the Earth Distance) changes with latitude. This tells us how the scale changes with 
latitude. We therefore re-arrange the formula as follows;
	
change of longitude	 =
Departure 
cos latitude
--- Page 302 ---
Mercator Charts - Properties
18
296

18
Mercator Charts - Properties
However, in mathematics there is a trigonometrical function called the secant. Its definition is 
that:
	
secant θ    =
1 
cosine θ
Therefore we can re-write the above equation as:
	
change of longitude	 =	
Departure × secant latitude 
As the E/W scale has to change as a function of the secant of the latitude (because the 
meridians are parallel at all latitudes), then, as Mercator realized, the N/S scale has to change 
by the same amount.
We therefore come up with the following equation:
	
scale at any latitude (λ )   =   scale at Equator  ×  sec (λ ) 
Let us see how this works with a practical example. Take a case where the scale at the Equator 
is 1/1 000 000. Now let us calculate what the scale on a Mercator chart will be at 8°N (or S) 
latitude.
	
scale at 8° N	 =	
scale at Equator   ×   sec 8°N
	
	
	
=	
	
	
×
1 
1 000 000
1 
cos 8°
There is no point in evaluating secant as a numerator. In multiplying out representative 
fractions, we want ‘1’ on the top line. We are better off writing secant as 1/cos, because then 
we shall be multiplying denominators.
So:-
	
scale at 8°N    =	
	
	
×
1 
1 000 000
1 
0.990268
	
	
	
 
=
1 
990 268
This shows that the scale at 8°N (or S) latitude is 99% of the scale at the Equator, or within 1% 
of correct scale.
This 1% figure is of importance in navigation. Up to a scale error of 1%, we can regard a chart 
as being of “constant scale”, which means that you can measure distances using a ruler. Once 
the scale error increases to more than 1%, we must find distances either by calculation or by 
using the local latitude scale and measuring small distances at a time with a pair of dividers.
The most important figures to remember are that Mercator scale is:
	
Within 1% up to 8° from the Equator.
--- Page 303 ---
18
297
Mercator Charts - Properties

Mercator Charts - Properties
In examination questions, 8° is often approximated to 500 nautical miles. If you see this number 
in questions, it is often a clue that the examiner is using it to mean 8°, and is referring to the 
1% scale error band.
To summarize:
•	 Mercator scale is correct (same as the Reduced Earth) at the Equator.
•	 Mercator scale expands as the secant of the latitude.
•	 Mercator scale is within 1% up to 8° from the Equator.
Orthomorphism
All charts used for navigation must be orthomorphic. This chart is orthomorphic/conformal by 
mathematical construction (Mercator’s adjustment of the parallels of latitude). The projection 
is non-perspective.
Graticule
The graticule is rectangular. Meridians are equally spaced parallel lines. Parallels of latitude 
are parallel lines with the space between them increasing as the secant of the latitude.
Shapes
Mercator produced an orthomorphic projection. However, looking again at Figure 18.3, (or 
Figure 18.4) the student should notice that the areas are not correctly represented. Correct 
representation of area is not required on an orthomorphic chart.
Thus, Greenland appears as large as Africa on the chart, despite the fact that the land area 
of Africa is approximately 18 times that of Greenland. In reality, the land area of Greenland is 
only the same as the small NE corner of Africa, as illustrated in Figure 18.4. Similarly, the land 
area of Scandinavia illustrated is only one third of the land area of India, but on the chart they 
appear to have similar areas. Note also the chart length equivalent to 3000 NM at 60N, which 
is twice the chart length for the same distance at the Equator.
This distortion of area and change of scale also leads to change of shape. Land masses at high 
latitudes appear too wide for their height compared with the same land masses on a globe or 
on a chart with convergent meridians. Compare the shape of the North American continent, 
for instance, on a Mercator with its shape on a globe (Figure 18.5b and Figure 18.5a). The 
continent appears too wide. The E/W distance from Labrador to Western Alaska seems too 
great compared with the distance from Northern Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico.

These distortions of shape are insignificant over small distances and therefore have no effect 
on a pilot’s ability to map-read. They have no implications for rhumb line navigation at all, but 
they can give a false impression of the most direct routing, especially at high latitudes. This 
point was covered in Chapter 2.
Chart Convergence
The concept of Earth Convergence, or Convergency, was covered in Chapter 14. It is the angle 
of inclination of the meridians on the Earth, (or the change in direction of a great circle), 
between 2 longitudes. However, for each type of projection, we also have the concept of Chart 
Convergence. This is the angle of inclination between meridians on the chart, (or the change 
in direction of a straight line), between 2 longitudes.
For a Mercator chart, as all meridians are parallel, their mutual inclination is zero. The change 
in direction of a straight line drawn on the map is also zero. It will always cut all meridians at 
the same angle. That is why Mercator produced the projection in the first place - so that a 
straight line on the chart gives a single track angle.
Earth convergency is also zero at the Equator, but nowhere else. Therefore Mercator convergence 
is correct at the Equator (only) but constant everywhere (always zero).
Rhumb Lines
Because the meridians are parallel lines, a straight line track drawn on the chart will cut all 
meridians at the same angle. A straight line track on a Mercator chart is a rhumb line.
Great Circles
The rhumb line between two points will always be nearer to the Equator than the 
corresponding great circle. Conversely, the Great circle between two points will always lie 
nearer the Pole than the rhumb line.
This was covered in detail in Chapter 2. The statement can be simplified visually in Figure 18.6.

Figure 18.6  Mercator Chart - rhumb lines and Great 
circles
Apply these rules to the Mercator chart at Figure 18.7. Consider a round-the-world trip from 
London to Los Angeles, USA to Auckland, New Zealand to Singapore and returning to London. 
The route is drawn on a Mercator chart in Figure 18.7.

All the tracks drawn are rhumb line tracks. From London to LA, the rhumb line track is 
approximately 257°(T). From LA to Auckland, the rhumb line track is approximately 221°(T). 
From Auckland to London, the rhumb line track is approximately 301°(T). Note that the 
Auckland/London rhumb line track passes through Singapore.
Now draw in the great circle tracks for the same route.
Figure 18.8   London/LA/Auckland/Singapore/London - Great circles
Note the shapes of the great circles. The Equator and the meridians (which are great circles) 
project as straight lines. All other great circles project as curved lines concave to the Equator 
(convex to the nearer Pole).
Mathematical Calculations
In the above discussion, the rules about the shapes of great circles have been stated. Given the 
rhumb line direction, the student also should be able to calculate the direction of the great 
circle. The angle between the great circle and the rhumb line is conversion angle (CA) where:
	
Conversion Angle (CA) = ½ Earth Convergency (EC)
	
or
	
Conversion Angle (CA) = ½ × ch.long × sin (mean lat)
Now review Figure 18.8 and consider the route from London to Los Angeles.
--- Page 308 ---
Mercator Charts - Properties
18

18
Mercator Charts - Properties
As stated previously, the rhumb line direction (a straight line on a Mercator chart) is 
approximately 257°(T). The angle between the rhumb line and the great circle is conversion 
angle (CA). In this case:
	
Conversion angle  =  ½  ×  ch.long  ×  sin (mean lat)
Using approximate values
	
CA	
=	
½ × 120 × sin 45°
	
	
=	
60 × .707     =	  approx 42°
Therefore the great circle track from London to LA, measured at London, is approximately 
257° + 42° = 299°(T)
Now calculate (using equivalent values) the great circle track direction from LA to London, 
measured at LA.
Answer: approximately 035°(T)
	
R/L track is 077°(T) - reciprocal of 257°(T).
	
Conversion angle is approx. 42°.
	
Therefore, great circle track is approx. 035°(T).
Similar exercises could be carried out for all the other sectors. However, a problem would occur 
on the sectors crossing the Equator. For example, on the Los Angeles to Auckland sector, it 
could be argued that the conversion angle is zero because the mean latitude is 0° (the Equator). 
In these situations the sector would have to be divided into two - the first sector from LA to the 
Equator (mean lat approx 18°) and the second sector from the Equator to Auckland (mean lat 
approx 18°).
There are 2 exceptions to this rule.
The Equator and meridians are straight lines (because they are also rhumb lines).

the student to recognize that the track between two places on the same parallel of 
latitude must be East/West 090°(T)/270°(T)

Mercator Scale - General Principles
We covered the general principles of Mercator scale in the previous chapter. A cylindrical 
projection must produce the meridians as parallel lines. Therefore, the scale in the E/W sense 
at any latitude is defined by the departure equation. The change of longitude (which is a 
fixed distance on the chart, whatever the latitude) remains constant. By re-arrangement of the 
equation, we find that this means that the E/W scale depends on the secant of the latitude. 
Mercator, therefore, devised a projection in which the N/S spacing of the parallels of latitude is 
also a function of the secant of the latitude. Now that both the N/S and the E/W scale expansion 
were at the same rate, the projection became orthomorphic - though non-perspective.
On a Mercator chart, scale expands away from the Equator. The scale expansion is 
proportional to the secant of the latitude.
We therefore finish up with the following equation:-
	
Scale at any latitude (λ)   =   Scale at Equator   ×   sec (λ)
This is the starting point for all Mercator scale problems. Questions generally come in one of 4 
basic types:
•	 Given scale at the Equator, find Mercator scale at some other latitude.
•	 Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find scale at the Equator.
•	 Given Mercator scale at some latitude, find Mercator scale at some other latitude.
•	 Given a fixed chart distance between meridians, find Mercator scale at a specific
latitude.
Given Scale at the Equator, Find Mercator Scale at Some Other Latitude
Example 1
If the scale of a Mercator chart at the Equator is 1:1 000 000, what is the scale at 60N (or S)?
a.	
1:2 000 000
b.	
1:1 000 000
c.	
1:866 000
d.	
1:500 000
Whenever solving problems using representative fractions (RF) for scale, remember that the 
scale must be written mathematically in fraction form.
	
Scale at 60N   	 =   Scale at Equator  ×  secant 60N
	
	
	
1 
1 000 000
=	
	
×  secant 60°
But it is easier if we write secant as 1/cos. That way, we get 1 as the numerator, which is what 
we want, and we only have to multiply out the denominators.

Answer:1:500 000 (d)
The trap in this question is that at 60°N/S, the scale on a Mercator chart is double the scale 
at the Equator. If the scale doubles, the denominator of scale is halved. Remember, if scale 
expands, the denominator decreases; if scale contracts, the denominator increases.
Given Mercator Scale at Some Latitude, Find Scale at the Equator
Example 2
If the scale of a Mercator chart at 52S is 1:2 000 000, what is the scale at the Equator?
a.	
1:3 250 000 
b.	
1:1 000 000
c.	
1:866 000
d.	
1:500 000
Start in the usual way:-
	
Scale at 52S	
=   Scale at Equator  ×  secant 52S
Now substitute in what you already know:-
	
  
1 
2 000 000
1 
cosine 52°
         =   Scale at Equator   ×
Re-arranging:-
	
cosine 52° 
2 000 000
Scale at Equator   =
Again, as in some of the basic scale calculations, it is easier to enter this into your calculator 
denominator first, then divide by the numerator. This gives you the value of the denominator 
with ‘1’ as the numerator, which is what we want for a representative fraction.
	
Key in:  2 000 000   ÷  cos 52  =
	
You will then get the answer:   3 248 538
	
1 
3 248 538
You write it down as
The answer is therefore (a).

There are 2 learning points to note from this answer. One is that the options on scale questions 
are often approximated to the nearest round number. The correct answer to the scale question 
was 1:3 258 538, but the closest option available is 1:3 250 000. This is not unusual.
The other is that you do not need to do the calculation at all. Scale must expand away from the 
Equator. The denominator must be biggest at the Equator and then reduce as you move away 
from the Equator. Since you knew that the denominator at 52S was 2 000 000, the denominator 
at the Equator must be a bigger number, i.e. the scale must be smaller. In this particular set of 
options, answer (a) is the only one which is smaller. This would have saved you time.
Given Mercator Scale at Some Latitude, Find Mercator Scale at Some 
Other Latitude
There is a short cut formula which gets rid of the need to use secants and the need to remember 
to write the representative fraction as a fraction. You simply need to remember that the large 
figure in the RF is the denominator. (It is also the figure we most commonly remember). Thus 
a 1:500 000 chart (ICAO topo) has a denominator (D) of 500 000.
The following derivations need not be remembered but the final formula is important.
When comparing scales at two different latitudes on a Mercator chart, we can write
At latitude A:
	
Scale at A	
=   Scale at Equator  ×  secant A
At latitude B:
	
Scale at B	
=   Scale at Equator  ×  secant B
Divide the two scale formulae:
	
Scale at A 
Scale at B
secant A 
secant B
Scale at Equator 
Scale at Equator
=
×
This can be simplified to:
	
Scale at A 
Scale at B
secant A 
secant B
=
but even further simplified to:
	
1 
DenominatorA
1 
DenominatorB
1 
cosine A
1 
cosine B
=
The equation to remember is this one:

DenominatorB

You may recall that this is also the formula used to compare the departure between two 
longitudes at different latitudes. The only difference now is that D represents the denominator 
of scale rather than the departure.

Example 3
On a Mercator chart, the scale at 54S is 1:2 000 000. What is the scale at 25N?
a.	
1:2 000 000
b.	
1:3 084 000
c.	
1:1 121 000
d.	
1:3 825 000
Firstly, use your knowledge to discount answers a and c. At 25N, you are closer to the Equator 
than at 54S. Therefore, scale must contract between 54S and 25N - the denominator at 25N 
must be larger than at 54S. In some cases, there may only be one appropriate answer given 
and the answer can be spotted without calculation. In this case, answers b and d could be 
correct and we need to revert to the simplified formula.
	
DenominatorA 
DenominatorB

cos B

Let DA 		
=   scale denominator at 25°N

2 000 000
cos 25° 
cos 54°

cos 25° × 2 000 000

Therefore DA 	 =

Given a Fixed Chart Distance between Meridians, Find Mercator Scale 
at a Specific Latitude
Example 4
On a Mercator chart, the chart length between two meridians, 160E and 160W, is 30 cm at 
30S. What is the scale of the chart at 30S?
There are 2 ways of doing this, and there is very little to choose between them.
The first is to treat it as a departure problem.
	
Chart Length 
Earth Distance
Scale 	 =
Chart Length	 =   30 cm
Earth Distance	=   Departure
       Departure 	=   ch.long (min) × cos lat
	
	
=   (40° × 60) × 0.866 NM
	
	
=   2078 NM

=
 	
Scale is   1:12 831 000
Note: This has little to do with Mercator charts and is essentially a Scale/Departure problem.
Alternatively, you can find the scale at the Equator as a normal RF, then convert to scale at 30S, 
like this:
Chart Length 
Earth Distance
Scale at Equator	
=
The Earth distance at the Equator is 40° of ch.long × 60 NM (the Equator is a great circle). This 
comes to 2400 NM. Now get numerator and denominator in the same units and work out the 
RF.
30 cm

Now we just have a normal scale change problem, just like Example 1.

Example 5	
(This appears to be a more complex problem but is as straightforward as 
Example 4)
At 40N, the scale of Mercator chart is 1:10 000 000. What is the distance in centimetres 
between the 160E and 160W meridians at 20S?
An immediate problem appears to be that the scale is given at 40N but the distance between 
the two meridians has to be calculated at 20S. Initially, the student might be tempted to 
change the scale from 40N to 20S using the scale conversion formula previously given. This 
is unnecessary. Think about the Mercator chart - it has parallel meridians and so the distance 
between two meridians will be the same at all latitudes. The problem can be solved completely 
at 40N.

Area of “Constant” Scale
For practical navigation, charts may be considered to be constant scale in any area where the 
scale is within 1% of correct scale.
On a Mercator chart, scale is constant and “correct” only along the Equator.
The scale is within 1% of “correct” scale within a band of 8° latitude either side of the Equator 
(see Note 1).
Note 1 The 8° figure can be quoted in exams as 480/500 NM.

Introduction
All the questions are of the same standard as the Gen Nav ATPL exam - it is just that, for this 
test, they are drawn only from those parts of the syllabus which have already been covered. 
There are 54 questions in 2 hours and most of them are from previous EASA papers, or are 
very similar.  It is a representative and realistic exam.

Why Conical Charts?
We have seen that the Mercator chart has many powerful properties, but it does have 2 
limitations. These are:
•	 Great Circles are not projected as straight lines.
•	 The chart is not constant scale. Indeed, scale changes quite rapidly on a Mercator chart. 
Navigators wished to maintain Rhumb Line tracks for the first 400 years or so or the life of 
the Mercator chart, because they were steering by compass, and therefore needed to have a 
constant track direction.
However, that situation started to change from about 1960 onwards, when automatic 
computing became available. It is possible to calculate a desired Great Circle track direction by 
spherical trigonometry formulae, and the computers built into INS, IRS, FMS and GPS do this 
as a matter of course.
If the aircraft is going to be steered along a Great Circle, it would be helpful to have a chart on 
which a Great Circle is a straight line. Otherwise the aircraft will appear to go off track in the 
middle of the leg, then recover back to track again. 
If the scale were to remain constant on a chart, we could measure distances with a ruler instead 
of having to use a pair of dividers, and having to open the dividers to different distances at 
different latitudes. For aviation, it is useful to be able to use a ruler - most aircraft do not have 
a large plotting table like a ship.
Background to the Lambert Projection
The basis of the Lambert projection is the simple conical. However, the simple conical projection 
has some limitations, not least that it is not orthomorphic. A Swiss mathematician called 
Johann Heinrich Lambert made some modifications to the basic conic in 1777. The result is the 
orthomorphic, near constant scale Lambert’s Conformal Conic Chart.
The approach taken in the initial part of this chapter will be firstly to derive some of the 
properties of the simple conic projection. Some of these, particularly the chart convergence, 
are also found in the Lambert projection. We will next examine why Lambert made his changes 
and what effect they had. We will then finish up with the properties of the Lambert projection.
The Simple Conic Projection - Convergence
It is possible to project the graticule of the Earth on to the inside surface of a cone. This process 
gives the conical family of projections from which Lambert’s is derived.
A cone is placed over a Reduced Earth, in such a way that the cone is tangential with the 
Reduced Earth along a parallel of latitude. The apex of the cone will lie on the extended line of 
the Earth’s axis as shown in Figure 21.1.

Figure 21.1     The principle of simple conical projection
A light source at the centre of the Reduced Earth casts shadows of the graticule on the inside 
surface of the cone.
These shadows could be marked in, the cone removed, cut down its slant side and rolled out 
flat to give a simple conical projection as illustrated in Figure 21.2.
On the simple conical projection, scale is correct on the parallel of tangency, in this example, 
45°N. This parallel, on which scale is correct, is called the ‘Standard Parallel’. Scale expands on 
either side of the Standard Parallel.
Figure 21.2 illustrates that when the cone is flattened 360° of longitude are represented in 
a sector of a circle of 255 degrees, in this case. The size of the segment is controlled by the 
parallel of latitude chosen to be the parallel of tangency - the higher the latitude chosen the 
larger will be the sector.

Lambert’s Conformal Chart - 1

Lambert’s Conformal Chart - 1
Look at Figure 21.3. The parallel of tangency is 45N. You can see that if you take this parallel 
as the base of a triangle formed by the cross-section of the cone, you get an isosceles triangle, 
with the angle at the apex being 90°. On the other hand, if we had taken a parallel of tangency 
of 60N, the angle at the apex would have been 120°. The ultimate case is a parallel of tangency 
of 90N - the North Pole. In this case we would get a flat sheet of paper and the angle at the 
North Pole would be 180°. The angle at the apex of the triangle is always twice the parallel of 
tangency.
Figure 21.3     Apex angle is twice parallel of origin
The apex angle is also known as the angle of the cone. It is the angle of the cone which 
determines the arc of the sector formed by laying the cone flat. In the ultimate case, a 90° 
parallel of tangency gives a 180° cone angle, which gives no missing gap at all. If the parallel of 
tangency is at a high latitude, say, 60N, then the paper sector forms quite a large arc and the 
‘missing’ sector is small. At a parallel of tangency of 45N the sector is 255°, making the ‘missing’ 
sector 105°.
The relationship of the sector formed to the original 360° of longitude change is determined 
by the sine of the parallel of origin.
	
arc of sector      =   change of longitude  ×  sine of parallel of origin
	
	
	
    =   360°  ×  sine 45°
	
	
	
    =   255°
What we are saying here is that 360° (which is the change of longitude between the 180°E 
and the 180°W meridian in Figure 21.2 - going the long way round - not across the gap) is 
represented by 255° of angle of inclination between the meridians as drawn on the simple 
conic chart.
	
angle of inclination of meridians  =  ch.long  ×  sine of parallel of origin 
The angle of inclination of the meridians is known as chart convergence. Therefore:
	
chart convergence  =  change of longitude  ×  sine of parallel of origin 
This gives a general relationship, which is illustrated as follows:

Figure 21.4     Ch.long v chart convergence over 100°
In Figure 21.4, a change of longitude of 100° is represented on the chart by an angle of 
inclination of the meridians of (100° × sin 45°), which is 70.71°. In Figure 21.5, a change of 
longitude of 10° is represented on the chart by an angle of inclination of the meridians of (10° 
× sin 45°), which is 7.071°.
The sine of the parallel of origin is called “the constant of the cone” and is represented by the 
symbol “n”.

The Simple Conic Projection - Scale
On the simple conic projection the scale is correct at the parallel of tangency - the paper touches 
the Reduced Earth at this point.
Figure 21.6     Correct scale
However, the scale expands away from the parallel of tangency rather rapidly:-

Lambert’s Conical Orthomorphic Projection
Lambert modified the simple conic in order to reduce this rapid rate of scale change.
Instead of doing this:	 	
	
	
       He did this:
Figure 21.8     
(a)   Simple Conic
(b)   Lambert
Lambert made the cone of his projection go 
inside the Reduced Earth.
The scale is now correct at these 2 points.
These are now called the Standard Parallels.
Figure 21.9     Lambert - correct scale
--- Page 347 ---
21
341
Lambert’s Conformal Chart - 1
21
Lambert’s Conformal Chart - 1
The scale expands here: (the yellow parts).
It contracts here: (the yellow part).
This has had the effect of evening out the scale error, making it more of a constant scale chart. 
This new projection has two standard parallels on which the scale is correct. The old parallel of 
tangency of the simple conic is renamed the parallel of origin of the new projection, and scale 
is least on this parallel, just as it was on the simple conic.
Outside the standard parallels scale is greater (more expanded) than it is on the standard 
parallels, whilst between them scale is less (contracted), being least of all on the parallel of 
origin.
In Figure 21.12 the standard parallels are 43°N and 47°N and the parallel of origin is 45°N. The 
upper standard parallel appears one sixth of the way from the top of the chart and the lower 
standard parallel, one sixth of the way from the bottom of the chart.
This is the ‘one sixth rule’, and ensures minimum scale variation over the sheet.

Figure 21.12     Part of a Lambert conical orthomorphic chart
Lambert Chart Convergence
In the simple conic the angle of the cone was twice the latitude of the parallel of tangency. This 
fixed the chart convergence, making it the change of latitude times the sine of the parallel of 
tangency.
In making the cone go inside the Reduced Earth, Lambert did not change the cone angle. You 
can either think of it as keeping the cone angle constant and reducing the size of the cone, or, 
equally validly, just pushing the same cone downwards a bit.
If the cone angle has not changed, then neither has the ‘n’ factor, or constant of the cone. The 
chart convergence remains the same. This was originally defined by the parallel of tangency, so 
in the Lambert chart it is defined by the parallel of origin.
Thus the scale is correct at the standard parallels, but the convergence factor is defined by the 
parallel of origin.

Non-perspective Chart
Having brought the cone inside the Reduced Earth, it was necessary to make some mathematical 
adjustments in order to make the chart orthomorphic.
The Lambert projection is a non-perspective chart.
Lambert Chart Properties
Scale
This is least on the parallel of origin. It expands away from the parallel of origin, until it is correct 
on the standard parallels. Scale is greatest on the top and bottom parallels of the projection.
Orthomorphism
The chart is orthomorphic by mathematical construction.
The meridians converge:
But the parallels curve:
When you put them together, they cut at right angles.

Graticule
Meridians are straight lines radiating from the pole. Parallels of latitude are arcs of concentric 
circles, all of which are centred at the pole. The pole is usually off the map sheet which you are 
using. The map sheet is shown as a red broken rectangle here.
Parallel of Origin
Figure 21.13     
The parallel of origin is the mathematical basis of the projection. It defines the chart convergence. 
It is half-way between the 2 standard parallels. The sine of the parallel of origin is called ‘the 
constant of the cone’ and is denoted by the symbol ‘n’.
Chart Convergence
Unlike on the Earth, the meridians of a Lambert projection are straight lines.
Therefore, also unlike the Earth, the convergence between 2 given meridians does not change 
with latitude.
Figure 21.14     Chart convergence
All angles the same
The formula for calculating chart convergence is: -
Chart Convergence = change in longitude × sine parallel of origin.
--- Page 351 ---
21
345
Lambert’s Conformal Chart - 1
21
Lambert’s Conformal Chart - 1
Since the meridians are straight lines, the chart convergence between two selected meridians 
will not change with latitude. In other words, chart convergence is constant on a Lambert chart. 
This is shown in Figure 21.14, where the meridians through, A, C and E, have been paralleled 
through B, D and F, respectively, forming angles marked ‘CC’ which are all equal to each other.
Rhumb Lines
Except for meridians which appear as straight lines, Rhumb Lines are curves concave to the 
pole of the projection (parallels of latitude).
Great Circles
Except for the meridians which appear as straight lines, Great Circles appear as curves concave 
to the parallel of origin. A straight line in an ‘east-west’ direction most nearly represents a 
Great Circle when drawn between two positions on the parallel of origin. The following series 
of diagrams explain why:-
Imagine a spherical Earth, (i.e. the real Earth or a Reduced Earth).
The meridians converge towards each other with increasing latitude.
Now imagine 3 Great Circle tracks at different latitudes.
Figure 21.15     Great circles on real Earth
What will happen when we project this real Earth situation onto a Lambert chart with a parallel 
of origin of 45°N?
The Earth meridians are straightened out into straight-line chart meridians. This means that 
the formerly straight-line Great Circles are stretched outwards at latitudes higher or lower than 
the parallel of origin.

21
Lambert’s Conformal Chart - 1
Chart Convergence = Earth 
Convergence at the Parallel 
of Origin
So Great Circles are straight lines at the parallel of origin and curves concave to the parallel of 
origin at any other latitude.
Figure 21.17     Great circles on a Lambert chart
However, the amount of curvature from the straight line is exaggerated in Figure 21.17 simply 
to make the explanation clearer. In fact there is very little curvature compared with a straight 
line and, for all practical purposes, including plotting, Great Circles on a Lambert chart may be 
treated as straight lines.
The amount of curvature on a Rhumb Line is far greater than a Great Circle. We will return to 
this point in the next chapter.

Constant Scale
As we have seen, the Lambert chart is not completely constant scale. Scale expands outside 
the standard parallels and contracts inside them. However, the whole point of Lambert’s 
modification was to reduce the rate of scale change.
For practical purposes, we regard a chart as being ‘constant scale’ if the amount of scale 
distortion does not exceed 1%. This means that you can measure distances with a ruler and 
they will be 1% or less in error. This is good enough for most applications in aviation.
Some published Lambert charts meet this specification and others do not. You can measure 
distances with a ruler on the UK CAA 1:500 000 topographical maps very accurately (there is 
about 0.1% maximum error), but there is about 3% scale error on the Jeppesen ED-6.
The amount of scale error depends on the separation of the standard parallels. You are not 
required to know the formula or the amount of scale error but, just to give you a feel for 
what are and are not constant scale charts, the following table lists the scale error for various 
latitude differences.

The SPs on the Jeppesen series which includes the ED-6 are 37N and 65N, a separation of 28°. 
This explains the percentage scale errors.

Earth Convergence and Chart Convergence
Earth convergence (also known as convergency) is the difference in inclination between 2 
meridians on the Earth:

or the change in direction of a great circle track between 2 meridians on the Earth.

the formula is ca = ½ ch.long × sin mean lat.

are concave to the parallel of origin on the Lambert projection.
Imagine a Lambert chart. Take 2 meridians, say, 20° apart. Now consider 3 different latitudes, 
say, 47N, 45N (parallel of origin) and 43N.
Figure 22.7    
Draw straight lines joining the meridians at these latitudes.
Figure 22.8    Straight lines
Now consider the rhumb line in each case.
the difference between the rhumb line and the straight line will be ½ chart convergence and 
is equal to ½ ch.long × sin parallel of origin.
	
½ × 20° × .7071 = 7.071°          in all 3 cases!
Now calculate the angle that the great circle makes with the rhumb line. this is conversion 
angle, and is ½ ch.long × sin mean latitude for each line
Calculating this value gives us 3 different answers, one for each latitude.

CA47N  =  ½  ×  20°  ×  sin 47°  =  7.314°
	
CA45N  =  ½  ×  20°  ×  sin 45°  =  7.071°
	
CA43N  =  ½  ×  20°  ×  sin 43°  =  6.820°
Look at the conversion angles in Figure 22.9. You can see that they are different for each 
latitude.
Plotting the conversion angles in at the other end and joining them up gives us the great circle 
track paths.
this shows why a great circle appears as a straight line at the parallel of origin but is concave 
to the parallel of origin at any other latitude. the straight lines always make the same angle to 
the rhumb line, whatever their latitude, but the angle that the great circle makes to the rhumb 
line  depends on its latitude.

Lines Parallel at Mid-meridian
If two positions are joined by a straight line, a great circle, and rhumb line on a Lambert chart, 
they are all parallel to each other at the mid-meridian.
Figure 22.11   Measuring at mid-meridian
The Advantages of a Lambert Chart
Great circles can be treated as straight lines for all practical purposes.
Radio bearings are great circles, so can be plotted without application of conversion angle. 
You still need to apply convergence by paralleling the NDB’s meridian from the aircraft’s DR 
meridian position, but no calculation is involved - this is explained below.
If scale error is small, a graduated ruler can be used to measure distances.
The Disadvantages of the Lambert Chart
Flying by compass gives rhumb line tracks, so if great circle tracks are to be flown the aircraft 
must have a system which provides automatic continuous computation of desired track (INS / 
IRS / FMS / GPS), or the aircraft must be steered by gyro (without transport wander correction). 
The graticule is not rectangular and the plotting of positions is not as simple as on a Mercator.
NDB position lines have to be plotted using meridian transfer. This is explained below.
Plotting on a Lambert Chart
Plotting bearings on a Lambert chart is less complicated than on a Mercator because great 
circles (radio waves) are straight or near-straight lines, and so there is no conversion angle 
to apply. However, there may be a correction for chart convergence to apply. It depends on 
whether the bearing is measured at the ground station or at the aircraft.

The bearing measurement process for VDF (QDMs and QTEs) and for VOR takes place at the 
ground station. It may appear with VOR that the bearing is displayed in the aircraft and has been 
decoded in the aircraft, but it has not been measured in the aircraft. The different between the 
VOR reference phase and the bearing phase is encoded at the moment of transmission on that 
particular bearing at the ground station. All that the aircraft VOR receiver does is de-modulate 
the encoded signal and display it. It does not actually measure a bearing, unlike ADF.
For bearings measured at the ground station (VDF or VOR), the plotting process is simple. 
You simply correct for variation at the point where it has been added (the ground station), 
and plot the true bearing from the ground station. This will be the correct great circle track at 
the ground station. the straight-line bearing will change direction with respect to north as it 
crosses meridians and encounters convergence and therefore will not be the same great circle 
track direction at the aircraft, but it is not being plotted from the aircraft, so this does not 
matter. It is the correct radio wave path.
For bearings measured at the aircraft (ADF / NDB and AWR (airborne weather radar)), the 
situation is complicated because there is convergence between the meridian where the bearing 
is measured (the aircraft) and from where it will be plotted (the NDB). Consider the situation 
at Figure 22.12. An aircraft measures a bearing of an NDB of 245°(R) while on a heading of 
025°(T). It is required to plot the position line on a Lambert chart.
Adding together the relative bearing of 245° and the true heading of 025° gives the true great 
circle bearing of the NDB from the aircraft, 270°.
But if the reciprocal, 090°, is plotted from the meridian of the NDB, the position line will not 
pass through the aircraft position, as	 the meridian through the aircraft is not parallel to that 
through the NDB.  See Figure 22.12(a).
Figure 22.12   Plotting an ADF bearing
If, however, the angle of 090° is measured from a line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian drawn 
through the NDB, the position line will pass through the aircraft as shown in Figure 22.12(b).

Chart convergence has been automatically allowed for by drawing a line parallel to the aircraft’s 
meridian through the NDB. This method is always used in plotting.
If it is necessary to obtain the bearing to plot from the meridian of the NDB, reference to Figure 
22.12(b) will show that in this case it is equal to 090° minus chart convergence.
Example
An aircraft flying, in the Northern hemisphere, on a heading of 330°(T) measures a bearing of 
090°(R) of an NDB. 
What is the bearing to plot on a Lambert chart:
	
a.	
from a line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian drawn through the NDB?
	
b.	
from the meridian of the NDB? Chart convergence is 3°.
Solution
	
a.	
330° + 090°(R) = 060°(T)
(True great circle bearing of NDB from aircraft) Plot 240° from a line parallel to the aircraft’s 
meridian drawn through the NDB. See Figure 22.13(a).
	
b.	
Bearing to plot from meridian of NDB

Note that, in the case of bearings measured at the aircraft, it is the aircraft’s compass which 
is used to add to relative bearing in order to obtain true bearing. Therefore, if the heading 
is magnetic and it is necessary to correct it to True, we always use variation at the aircraft.
Bearings measured at ground station (VOR, VDF) - variation at ground station
Bearings measured at aircraft (NDB/ADF, AWR) - variation at aircraft

Example 1
Two points A and B are plotted on a Lambert chart and joined by a straight line, which from the 
meridian of A measures 250°(T). Given that the chart convergence of the meridians through A 
and B is 6°, what is:-
	
a.	
the rhumb line track from A to B?
	
b.	
the approximate great circle bearing of A from B, as given by the straight line, 
measured from the meridian of B?
Assume Northern hemisphere.
Solution
The angle between the straight line and the rhumb line is ½ chart convergence = 3°
	
a.	
250° - 3° = 247°(T).
	
b.	
The rhumb line bearing of A from B is 247°(T) - 180° = 067°(T). 
The ‘straight line’ bearing therefore is 067° - 3° = 064°(T).
Example 2
The straight line from A to B, both of which are in the Northern hemisphere, is plotted on 
a Lambert chart and cuts the mid-meridian in the direction of 300°(T). Measured from the 
meridian through A, the direction of the straight line is 302°(T). What is:-
	
a.	
the rhumb line track from A to B?
	
b.	
the chart convergence of the meridians through A and B?
	
c.	
the approximate GC bearing of A from B, as given by the straight line?
Solution
	
a.	
Rhumb line and straight line are parallel at the mid-meridian.
Therefore rhumb line track from A to B	
 =  300°(T) 
	
b.	
Straight line at A	
	
=	
302°(T)
Rhumb line	
	
	
=	
300°(T)
So ½ chart convergence	
=	
2°
So chart convergence	 	
=	
4°
	
c.	
Rhumb line bearing of A from B	
=	
120°(T)
½ chart convergence	 	
	
=	
2°
So approx. great circle bearing	
=	
118°(T)

The Polar Stereographic Chart
Introduction
The polar stereographic projection is, of those discussed, the only geometric projection, i.e. 
true perspective projection. It is constructed using the principle shown in Figure 23.1.
A flat surface is used, touching the North Pole (the point of tangency). The light source is 
positioned at the South Pole (diametrically opposed), creating a graticule, by geometrical 
projection, which is shown in the lower part of the diagram.
Figure 23.1     A Polar stereographic projection
Polar Stereographic Graticule.
The meridians are straight lines, radiating from the Pole. The parallels are concentric circles. 
However, they are not evenly spaced. Their spacing from the Pole depends on the scale 
expansion from the Pole.
To determine this, we need to introduce the concept of the co-latitude. The co-latitude is 
simply (90° - the latitude). Therefore, if the latitude is, say, 60°, the co-latitude will be 30°.
Now consider the light paths in Figure 23.1. Take the light which passes through the Equator. 
The Equator’s latitude is 0°, so the co-latitude is 90°. Half of the co-latitude is 45°. In the triangle 
formed by the light path above, the opposite and the adjacent are both the radius of the 
Earth, so we have a right-angled triangle with a bottom angle of 45°.
--- Page 372 ---
The Polar Stereographic Chart
23
366
23
23
The Polar Stereographic Chart
It can be shown by a geometrical proof that the angle that the light path makes with the axis 
of the Earth is always a function of half the co-latitude. You are not required to understand 
the proof, but you should remember the result, which is that the scale expands away from the 
Pole at a rate of the secant squared of half the co-latitude.
Therefore:	
scale expansion  =  sec2 (½ co-latitude)
In Figure 23.2 you can see that the meridians are straight lines, and the parallels are concentric 
circles. However, the spacing between the parallels is increasing as the distance from the Pole 
increases.
The Equator can be projected so that a hemisphere or more can be shown on one chart.
Figure 23.2     Polar stereographic graticule
Polar Stereographic Properties
The properties of the Polar Stereographic chart are analysed below:-
Scale
The scale is correct at the Pole (where the paper touches the Reduced Earth). Elsewhere it 
expands as the sec2 (½ co-latitude).
The equation to find scale at any latitude is as follows: (Not examinable in the EASA ATPL 
exam).
	
scale at any latitude = scale at Pole × sec2 (½ co-latitude)
We will now substitute a particular value of latitude, 78°, and see how this changes the scale.
Assume that the scale at the Pole is 1/1 000 000.
	
scale at 78°  =                      ×  sec2 (½ co-latitude)
1 
1 000 000
--- Page 373 ---
23
367
The Polar Stereographic Chart
23
The Polar Stereographic Chart
If the latitude is 78°, then the co-latitude is 12°. Half the co-latitude is 6°. The equation therefore 
becomes:
	
scale at 78°  =                      ×  sec2 (6°)
1 
1 000 000
This can be written as:
	
scale at 78°  =                      ×  sec (6°)  ×  sec (6°)
1 
1 000 000
or, alternatively:
	
scale at 78°  =                      ×                 ×   
1 
cos 6°

0.989074
1 
989 074
1 
1 000 000
In other words, between latitudes 90° and 78°, the scale is within 1% of the scale at the Pole, 
which can be regarded as a constant scale chart. 
A similar exercise can be carried out for the latitude of 70°. Out to 70° the scale is within 3% of 
the scale at the Pole.
To summarize:
Between latitudes 90° and 78° - scale within 1% of scale at Pole.
Between latitudes 78° to 70° - scale between 1% and 3% of scale at Pole.
This constancy of scale makes the polar stereographic projection an almost ideal map for flying 
in polar regions. With the breakdown of former political rivalries and the advent of aircraft 
of long range and endurance, ETOPS procedures, and inertial navigation systems, it has now 
become common to use polar routes, which are often shorter, and some go very close to the 
Pole indeed. Consider the situation at Figure 23.3.

23
The Polar Stereographic Chart
Take the 1% scale zone. The co-latitude of 78° is 12°. Therefore, the distance from the Pole to 
latitude 78° is 60 NM × 12 = 720 NM. If the aircraft is entering at one side and leaving more or 
less on the opposite side of the circle, the total distance in the 1% zone is around 1400 NM. 
At typical jet-liner speeds of around 450 knots TAS, that is approximately 3 hours flying time.
A chart which can be considered constant scale and allows measurement of distances with a 
ruler for over 3 hours flying is a very useful projection.
Orthomorphism
Meridians are straight lines originating from the pole. Parallels of latitude are arcs of circles 
centred at the pole. The expansion is at the same rate in any direction from any point. Therefore 
the projection is orthomorphic.
Graticule
Meridians are straight lines originating from the pole. Parallels of latitude are arcs of circles 
centred at the pole.
Shapes
Because of scale expansion, shapes and areas will be distorted away from the pole.
Chart Convergence
The meridians converge at the pole at exactly the same rate as they do on the Earth’s surface. 
Therefore, on the projection the convergency remains the same, whereas on Earth it decreases 
away from the Pole.
This gives the Polar stereographic chart a convergency factor, or ‘n’, of 1. The chart convergence 
is always exactly equal to the change of longitude between 2 points, whatever the latitude.
Chart convergence is constant all over the chart.
Chart convergence is ‘correct’, i.e. same as the Earth only at the Pole.

Rhumb Lines and Great Circles
Figure 23.4     Great circle, rhumb lines and straight lines
In Figure 23.4 a Rhumb Line, a Great Circle and a straight line on the chart have been drawn 
between longitudes 000°E/W (the Greenwich Meridian) and 090°E, at 2 different latitudes, 
50°N and 70°N.
As with the Lambert chart, the Rhumb Line has the greatest curvature. A parallel of latitude 
must cut meridians at right angles. Rhumb Lines are always concave to the pole of projection.
As with the Lambert chart, the Great Circle is concave to the parallel of origin. It is just that, 
on this chart, the parallel of origin is the pole. Therefore, Great Circles are also concave to the 
pole of projection, but the amount of curvature is less than the Rhumb Line in the same 
hemisphere.
It is possible to calculate the difference between a Great Circle and a straight line at any latitude, 
in order to see how closely a straight line approximates to a Great Circle. The angle between 
the straight line and the Rhumb Line is half chart convergence, whilst the angle between the 
Great Circle and the Rhumb Line is conversion angle (half Earth convergence).
At 50°N, the angle between a straight line and a Rhumb Line is half chart convergence. Over a 
90° change of longitude, this is 45° for a Polar Stereographic chart (‘n’ = 1). The angle between 
the Great Circle and the Rhumb Line is conversion angle, which is ½ ch.long × sin mean latitude 
- ½ × 90 × 0.766 = 34½°.

The Polar Stereographic Chart
23

23
The Polar Stereographic Chart
Difference between straight line and Great Circle = 45° - 34½° = 10½°.
This is a large initial difference and therefore it would not be possible to approximate a straight 
line to a Great Circle at this latitude over this change of longitude. However, if we were flying 
directly over the Pole, then both the straight line track and the Great Circle track would initially 
be 000°, then 180° and there would be no difference. So the amount of change of longitude 
obviously makes a difference.
At 70°N, the angle between a straight line and a Rhumb Line over a 90° change of longitude is 
also 45°. The angle between the Great Circle and the Rhumb Line is conversion angle, which is 
½ ch.long × sin mean latitude - ½ × 90 × 0.9397 = 42.3°.
Difference between straight line and Great Circle = 45° - 42.3° = 2.7°.
Therefore, at 70°N, even in the worst case (90° change of longitude) there is less than 3° 
difference between the straight line and the Great Circle. This shows that the difference 
between a straight line and a Great Circle becomes smaller as the latitude increases.
With any other change of longitude at 70°N, the difference will be even smaller, falling to zero 
for a track directly over the pole. A straight line may be taken to be a Great Circle on a Polar 
Stereographic chart at latitudes greater than 70°.
Uses of a Polar Stereographic Chart
The chart is used mainly for plotting in Polar regions. Grid and gyro steering technique is usually 
used as well, not only because of the projections but also because of proximity to the North 
Magnetic Pole.
Some meteorological charts are on this projection or on a modified polar stereographic.
The chart is also used for planning purposes (shows the Pole and Equator if desired).

Straight-line Track Problems
Example 1: What is the initial straight-line from A (75N 60W) to B (75N 60E) on a Polar 
Stereographic chart?
a.	
090°T) 
b.	
030°(T) 
c.	
120°(T) 
d.	
330°(T)
Answer: Start by drawing a diagram of the situation.
The ‘n’ factor of a Polar Stereographic chart is 1 - meridians which are 1 degree apart in 
longitude will have an angle of inclination to each other of 1 degree. As the longitude of A is 
60W and the longitude of B is 60E, meridians A and B are inclined to each other at 120°.
We also know that A and B are both at latitude 75N. Therefore the co-latitude in each case is 
15°, i.e. the distance from the Pole to A is the same as the distance from the pole to B. So we 
have an isosceles triangle.
Figure 23.5     Polar stereo situation
120°
The internal angles of a triangle must add up to 180°. If 120 of them are at the apex, that leaves 
60 of them to be split equally between A and B (it is an isosceles triangle, remember). So angles 
A and B are both 30°.
Now, the direction from A (or any other point on the Earth’s surface, for that matter) to the 
North Pole is due north, 000°(T). Therefore the direction from A to B is 030°(T). The answer is 
(b). 
Although the question did not ask it, we can also work out the straight line track angle from B 
to A. In this case, the direction from B to the North Pole is also 000°(T), also known as 360°(T) 
and the direction from B to A is 30° left of 360°(T), so it must be 330°(T).

The Polar Stereographic Chart
If the track angle from B to A is 330°(T) at B, going back to A, then it must be the reciprocal, 
150°(T), going from A to B as it passes over B. In other words, the straight-line track A to B 
starts with a track angle of 030°(T) and finishes on a track angle of 150°(T). We have shown 
from the geometry of the triangle that the track angle increases by 120°. We should expect 
this - the chart convergence from A to B is 120°, due to the longitude change of 120° and the 
‘n’ factor of 1.
There is another way of solving this problem - by use of the Rhumb Line. If latitude A is 75N and 
latitude B is 75N then the Rhumb Line track between them is the parallel of latitude of 75N and 
therefore must have a Rhumb Line track of 090°(T).
The chart convergence between 60W and 60E is 120°. Therefore half chart convergence is 
60°. This is the difference between the Rhumb Line and the straight line. Therefore 60° anti-
clockwise from the Rhumb Line track of 090°(T) gives us an initial straight-line track of 030°(T).
Figure 23.6     Polar stereo situation - rhumb line track
120°
The same method would work for finding the track from B to A, measured at B. At B, the 
Rhumb Line track to A is 270°(T). Sixty degrees clockwise from 270°(T) is 330°(T).
Example 2: At what longitude does the straight-line track from A (70N 40W) to B (70N 80E) 
on a Polar Stereographic chart reach its highest latitude ie the Great Circle Vertex?
a.	
040W 
b.	
030W 
c.	
020E 
d.	
040E
Answer: Start by drawing a diagram of the situation.

The highest latitude occurs at the shortest co-latitude distance, i.e. the shortest distance from 
the Pole. This shortest distance to the Pole must be when the line between the Pole and the 
track is at right angles to the track, as in Figure 23.8.
This must occur at mid-meridian -  at 020E.
Answer (c).

Example 3: On a Polar Stereographic map, a line is drawn from position A (70N 102W) to 
position B (80N 006E). The point of highest latitude along this line occurs at 035W. What is 
the initial straight-line track angle from A to B, measured at A?
a.	
049°(T) 
b.	
077°(T) 
c.	
229°(T) 
d.	
023°(T)
Again, start by drawing a diagram:
This is clearly a new sort of problem, because A and B are at different latitudes. There appears 
to be no isosceles triangle or right-angled triangle.
Figure 23.9     
However, we have not used all the information in the question yet. The point of highest latitude 
must have some significance otherwise presumably the examiner would not have mentioned 
it. So let us draw that in:
Now we have a right-angled triangle, between A, the North Pole, and the point of highest 
latitude. Angle b is the difference between 035W and 102W, so it is 67°. Angle c is 90°. The 
internal angles of a triangle must add up to 180°. So angle a must be 23°.
Answer ‘d’.

Time General
Why do pilots need to study time? There are 2 main applications:
You should know why different countries keep different times and how to find what the 
standard time is in any country you may land in. Most laymen (and some pilots when using the 
Public Address to passengers) call this the ‘local time’, but the correct term is ‘Standard Time’.
You need to be able to work out when it gets dark in different parts of the world at different 
times of the year (or when it gets light in the morning), especially if the airport of destination 
does not have airfield lighting.
Time Basics
Our measures of time are based on the Earth’s rotation about its own axis, the Earth’s rotation 
around the Sun, and the movement of the solar system in our galaxy and the movement of our 
galaxy in the Universe. We therefore need to know something about elementary astronomy.
Solar System - Planetary Orbits - Kepler’s Laws
The solar system consists of the Sun and major planets (of which the Earth is one).
Planetary orbits (and therefore the Earth’s orbit) are governed by Kepler’s laws of planetary 
motion which are:
•	 The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the foci.
•	 The line joining the planet to the Sun, known as the radius vector, sweeps out equal 
areas in equal time.
•	 The square of the sidereal period of a planet is proportional to the cube of its mean 
distance from the Sun.
The important laws, the first 2 above, are illustrated in the following diagram:
Figure 24.1     Kepler’s laws
--- Page 386 ---

Time (1)
Kepler’s First Law
A planet travels around the Sun in an elliptical orbit as shown. The Sun is at one of the foci, 
F1, of the ellipse as indicated (the second focal point is shown at F2 but may be ignored). 
Because of its elliptical orbit, the planet will be at its closest point at P, known as ‘perihelion’ 
(Greek peri - near, helios - sun). At position A, the planet is at a point furthest from the Sun 
known as ‘aphelion’. Perihelion occurs in early January (approx 4th). Aphelion occurs in early 
July (approx 4th).
Kepler’s Second Law
At position B, the planet approaches ‘aphelion’ (A) and the radius vector SB will sweep out the 
area SBA in the time between B and A. However, a corresponding situation at Q as the planet 
approaches ‘perihelion’ (P) requires the radius vector SQ (which is shorter than SB) to move 
faster than SB to ensure that the area SQP has the same area as SBA. Thus the planet moves 
faster around its orbit near perihelion than it travels around its orbit near aphelion.
In summary, in an elliptical planetary orbit, the orbital speed is fastest at perihelion and 
slowest at aphelion.
The Earth’s orbital situation as viewed from the North Celestial Pole (NCP), i.e. the point in the 
sky directly above geographic North Pole, is illustrated in Figure 24.2.
Figure 24.2     Earth orbit
Notes:  The Earth rotates about its geographic N/S axis in an anticlockwise direction when 
viewed from the NCP. This rotation determines our measurement of a ‘day’, (to be discussed 
later.)
The Earth orbits the Sun in an anticlockwise direction when viewed from the NCP. The orbital

period determines our measurement of a ‘year’. The changing orbital speed affects our 
measurements of a day (to be discussed later).
The Seasons
It is a common misconception that the changes of seasons are governed by the Earth’s distance 
from the Sun. This is not true. As the Sun’s heat is transmitted radially, the effect of the 
distance change between 91.4 million statute miles at perihelion and 94.6 million statute miles 
at aphelion would only be to change the amount of heat received by the Earth by about 3%, 
not enough to explain the marked changes between the summer and winter.
The predominant cause of the Seasons is the inclination (tilt) of the Earth. The Earth’s axis 
is inclined (tilted) at an angle of 66.5° to its orbital plane and this is often stated as 23.5° to 
the normal to the orbital plane (90°- 66.5° = 23.5°).
Figure 24.3     The Earth’s orbit
Adding the inclination of the Earth to a diagram of the Earth’s orbit as in the figures below 
illustrates the annual seasonal changes.

The Sun appears vertically above 23½°S on the 21st of December. This is known as:-

The Sun crosses the Equator from South to North on about 21st March. This is known as:-
	
NH - Spring Equinox	
SH - Autumn Equinox
Six months later it crosses the Equator from North to South on about 21st September.
	
NH - Autumn Equinox	SH - Spring Equinox
During the period of one day the Sun appears to move along a parallel of latitude from East 
to West.
A simplified diagram is given below for definition purposes.
Figure 24.5    Earth’s orbit (side view)
In the diagram above, the plane of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun is labelled the ‘Plane of 
the Ecliptic’. This is an adequate definition although some textbooks refer to the Ecliptic as 
the plane of the annual path of the Sun.
The plane of the Equator is called the ‘Plane of the Equinoctial’. (Equal day/night but see 
later).
--- Page 389 ---
24
383
Time (1)
24
Time (1)
The Plane of the Ecliptic and the Plane of the Equinoctial are inclined to each other at an 
angle of 23.5°. (This angle is called the obliquity of the ecliptic).
At a given time of year, the angle that the Sun is above or below the Equator determines 
the season and affects the length of daylight/night. The angle is known as DECLINATION. 
Declination is analogous in the sky to latitude on the Earth.
The Sun’s declination changes annually between 23.5°N (Sun overhead the tropic of Cancer) 
through 0° (Sun overhead the Equator) to 23.5°S (Sun overhead the Tropic of Capricorn) and 
then back through 0° to 23.5°N. The annual cycle of the Sun’s declination is illustrated in the 
diagram below. When the sun, or any planet, is overhead an observer at an altitude of 90° it 
is at its Zenith.
Figure 24.6    Declination of the Sun
°

°
The declination of the Sun may be considered to follow a sine wave with its peak amplitude 
being 23.5° and its cyclic period being one ‘year’.
You may notice that the dates of the solstices and equinoxes may be quoted in some textbooks 
as about 21st, 22nd, of the appropriate month. This occurs simply because the precise date 
depends on the relationship between the year considered and the leap year cycle. Students are 
not expected to be able to calculate the precise date of these solar events.
The length of daylight/night at a given latitude varies with the declination of the Sun. The 
rate of change of the length of daylight will therefore be greatest when the rate of change of 
declination is greatest. The diagram shows that this situation occurs at the equinoxes (about 
Mar 21 and Sep 21).
The above situation is not true in several special cases, which will be discussed later. These are 
when the latitude considered is either the Equator or is above 66°N/S.

Measurement of Days and Years
A ‘day’ may be defined as the length of time taken for the Earth to rotate once about its axis 
measured against a celestial body, (the Sun or a star). Measurements against a star are called 
‘sidereal’ and against the Sun are called ‘solar’.
‘Civil’ Day
A ‘civil’ day should be:
•	 Related to periods of light and darkness so that 1200 hrs is always about halfway between 
sunrise and sunset. The civil day should therefore be based on the Sun.
•	 Of a constant length.
Sidereal Day
A sidereal day is measured against a distant star and is of nearly constant length. However, it is 
not related to light and dark and is not suitable as a civil day.
Apparent Solar Day
An apparent solar day is measured against the real or apparent Sun (the one that ‘appears’ 
to you). However, using the apparent (real) Sun introduces the problem of the apparent solar 
day not being a constant length.
Consider the situation including the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, illustrated in the diagram 
below showing the Earth’s orbit viewed from the North Celestial Pole (NCP). The NCP is an 
imaginary point at a distance along the continuation of the Earth’s axis from the S pole to the 
N pole projected out into space.
Figure 24.7    Sidereal day/apparent solar day
--- Page 391 ---

Time (1)
24
Time (1)
Consider the Earth at position A but in a solar system where the Earth was stationary. An 
observer at position Z would have the Sun and a distant star directly over his meridian. After 
one complete anticlockwise rotation of the Earth, the Sun and the star would be over the 
observer’s meridian again. The apparent solar day and the sidereal day (based on the star) 
would be equal. This is a false situation.
In the period of one 360° revolution, the Earth travels around its orbit to position B. After a 
360° revolution, the distant star is again over the observer’s meridian (a sidereal day) but an 
additional rotation and further orbit to position C is needed to put the Sun again over the 
observer’s meridian. Thus:
An apparent solar day is longer than a sidereal day.
But, as stated before, the Earth’s orbital speed changes throughout the year.
Thus, an apparent solar day cannot be of constant length.
Mean Solar Day
The mean solar day is the average length of an apparent solar day (averaged over the year).
It is of constant length and related to light and darkness; it is used as the ‘civil’ day and is 
divided into hours, minutes and seconds of ‘mean’ time.
It is sometimes helpful to think of the Sun travelling westwards around the Earth rather than 
the Earth spinning eastwards. In the case of mean time, we consider the mean (average) Sun 
circling the Earth every 24 hours. This is the basis of Local Mean Time (LMT).
The maximum difference between mean time and apparent (real) Sun time is about 16 
minutes and occurs in mid-November. A second maximum occurs in mid-February at about 
14 minutes difference. In between these maxima, the difference reduces. The difference is 
known as the Equation of Time.

In November, the real Sun crosses an observer’s meridian at 1144 whereas the mean Sun crosses 
the meridian 16 minutes later at 1200 LMT (by definition).
In February, the real Sun crosses a meridian at 1214 whereas the mean Sun crosses 14 minutes 
earlier at 1200 LMT (by definition).
Year
A Sidereal Year is the time taken by the Earth to complete an orbit of the Sun measured 
against a distant star. Its length is 365 days 6 hrs.
A Tropical Year (an apparent solar year) is the length of one cycle of the seasons. Its length 
is 365 days, 5 hrs and 48.75 minutes.
A Calendar Year is normally 365 days. It is kept in step with the tropical year by adding a 
day every 4th year, a ‘leap’ year. A fine adjustment is made on 3 occasions every 400 years. 
(At a centennial, when the first 2 numbers of the century are not divisible by 4, the leap year 
is omitted.)
Hour Angle
The Declination of a celestial body (in our case, the Sun) has been shown to be similar (analogous) 
to latitude. In the same way, Hour Angle can be shown to be analogous to longitude.
The Earth spins in an easterly direction, 360° in every 24 hours. Thus, a celestial body (the Sun 
or a star) will transit across a given meridian at 24 hour intervals. It is convenient to simplify 
this situation by considering that the celestial bodies circle the Earth in westerly directions. 
The Sun rises in the East and travels in a westerly direction to set in the West and continues 
westerly to eventually rise again in the East.
The Hour Angle of a celestial body is defined as the arc of the Equator (equinoctial) 
intercepted between the meridian of a datum and the meridian of the body, measured 
westwards from 0° to 360°.
Thus when a celestial body transits a given meridian, its Hour Angle is 000°. When the body 
transits the anti-meridian, its Hour Angle is 180°. If the given meridian is Greenwich, the 
Hour Angle is known as the Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA) which is directly analogous to 
longitude. A body with a GHA of 050° will be transiting the 050W meridian. A body with 
a GHA of 180° will be transiting the 180W meridian. But a body with a GHA of 270° will be 
transiting the 270W meridian, or the 090E meridian.

Conversion of Arc (Angle) to Time
To solve time problems we need to be able to convert angular arcs to time in hours and 
minutes.
Because the Earth rotates 360° in 24 hrs, we can convert angular arc to time as follows:
360° = 24 hrs
15° = 1 hour
1° = 4 minutes
15’ of a degree of arc = 1 minute of time
15”(seconds of arc) = 1 second of time
Note: You are only required to work to the nearest minute of time. Conversion of angular arc to 
time can be achieved using the table on the last page of the Air Almanac extract (reproduced 
at the end of this chapter). Angular arcs from 0° to 360° are converted to hours and minutes 
of time in the first 5 columns. The final column is used to convert minutes of angular arc into 
minutes and seconds of time.
Example:  Convert 137°36’ of arc to time. Use the arc/time table (see page 414).
137° of arc converts to 9 hours 08 minutes of time.
36’ of arc converts to 2 minutes 24 seconds
The final solution is, 9 hours 10 minutes and 24 seconds, but rounding the answer gives:
Answer:  9 hours  10 minutes
You may not have the arc/time page from the Air Almanac. In this case, you must calculate 
the arc to time conversion. In most cases, the arc of longitude will be in whole degrees.
Example 1:   Convert 127° of arc into time.
Divide 127° by 15 = 8.4667 hours
The answer is now in hours and decimals of hours but the question may required the answer 
to be in hours and minutes
Convert the decimals of hours (.4667) to minutes by multiplying by 60  -  .4667 × 60 = 28
Answer: 8 hours 28 minutes
Example 2:  Convert 096°17’ of arc into time.
Express the arc in decimal form by dividing the minutes by 60. (17÷60) = .283
Arc = 096.283°
Divide arc by 15 to give decimal time
096.283° ÷ 15 = 6.4189 hrs.
Convert decimal hours back to minutes
.4189 x 60 = 25 minutes (to the nearest minute)
Answer: 6 hours 25 minutes

These problems are most easily solved using the dms function of a scientific calculator. 
We recommend that, in problems that appear in this book, students calculate the arc/time 
conversion and practise using the dms function on the calculator. Answers can then be checked 
against the arc/time table from the Air Almanac.
Example:  Convert 137°36’ of arc to time.
The actual buttons to be pressed depend on which particular calculator you have bought. With 
the Casio series that Oxford recommends, the dms button is marked ° ’ ”. To convert arc to 
time, press the following sequence:
1 3 7 (dms) You will then see 137° in the window.
3 6 (dms) You will then see 137° 36° in the window.
÷ 1 5 = You will then see  9°10°24  -  9 hours, 10 minutes, and 24 seconds.
Local Mean Time
The Earth rotates daily around its geographic axis, anticlockwise if observed from above 
the North Pole. It is convenient sometimes to consider the Earth as stationary and the Sun 
travelling around the Earth once a day in a clockwise direction. This alternative fits well with 
our perception that the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West. For further discussions, this 
alternative will be used and, unless otherwise stated, the Sun referred to is the ‘mean’ Sun.
When the mean Sun transits (crosses) a particular meridian, the Local Mean Time (LMT) at 
all places on that meridian is 1200 hrs (midday, noon).
Similarly, when the mean Sun transits the anti-meridian of a point, the LMT at the point is 
0000hrs (2400hrs) or midnight. Conventionally, midnight of a particular night, say the night of 
the 6th/7th, is regarded as 2400hrs LMT on the 6th or 0000hrs on the 7th.

Figure 25.1     Local Mean Time (LMT)
Figure 25.1 illustrates the situation when the mean Sun is transiting (crossing) the meridian of 
45E on 16th May (the date is chosen simply for illustrative purposes). Thus the LMT at all places 
on the 45E meridian (Baghdad, Aden, Madagascar) is 1200 LMT on 16th May (local mean date).
Remember, it takes the Sun 1 hour to travel 15° of longitude.
At 45E, the LMT is 1200 hrs on 16th May, (the Sun is crossing the meridian of 45E).
At 90E (approx India) the LMT is 1500 hrs on 16th May (the Sun passed the meridian 3 hours 
ago : 45 = 3 × 15 = 3 hrs)
At 135E (approx Japan) the LMT is 1800 hrs on 16th May.
At 180E (mid-Pacific in the Eastern hemisphere) the LMT is 2100 hrs on 16th May.
Now working to the west from the 045°E meridian.
At 0E/W (the Greenwich Meridian), the LMT is 0900 LMT on 16th May.
LMT at the Greenwich Meridian is known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) also called Zulu 
‘Z’, which used to be the Earth’s standard time. The present standard time is called Co-
ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which for all practical purposes is the same as GMT.
At 45W (Newfoundland) the LMT is 0600 LMT on the 16th May.
At 90W (mid USA), the LMT is 0300 LMT on the 16th May.
At 135W (Alaska), the LMT is 0000 LMT on the 16th May. This time may be considered to be 
also 2400 hrs LMT on the 15th May.

At 180W (mid Pacific in the Western hemisphere), LMT is 2100 LMT on the 15th May. But, 
from the previous argument, at 180°E, the LMT is 2100 LMT on 16th May.
Thus:
At the 180° meridian, the LMT date changes by a day although the LMT time remains the 
same. Thus:
Travelling westward across the 180° meridian, the LMT date increases by one day. Travelling 
eastward across the 180° meridian, the LMT date decreases by one day.
This situation is illustrated in Figure 25.2 using an LMT at Greenwich of 0300 LMT on the 19th 
(0300 UTC on UTC date 19th).
Figure 25.2     LMT 2
Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC)
Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) changes at a constant rate and is regulated against 
International Atomic Time (IAT) derived from atomic clocks. UTC is regularly corrected to 
match GMT (the LMT at the Greenwich Meridian) but the corrections are very small. For all 
practical navigation purposes, UTC equals GMT. UTC is the datum for world time.
It is often necessary to convert LMT into UTC or vice versa. Based on the fact that the Sun 
appears to travel across the Earth from east to west, the following rule applies:
	
Longitude east, UTC least (less advanced)
	
Longitude west, UTC best (more advanced)

Local Mean Time/UTC Problems
Note that in basic LMT problems, the latitude is unimportant. For instance, all points on 
the 75W meridian have the same LMT. This example includes Ottawa (Canada), Philadelphia 
(USA), Kingston (Jamaica), Bogota (Colombia) and Lima (Peru).
We recommend that students lay out problems logically and always work through UTC as in 
the examples below.

Zone Time (ZT)
Although UTC is the worldwide time datum for aviation purposes, it has little civil use far from 
the Greenwich meridian. Humans tend to rise some time in the morning and go to bed some 
time in the late evening. On a cruise ship in mid Pacific, it would be disappointing if you chose 
to go up on deck to sunbathe when your watch was reading 1000 hrs UTC! This problem was 
recognized centuries ago and the system of Zone Time (ZT) was used to keep ships’ time in 
synchronization with the periods of light and dark.
Zone Time was based on the fact that the Sun transits 15 degrees in one hour. The datum for 
the Zone Time system was the Greenwich Meridian (0E/W). All ships within longitudes 7.5W 
and 7.5E would keep a Zone Time the same as GMT (UTC). The correction from Zone Time to 
GMT (UTC) would be zero.
Ships between longitudes 7.5E to 22.5E would have a Zone Time one hour later than GMT 
(UTC). This zone was numbered -1, the correction to be applied to Zone Time to calculate GMT 
(UTC). Similarly, ships between longitudes 22.5E to 37.5E would be in the zone numbered -2. 
The numerical labels continue as minus values up to 180E.
For ships in the Western hemisphere, a similar system applied. Thus, ships at longitudes between 
7.5W and 22.5W would be in the zone numbered +1, i.e. the zone time is earlier than UTC 
and 1 hour must be added to Zone Time to calculate UTC. The numerical labels increase as 
plus values to 180W.

The system is illustrated in the following diagram:
Figure 25.3     Zone time
•	 Earth divided into 25 zones of 15° longitude (1 hour), except the 2 semi-zones M & Y adjacent 
to the International Date Line.
•	 Each zone is 7.5° about a central meridian, firstly the Greenwich Meridian then every 15°. 
Zones are assigned a letter (see above).
•	 Zone time varies from UTC (Z time) by increasing periods of 1 hour counting east (+) or west 
(-) from ‘Z’ (eg Singapore = zone G {+7 hr].
Zone Time Calculations
You may be required to calculate the zone number for a given longitude or to convert between 
Zone Time and UTC.
To calculate the zone number, divide the longitude given by 15 and round to the nearest whole 
number with .5 rounding up. Easterly longitudes have negative (minus) zone numbers from -1 
to -12. Westerly longitudes have positive (plus) zone numbers form +1 to +12. Remember, the 
zone number is applied to the Zone Time to give UTC. To convert from UTC to Zone Time, the 
+/- signs need to be reversed. These rules can be confusing and it may be easier to remember:
If it’s midday in London, it’s evening in the Far East and morning in the Wild West.
Or we are having
‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s (New York), Lunch in London, Tea in India’.
Mathematically:
UTC = Zone Time + Zone Number

Example 1
What is the zone number for position A, 40S 137E, and position B, 60°00’N 097°30’W? 
Note: latitude is irrelevant in these cases.
Position A	
Zone number   = 137° ÷ 15
	
	
	
	
= 9.13 hrs
	
	
	
	
= 9 hrs (rounded to nearest whole number).
Longitude E is negative
Zone Number of position A = -9
Position B	
Longitude 097°30’W = 97.5W 
	
	
Zone number 	 = 97.5 ÷ 15 = 6.5 hrs
 	
	
	
	
= 7 hrs (.5s round up)
Longitude W is positive
Zone Number of position B = +7
Example 2
At position 10S 130E, the Zone Time is 0600 ZT on Zone Date 01 Jan 00. What is the UTC?
Zone Number 	= 130÷15 = 8.66
	
	
= -9 (East)
UTC = Zone Time + Zone Number
	
	
= 01 0600 (ZT) Jan + (-9)
	
	
= 31 2100 UTC December 99
Example 3
At 0300 UTC on 17 May, what is the Zone Time and date at 20N 155W?
Zone Number	 = 10.33
	
	
= +10 (West)
UTC = Zone Time + Zone Number
Therefore: Zone Time = UTC - Zone Number
	
	
= 17 0300 May - (+10)
	
	
= 16 1700 May
Examples 2 and 3 have been completed above using an algebraic notation in the equations. 
Common sense should tell you that in Example 2, the UTC should be less than the Zone Time. 
Similarly, in Example 3, the Zone Time should be less than the UTC.

Standard Time
Zone Time (ZT) gives a convenient standard for ships at sea, keeping the hours of the day 
approximately synchronized with daylight and darkness. However, the system would not be 
appropriate for use on land. For example, the 7.5E longitude line runs through the middle of 
Nigeria - it would be inconvenient if western Nigeria kept a time 1 hour in advance of eastern 
Nigeria.
Similarly, Local Mean Time (LMT) is inappropriate for use in a country as a standard time. In 
UK, we would have a situation where at 1200 LMT in Greenwich, the time at Oxford (001°20’W) 
would be 1155LMT and the time in Penzance (005W) would be 1140 LMT. This situation did 
exist up until the mid-1800s in the UK when lines of communication were slow. With the advent 
of the railway system, the need for a standardized system was recognized. Indeed, in those very 
early days, train guards leaving London carried a watch set to Greenwich time. At each station 
out of London, the station clock would be reset to the guard’s watch (GMT) and, subsequently, 
church wardens would set church clocks to the station clock, i.e. to London time. Thus, each 
town in the UK set its clocks to a standard time for the country; this was the foundation of the 
Standard Time (ST) system.
For the UK, the Standard Time (ST) is UTC (GMT) at all times of the year. In summer, we 
adjust our clocks forward 1 hour and refer to the time as British Summer Time (BST), a time 
which is one hour added on to our Standard Time (UTC). Summer Time/Daylight Saving Time 
corrections are discussed later in these notes.
Each country nominates its own Standard Time (ST), normally notified in the Air Almanac as a 
correction to UTC. Clearly, each country aims to fix a Standard Time such that 1200 hr ST occurs 
about the middle of the period of light and 0000 hr ST in about the middle of the period of 
darkness. Thus Standard Time will be close to both Local Mean Time (LMT) and to Zone Time 
(ZT) but will not be exactly the same.
Standard Time corrections for most countries are listed in the Air Almanac on pages 1 to 4 
inclusive. Countries are listed in 3 general areas:
List 1 (pages 1,2)	
	
Countries generally to the east of the Greenwich meridian.
List 2 (top of page 3)	 	
Countries close to or on the Greenwich meridian.
List 3 (pages 3,4)	
	
Countries generally to the west of the Greenwich meridian.
Note: The Air Almanac extract issued for exam purposes is a copy from a 1992 Air Almanac. 
Country names, (for example USSR) may have changed and the corrections may also have 
changed. For exam purposes, the extract should be treated as valid.
List 1
List 1 (pages 1,2) gives Standard Time Corrections for countries mainly east of Greenwich, 
whose Standard time will be ‘fast’ on UTC, i.e. Standard Time is later than UTC time. The 
note under the title shows how the corrections should be applied; time corrections given 
should be added to UTC to give Standard Time, or subtracted from Standard Time to give 
UTC.
Countries with a large E-W extent may be subdivided. Thus, Standard Time corrections for 
Australia change depending on the state involved. EASA questions about countries like 
Australia will specify the state involved. Also, the USSR is divided by states; EASA time questions 
involving the USSR will give the state of the place concerned.

Some countries do not carry an exact number of hours as a correction. This choice is entirely at 
that country’s discretion. Also there are a few unusual corrections: Chatham Island at 12 hrs 45 
min. and Tonga Islands at 13 hrs. These latter countries are actually in the Western hemisphere, 
and the corrections are made because the countries involved wish to keep the same day as 
their neighbours in the Eastern hemisphere. This is discussed later in this section.
List 2
List 2 countries (top of page 3) are places close to the Greenwich Meridian which normally 
keep UTC as their Standard Time. Note that this list includes Great Britain.
List 3
List 3 countries (pages 3, 4) are those countries generally to the west of Greenwich whose 
Standard Time is ‘slow’ on UTC, i.e. less than UTC. The corrections given should be subtracted 
from UTC to give Standard Time or added to Standard Time to give UTC.
Some countries, (for example Canada) are divided by province, and even within some of those 
provinces (Northwest Territories) the correction is further subdivided by longitude. ATPL 
questions involving these areas will provide all the necessary detail. The USA is divided by states 
with Alaska being sub-divided by longitude. You do not need to use terms such as ‘Eastern 
Standard Time’ which are not given in the Air Almanac.
An anomaly does exist in the USA listing for the Aleutian Islands given as 10 hrs, but this will 
be discussed later.
Summer Time/Daylight Saving Time (DST)
Some countries in all lists may carry Summer Time or Daylight Saving Time (DST) (USA) in the 
summer months. This is normally indicated by an asterisk * against the country listed. Summer 
time is normally 1 hour in advance of Standard Time. Thus if the Standard Time in UK in June 
is 1200 (UTC), the British Summer Time is 1300 BST. If the Daylight Saving Time in New York, 
USA in June is 0900 DST, the Standard Time is 0800 ST.
Exam questions will clearly indicate if Summer Time/Daylight Saving Time corrections are to 
be applied. However, if a country is listed with an asterisk (*), read the notes at the bottom of 
the page.
Standard Time Anomalies
Remember, Local Mean Time and Zone Time always change by a day at the 180°E/W 
meridian. Thus, it would be logical to conclude that Standard Time changes by 1 day at the 
180°E/W. This is not always so.
In List 1, Chatham Island (44°S 176°W) approximately 400 NM south-east of New Zealand, is 
listed with a correction of 12 hours 45 minutes. The island is administered by New Zealand and 
populated by New Zealanders (and sheep). However, it lies in the Western hemisphere whereas 
New Zealand lies in the Eastern hemisphere. Thus, Chatham Island’s date should be one day 
earlier than New Zealand’s date, e.g. when it is Sunday on Chatham Island, it will be Monday in 
New Zealand. This is administratively inconvenient. To correct the problem the ‘dateline’ which 
should be on the 180E/W meridian is moved to the east so that, instead of being 176W, the 
island is considered, for time, to be at 184E. The adjusted dateline is known as the International 
Date Line - a line generally following the 180E/W meridian but occasionally adjusted to east or 
west for political/administration purposes.

A similar situation occurs with the Tonga Islands. The Tonga Islands (22°S 170°W) are part of 
the same Pacific Island group as Fiji (17°S178°E) and wish to keep the same day despite being 
in different hemispheres. Using the dateline of 180E/W, Tonga would have to keep a time one 
day earlier than Fiji. To overcome this problem, the International Dateline is moved further east 
to keep Fiji and Tonga on the same Standard Time day.
An Interesting Example
Example:
If the Local Mean Time (LMT) in the Tonga Islands (22°S 170°W) is 0800 LMT on local mean 
date 10 May, what is the Standard Time and Standard Date in the Tonga Islands?

Note: Tonga’s Standard Date is one day different (in advance) from its Local Mean 
date. A similar situation exists with Chatham Island mentioned previously and with the 2 other 
anomalies of this type - the extreme far east of Russia and Wrangell Island. In these other cases, 
the International Dateline has also been adjusted. A corresponding situation exists with the far 
western islands of the Aleutian chain which lie in the Eastern hemisphere. Here, the International 
Dateline is adjusted further west to keep the whole Aleutian chain on the same day as the USA.

Summary
LMT is based on the movement of the mean Sun which travels through 15° of longitude per 
hour. UTC is the LMT on the Greenwich Meridian.
Difference in LMT at two places is found by finding the difference in their longitudes and 
converting it into time at the rate of 15° per hour, except where the shorter longitudinal 
arc spans the date line in which case work through UTC. Be prepared to calculate the time 
equivalent of longitude without using the Air Almanac.
Zone Time is in the EASA syllabus. Be prepared to convert longitude into zone number and to 
convert between Zone Time and UTC.
Standard Time is used to prevent the extreme inconvenience of using LMT on clocks. Standard 
Time Differences for all countries are found in Lists 1, 2 and 3 in the Air Almanac. Conversion 
of LMT to Standard Time or vice versa is best done through UTC. LMT problems involving an 
aircraft crossing the International Date Line are also best done through UTC.

The above table is for converting expressions in arc to their equivalent in time; its main use in this Almanac is for the conversion of longitude
for application to L.M.T. (added if west, subtracted if east) to give UT or vice versa, particularly in the case of sunrise, sunset, etc.

Local noon occurs at the same Local Mean Time on all meridians (1200 hrs LMT). It is also 
true to say that the Sun rises at the same LMT at all places on the same parallel of latitude 
and it sets at the same LMT at all places on the same parallel of latitude.
On an imaginary Earth with no tilt and no atmosphere, the Sun would rise at 0600 LMT and 
set at 1800 LMT (and there would be no seasons). However, the Earth’s tilt results in seasonal 
changes and the declination of the Sun affects the length of night and day, i.e. it changes the 
times of sunrise and sunset. The effect varies with latitude. The declination of the Sun varies 
with the calendar. This is illustrated in the next simplified diagrams.
Northern Summer/Southern Winter
Figure 26.1     Sunrise/sunset
This is illustrated for the situation on or about 21 June (Midsummer Day) when the Sun’s 
declination is furthest North, i.e. the Sun is overhead the Tropic of Cancer (23½°N): the Earth’s 
North Pole is tilted towards the Sun.
Ignoring the effects of atmosphere (see later), half the Earth would be in darkness (night).
An observer at R would rotate eastwards as shown. He would experience a short period of 
night and a long period of day. Thus, the Sun must rise earlier than 0600 hours and set later 
than 1800 hours. (In the Northern hemisphere, it is summer).
An observer at S would experience a long period of night and a short period of day. The Sun 
will rise later than 0600 hours and set earlier than 1800 hrs. It is southern winter.
An observer at E (the Equator) experiences equal periods of night and day with sunrise and 
sunset at approximately 0600 hours and 1800 hours respectively. At the Spring and Autumn 
equinoxes the sunrise and the sunset occur approximately at the same time at all latitudes.
An observer at Position X (the Arctic Circle) or further north experiences constant day - this 
is the ‘land of the midnight Sun’. With the effects of the atmosphere included, this occurs at 
anywhere north of 66N on June 21.

In contrast, an observer at position Y (the Antarctic Circle or further south), experiences 
constant night - the Antarctic winter when the Sun never rises.
Northern Winter/Southern Summer
Figure 26.2     Sunrise/sunset 2
A corresponding situation for December 21st when the Northern hemisphere is tilted away 
from the Sun is given below.
The observer at R experiences a short period of day and a long period of night. The Sun rises 
later than 0600 and sets earlier than 1800 hours. It is northern winter.
The observer at S experiences a short night and a long day. The Sun rises earlier than 0600 and 
sets later than 1800. It is southern summer.
The observer at E (the Equator) again experiences equal periods of day and night
The observer at X experiences constant night as do all observers north of X (Arctic Circle)
The observer at Y experiences constant day as do all observers south of Y (Antarctic Circle)
The length of day and night and the timings of sunrise and sunset vary with latitude and with 
the declination of the Sun (the calendar date). At the Equator, periods of day and night may 
be considered to be equal at all times of the year. (Because of atmospheric effects, the length 
of the day at the Equator is approximately 6 minutes longer than the length of the night - see 
later).
Sunrise and Sunset Tables - Methodology
The Air Almanac provides tables from which the LMT of sunrise and sunset can be extracted.
Times are shown for every third day and for various latitudes between 72N and 60S.
If the latitude for which the time of sunrise or sunset is required is not one of the listed latitudes, 
it is necessary to interpolate to the nearest minute of time.
Note: Listed latitudes are 10° apart near the Equator, 5° apart in mid latitudes, and 2° apart in 
high latitudes

Time (3)

Time (3)
Similarly, if the required date is not one of those listed, it is necessary to interpolate to the 
nearest minute. Interpolation is only required to the nearest minute.
Sunrise and sunset problems are really ordinary time problems, the starting point of which is 
the LMT of sunrise or sunset at a given position.
This LMT is extracted from the Air Almanac and is then converted to UTC or Standard Time 
as required using the methods given in the previous chapter. Examples of these problems are 
now given.

Twilight
Before sunrise, there is a period when it becomes light, and after sunset there is a period when 
it remains light. These periods are called generally ‘twilight’. Although the Sun is below the 
horizon, the Sun’s rays are being refracted in from the atmosphere and result in an extended 
period of light. It is therefore worthwhile to consider what we call the ‘horizon’.
Consider an observer at position Q on the Earth’s surface. His ‘Sensible Horizon’ is the tangent 
to the Earth’s surface (ignoring terrain features). This is the horizon that would be ‘sensed’ by 
instruments such as a spirit level.
Figure 26.3     Sensible/visual horizons
Because of atmospheric refraction, the ‘visual’ horizon is below the ‘sensible’ horizon by 
about 34’ of arc (2). When the top ‘lip’ of the Sun passes below the visual horizon, at sunset, the 
centre of the Sun is another 16’ of arc (the radius of the Sun viewed from Earth below the visual 
horizon). Thus the centre of the Sun is approximately 50 minutes of arc below the sensible 
horizon at sunset. As 50’ of arc equates to 3 minutes of time, this means that at sunset, the 
centre of the Sun is already 3 minutes of time below the sensible horizon. An equivalent 
argument would show that, at sunrise, the centre of the Sun is 3 minutes of time below the 
sensible horizon. This explains why the length of day at the Equator is approximately 6 minutes 
longer than the length of night.
Twilight is that period before sunrise and after sunset when refracted light from the Earth’s 
atmosphere gives an amount of illumination. The amount of illumination varies with the 
Sun’s depression below the sensible horizon and with atmospheric conditions.
Civil Twilight
Civil twilight occurs when the Sun’s centre is between 0° 50’ and 6° below the sensible 
horizon. Illumination is such that it is possible to carry out day time tasks without additional 
artificial lighting. For example, a daytime visual approach is possible. This is the only twilight 
period considered in the Air Almanac.

Nautical Twilight
The centre of the Sun is between 6° and 12° below the sensible horizon. (General outlines 
are discernible and the brighter stars are visible).
Astronomical Twilight
The centre of the Sun is between 12° and 18° below the sensible horizon. (Astronomical 
twilight is often considered to be ‘complete darkness’.)
Civil Twilight Tables (Air Almanac)
The LMT of civil twilight is given in the Air Almanac on the intervening pages between the 
sunrise/sunset tables.
The Morning Civil Twilight (MCT) tables give the time when morning twilight starts. MCT ends 
at sunrise. All times are tabulated in LMT.
The Evening Civil Twilight (ECT) tables give the time when evening twilight ends. ECT starts at 
sunset. Again, all times are tabulated in LMT.
The EASA definition of ‘night’ is the ‘period between the end of evening civil twilight and 
the beginning of morning civil twilight, or such other period between sunset and sunrise 
as may be prescribed by the appropriate authority’. An example of the latter proviso of the 
EASA definition is the Air Navigation Order which defines the period of night flying as from 30 
minutes after sunset to 30 minutes before sunrise at the surface.
Duration of Twilight Calculations
To calculate the duration of twilight at a given latitude on a given date, extract the time of 
sunrise or sunset for that date and the time of MCT/ECT on the same date. The difference in 
the corresponding times gives the duration of twilight.
Example
What is the duration of evening civil twilight in New York, USA, (41N 074W) on 19 July?
(AA Page 13) 	 Sunset 19 July (41N)	
=    1929 LMT (interpolate)
(AA Page 14) 	 ECT 19 July (41N)	
=    2001 LMT (interpolate)
Duration of twilight  	 =  2001 LMT - 1929 LMT
	
	
        	
=  32 minutes
Extreme Cases of Twilight
Two extreme cases exist (and are frequently examined) as follows:
•	 Equator
•	 High latitudes (say above 62N/S)
In high latitudes, the Sun may be above or below the horizon all day, or civil twilight may last 
all night.
The following symbols in the Air Almanac indicate these conditions:
	
Sun remains continuously above the horizon.
	
Sun remains continuously below the horizon.
////	
In the period between sunset and sunrise, the Sun is never less than 6° below the 
sensible horizon. In plain English, twilight lasts from sunset to sunrise the next morning.

Twilight at the Equator
It is a romantic, but false idea that after sunset at the Equator, it is dark immediately.
To demonstrate the true situation, consider the path of the Sun as viewed by an observer at 
the Equator on or about March 21st/Sep 21st (the Equinoxes). Looking to the East, the Sun 
will rise and travel apparently vertically upwards until it is directly overhead the observer. It will 
then descend vertically to the western horizon where it will set.
The sunset situation described is illustrated below:
Figure 26.4     Twilight 1
At sunset, at position A, the top edge of the Sun has just passed below the visual horizon. At 
this position, the centre of the Sun is 50’ of arc below the sensible horizon. At position B, the 
centre of the Sun is 6° below the sensible horizon; this is the end of evening civil twilight. The 
duration of twilight is therefore 5°10’ of angular arc - 21 minutes of time - the minimum 
period of twilight at the Equator.

Twilight Between the Equator and 60°N/S
Figure 26.5     Twilight 2
Case (i)
Using the previous illustration, we can demonstrate how the duration of twilight varies with 
latitude. As a baseline, we use the equatorial situation described previously which gave a 
minimum duration of twilight of 21 minutes. This is case (i).
Case (ii)
To an observer whose latitude is farther north than the declination of the Sun (in this example, 
an observer in the Northern hemisphere):
•	 the Sun will rise in the East
•	 the Sun will travel westward.
•	 at 1200 LMT (noon), the Sun will be due south of the observer
•	 the Sun will set in the West following the general path indicated in case (ii).
The duration of twilight will be longer than 21 minutes.
Case (iii)
To an observer whose latitude is farther south than the declination of the Sun (in this example, 
an observer in the Southern hemisphere):
•	 the Sun will rise in the East 
•	 the Sun will travel westward
•	 at 1200 LMT (noon), the Sun will be due north of the observer.
•	 the Sun will set in the West, following the general path indicated in case (iii).
Again, the duration of twilight will be longer than 21 minutes.
In both the above examples, the duration of twilight can be calculated using the Air Almanac.

Twilight in High Latitudes
In high latitudes, the Sun may remain above the horizon all day. Thus, on or about June 21, 
the Sun will remain above the horizon all day at latitudes higher than 66°N. This situation is 
illustrated below. (Remember, in the Southern hemisphere further south than 66°S, the Sun 
will not rise at all.)
Figure 26.6     Twilight 3
The above illustration is based on a 360° time-lapse photograph taken in Lapland in mid-
summer. Using the same diagram, we can illustrate what happens earlier or later than June 21 
when the Sun is lower in the sky. Similarly, the Sun will be lower in the sky as the latitude of 
the observer increases.
Figure 26.7     Twilight 4
In Figure 26.7 the Sun sets at position A and rises at position B. Between the times of sunset (A) 
and sunrise (B), the Sun never goes below 6° below the sensible horizon. Thus it is:
Twilight between sunset and sunrise
This situation is identified in the Air Almanac with the symbol ////

Effect on Sunrise/Sunset/Twilight of Increase in Altitude
The times published in the Air Almanac are in Local Mean Time (LMT) and are published for sea 
level at the appropriate position.
•	 Increase in altitude results in sunrise occurring earlier and sunset later than
published. This is due to the increased visual horizon at altitude.
•	 Increase in altitude results overall in a decrease in the duration of civil twilight. This is 
because twilight is caused by refraction of the Sun’s rays from the atmosphere; the higher 
the aircraft, the less light is refracted from the (reduced) upper atmosphere. For observers 
in the Space Shuttle, the duration of twilight is negligible.

Introduction
Why is grid navigation used? The main reason is that, at high latitudes, the amount of meridian 
convergence becomes significant. Consider the case at Figure 27.1.
A is at longitude 70W. The line defining True North is the line joining A to the North Pole - the 
meridian of 70W. The track AB makes an initial track angle of 020°(T).
So suppose we set off using a compass based on True heading and keep applying the appropriate 
drift to maintain a track of 020°(T).
But as we cross each meridian going eastwards, the direction of True North changes. Relative 
to the ‘top of the map’, i.e. the 12 o’clock position on the page, the direction of North is turning 
anticlockwise. This means that our direction of 020°(T) will also turn anticlockwise on this map.
Figure 27.1     A High latitude track
If we maintain a track of 020°(T), our path over the ground will look something like this:
Figure 27.2     Changing true track

Exactly the same problem occurs at lower latitudes (unless a direct Mercator chart is being 
used), but it is usually not noticed.
Figure 27.3     A Lambert chart
We wish to fly from C to D, which are both at 53N. The mean track is 090°(T). The initial track 
is 082°(T). We are using a Lambert chart. We now have a choice:
1.	
We can maintain a track of 090°(T). If we do, we will still finish up at D, but we will fly 
the rhumb line track. If we were to take a succession of fixes whilst flying, but not alter 
track, they would appear like this:
Figure 27.4     Flying the rhumb line track
	
However, this is not how most navigation actually takes place. The idea of having a 
straight line on your chart is that it is supposed to be the track you are trying to fly. If 
you wanted to fly the rhumb line track, you would use a Mercator chart. So most non-
automatic navigation is done using the other option.

2.	
We can set off on the initial track of 082°(T). We then settle into our normal regular 
cycle of fixing and correcting back to track. After a certain time we take our first fix. 
There will probably be some cross-track error, mainly caused by a combination of the 
following components.
◦◦
Changes in the wind from the forecast value.
◦◦
Inaccurate heading hold.
	
The cross-track error will also include a small component caused by holding a track of 
082°(T) whilst the straight line track has actually altered to, say, 083°(T), but this will be 
completely swamped by other random navigation errors, of which the above will be far 
the greatest components. We do not even notice the cross-track position error caused 
by convergency because it is usually so small at low to medium latitudes.
	
We plot our fix, then use our protractor to make a normal correction to get back to 
track, locally measuring the track near the fix, thereby automatically correcting for the 
convergency. During the course of the leg, the datum track will change from 082°(T) to 
098°(T), but the process happens simply by correcting back to the straight-line track on 
the chart and measuring using the local meridian.

This technique of sweeping the change of track into the normal navigation corrections breaks 
down at high latitudes, however, because the amount of convergency becomes too great to 
ignore. We therefore have to abandon True North as our direction datum and use a grid and its 
associated Grid North on our chart instead. We also have to align our compass to Grid North, 
not True North.
Figure 27.6     Standard North Polar Grid
There are various different methods of selecting the datum direction for Grid North but, for 
the EASA ATPL syllabus, the datum chosen will always be aligned with a nominated meridian 
of longitude (the Greenwich meridian, for instance, in the examples in Figure 27.6 and Figure 
27.7).
If the Greenwich meridian is the chosen datum, 
the grid is known as a Standard Grid. Standard 
grids are widely used in printed grid maps for 
the European area. Another favourite datum 
often used in the USA and Canada is 060W.
At the datum meridian, there is no difference 
between Grid North and True North. As the 
longitude changes further and further east or 
west from the datum, the angle between True 
North and Grid North increases (see Figure 
27.7) because Grid North remains parallel to 
the datum meridian but True North changes 
with the increasing convergency of the 
meridians.

Convergence
In order to obtain a constant straight line track direction, a datum meridian is selected and 
lines parallel to this meridian are drawn at suitable intervals on the chart to form a grid.
The direction of the datum meridian is known as Grid North. The direction of the track 
measured from Grid North is constant and is known as Grid direction.
This enables an aircraft to fly along approximate great circle tracks.
The difference between True direction and Grid direction at any point is known as convergence. 
You should be able to see from Figure 27.7 that it is equal to the chart convergence between 
the meridian at that point and the datum meridian, because grid north will be parallel to the 
datum meridian whilst true north will have changed by the amount of the chart convergence 
between the datum meridian and the local meridian at the point being considered.
Convergence is annotated Easterly when True North lies to the East of Grid North and Westerly 
when True North lies to the West of Grid North.
This enables the conversion of Grid direction to True direction by applying the convergence in 
the sense:
Convergence EAST True LEAST 	
Convergence WEST True BEST
	
GRID	 	
	
CONV

Convergence follows the same pattern of conversion of direction as our previous conversions 
of:-

  Magnetic

Except that it goes on the left-hand side of the columns (if going from True to Compass)

East or West Convergence?
There is a logical way of working out whether convergence will be East or West. It depends on 
whether we are in the Northern or Southern hemisphere and whether the aircraft position is 
East or West of the datum meridian. See the diagram at Figure 27.10.
Figure 27.10     Putting a grid on the Earth
In this diagram, the vertical centre line represents the datum meridian. In this particular figure, 
it is the Greenwich meridian, but it does not have to be. The red lines represent other meridians 
on the Earth and the green lines represent Grid North.

Now consider the top left quarter of the diagram. This represents the Northern hemisphere, 
with the aircraft at some position out to the left, i.e. on a meridian somewhere to the West of 
the datum.
In this quarter of the diagram, except at the 
Equator itself, True North leans to the right 
(the East) of Grid North, like this:
Therefore, by definition, convergence must be 
East.
Now work through the other 3 quadrants of the diagram and we finish up with the following:
Figure 27.12     Direction of convergence
Now that we can convert from True to Grid on the chart, we need to find a method of steering 
Grid direction. This can either be done using a compass or using a gyro.

Steering by Compass
If grid technique is being used because of the problem of meridian convergence at high 
latitudes, then the aircraft may also be fairly near one of the Magnetic Poles. In this case, it 
may not be practical to use a magnetic compass because variation may be changing too rapidly 
or the magnetic field strength may be too weak. However, even at high latitudes this may not 
always be the case. Flying in parts of Northern Canada would probably give a problem, but 
flying in Northern Europe or Northern Russia, for instance, probably would not, because these 
areas are a greater distance from the Magnetic North Pole. So it may be possible, under some 
circumstances, to steer by magnetic compass even when using grid technique.
The problem is not too complicated and is very comparable to the problem of steering True 
heading when using a magnetic compass. When using True steering, we apply Deviation 
to convert the Compass heading to Magnetic heading, then apply the difference between 
Magnetic direction and True direction (Variation). For Grid steering, all we have to do is apply 
Deviation to convert the Compass heading to Magnetic heading, then apply the difference 
between Magnetic direction and Grid direction. We call this Grivation and it is the algebraic 
sum of Variation and Convergence.
If a Magnetic direction is required from a Grid direction, the Convergence and Variation must 
be applied.

      + 	       4°W             =          10°E
Lines on a chart joining places of equal Grivation are named isogrivs.
For some practice, consider the following situation:
A straight line track is drawn between two points on a Lambert or Polar Stereographic chart 
as shown in Figure 27.13.

Now let us see how we would use a magnetic compass to steer a True heading as the variation 
changes, and then we will see that much the same principles can be applied to steering a Grid 
heading.

     Gridded Charts

In Figure 27.14 we have a rhumb line track. 
After correction for drift, we need to maintain 
a True heading of, say, 080°(T). To the west 
of the 3.5°W isogonal, the variation is, to 
the nearest degree, 3°W. To the east of it, 
the variation is 4°W. Similarly, at the 4.5°W 
isogonal, tracking eastwards, the variation 
changes from 4°W to 5°W.
The pilot starts by flying a Magnetic heading 
of 083°(M) in order to maintain a True heading 
of 080°(T). As he crosses the 3.5°W isogonal, 
he alters Magnetic heading to 084°(M), and 
then as he crosses the 4.5°W isogonal, he alters 
Magnetic heading to 085°(M), maintaining a 
True heading of 080°(T).
If a chart is constructed with isogrivs, then the same principles can be used to maintain a Grid 
heading when using a magnetic compass.
Figure 27.15 shows a printed grid chart. The blue graticule is latitude and longitude. The grey 
graticule is the grid. The Blue dotted lines are isogonals. The grey ones are isogrivs.

Grid Graticule
Isogonals
Isogrivs
You can see from the above chart that the rate at which the isogrivs are changing is much the 
same as the rate at which the isogonals are changing, so it is no more difficult, in many parts of 
the world, to fly a Grid heading using a magnetic compass than it is to fly a True heading when 
using a magnetic compass.
Steering by Gyro
However, one of the reasons that we may be using Grid is because the aircraft is at high latitudes. 
In this case, a magnetic compass may be unusable in some parts of the world because the route

Gridded Charts
Gridded Charts
is within the 6 microtesla zone, and the horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field is 
too weak. In other parts, the rate of variation may be changing too rapidly to be usable.
In these cases, we would steer by gyro. The errors of a gyro are Real Drift (also known as 
Random Wander), Earth Rate, and Transport Wander.
Real Drift
Real Drift in INS-quality gyros is of the order of one-hundredth of a degree per hour. However, 
if an INS were fitted, it would not normally be necessary to use Grid, because most INS are 
polar-programmed and can continue to operate in True up to very high latitudes. Nevertheless, 
if no INS is fitted, on a typical modern airline-quality Slaved Gyro Compass, the gyro drift-rate 
will still be only about one-tenth of a degree per hour when operating in DG mode. In this case, 
Real Drift is low enough to be insignificant.
Earth Rate
Earth Rate occurs because the gyro is aligned with True North at some particular meridian. The 
aircraft then rotates with the Earth, along with the meridian, but the gyro continues to remain 
in alignment with the point in space where it was originally aligned. The correction factor 
is 15 × sine latitude degrees / hour. Many modern Slaved Gyro Compasses have a Latitude 
Correction control, which is a knob turned by the crew to be set to the local latitude, and the 
correction is then fed to the gyro. The crew then keep resetting the latitude as it changes.
Transport Wander
Transport Wander is another name for meridian convergence. The gyro is aligned with True 
North at some particular meridian. Then, as the aircraft travels either east or west, the gyro 
remains aligned to the original direction in space, but the direction of the meridians (and 
therefore the local direction of True North) changes. (See Figure 27.10, which also covers this 
case). To operate in True, a correction has to be calculated for this meridian convergence. The 
correction factor is change of longitude × sine mean latitude.
However, to operate in Grid, no correction is required. What is required is a direction that does 
not change with change of longitude - a grid. Therefore we use the gyro, but without any 
correction for Transport Wander (or meridian convergence).
Note: There is, in fact, a small error caused by the difference between Earth Convergence, 
which is the gyro correction, and Chart Convergence, which will depend on the projection and 
the Standard Parallels being used. A correction has to be applied, known as Residual Transport 
Wander. This is fed in either by slewing the gyro or as a fiddle-factor to the Latitude Control, but 
its use is beyond the scope of this course, and is not discussed further.
Therefore, to operate with a gyro in Grid, all that is needed is to align it to Grid North initially, 
then feed in a correction for Earth Rate. Real Drift will be small with a good gyro, and Transport 
Wander will be non-existent (or there may be a small amount of Residual Transport Wander to 
be corrected).
Polar Grids
A gridded chart is invariably used in polar regions. In both the north and south polar areas the 
plotting charts are:
A Polar Stereographic or a *Transverse/*Oblique Mercator. (*Not covered in syllabus)
On each of these charts the 360° of longitude on the Earth are represented by 360° on the 
chart.
--- Page 472 ---
Gridded Charts

     Gridded Charts
27
This property makes these charts ideally suited 
for the use of a standard polar grid which can 
be printed on the charts for all users.
The use of a standard grid eliminates any 
confusion over the alignment of those few 
VOR/TACAN stations which are not aligned 
with Magnetic or True North but with Grid 
North. In the Northern regions the datum 
meridian used is the Greenwich meridian. At 
any True meridian the chart convergency will 
be equal to the longitude with sign reversed.
For example, at 45°W chart convergency = 45°E.
At 45°E chart convergency = 45°W.
Consider a route from A to B in Figure 27.16. The Grid Track is 090°(T)
At 45°W Track	    =	
090°(G)  -  45°E Conv     =   045°(T)
At 45°E Track	     =	
090°(G)  + 45°W Conv   =   135°(T)
In the Southern hemisphere the Greenwich meridian is again used as the datum meridian.
In the Southern hemisphere the chart convergency is always equal to the longitude when a 
standard grid is used.
To maintain the orientation with Grid North at the top, diagrams illustrating the standard 
south polar grid are normally drawn with the 180°E/W meridian at the bottom of the diagram.
From Figure 27.17, Grid Track A to B = constant 
070°(G).
At A long. = 45°W     so conv = 45°W.
070°(G) + 45°W conv  =  115°(T).
At point B long.  =  45°E   so conv = 45°E
070°(G) - 45°E conv  =  025°(T).
At point X track  =  090°(G)
Conv  =  180°E/W
090°(G)  +/-  180°E/W  =  270°(T).

Grid / True Conversion Problems
Northern Hemisphere
Figure 27.18     North Polar Stereographic Projection
Figure 27.18 represents a North Polar Stereographic Projection. Therefore the ‘n’ factor (the 
relationship between the inclination of the meridians and the change of longitude) is 1.00.
Aircraft No 1. Consider Aircraft No 1. Just by inspection of the diagram, you can see its Grid 
heading is 360°(G) whilst the True heading is 270°(T). Therefore the True heading is 90 degrees 
less than the Grid by simple visual inspection.
Now work it out using convergence. If Grid North is at the 12 o’clock position, then the datum 
meridian must be the Greenwich meridian - we now have a Standard Grid. Aircraft 1 is at 
longitude 090°W, which means that the aircraft is west of the datum. From the following 
diagram:
Northern hemisphere, aircraft west of datum, therefore convergence 
east.
Convergence East, True Least
Therefore True heading should be 90 degree less than Grid - which it is. 
Both the convergence formula and the diagram give the same answer.
Now try the same exercise with Aircraft Nos. 2 to 5.

Using convergence - If Grid North is at the 12 o’clock position, then the datum meridian must 
be the Greenwich meridian, i.e. we have a Standard Grid. Aircraft 1 is at longitude 090°W, 
which means that the aircraft is west of the datum. From the following diagram:

Datum	       =    060°W
	
	
What is True Track?
Is the aircraft east or west of the datum meridian?	 Ans:  West (50 degrees West)
Is that east or west convergence?	
	
Ans: 	 From diagram below, Northern 
hemisphere,therefore east convergence
With a Polar Stereo Chart, ‘n’ = 1
so 50 degree change of longitude = 50 degrees convergence
Given: Convergence East, True Least, Grid Track is 132°(G).
Therefore True Track = 132°(G) - 50 degrees = 082°(T)

Or you could use a diagram:
Figure 27.20     Example 1
Plot the aircraft position (45N 110W) - the blue dot on Figure 27.20.
Draw in the datum (from 060W to the North Pole, and continuing) - the red solid line. This 
gives you the direction of Grid North.
Draw in Grid North through the aircraft position (the dotted red line).
Draw in the direction of True North (the blue line).
Now compare the aircraft True track with the Grid track. You can see that the
True track is about 082°(T) - which is the same answer as the arithmetical calculation.
Example 2
	
Aircraft position   28S 118E.
	
True Track  =  042°(T)
	
Grid Track  =  133°(G)
What is the datum meridian?
What is the convergence?
Is the aircraft east or west of the datum?
Answer:  Difference between Grid and True, 
Grid is greater.

If the aircraft is 91 degrees east of the datum and the aircraft is at 118°E, where is the datum?
Answer: 118°E - 91 degrees = 027°E longitude.
Or you could use a diagram:
Figure 27.21     Example 2
Plot the aircraft position (28S 118E) - the blue dot on Figure 27.21.
Draw in the direction of True North (the blue line).
Draw in the True track of 042°(T) (the green line).
The Grid Track is 133°(G). This gives you the direction of the grid (the red dotted line).
Parallel the grid through the South Pole. This gives you the datum meridian.
(Note: These diagrams are only supposed to be sketches, to allow you to visualize the situation. 
They are not intended to be scale drawing solutions. But they allow you to see which way to 
apply the convergence, and then do a numerical calculation).

Plotting
Introduction
So far in your studies you have become aware of two methods of navigation. One is solo-pilot 
VFR navigation based on the 1 in 60 rule. The other is the use of automatic computing systems 
such as INS, IRS, FMS, GPS, and RNAV. However, there is a whole group of aircraft which are 
more sophisticated than light training aircraft but less sophisticated than the full jet airliner 
glass cockpit standard. These aircraft are routinely fitted with VOR, DME, ADF and Slaved Gyro 
Compasses.
For this sort of intermediate complexity aircraft, it becomes necessary to plot on a Radio 
Navigation chart or a specialist plotting chart, usually a Mercator’s chart or a Lambert’s Conical 
Orthomorphic chart. The EASA ATPL requirement is for the use of the Lambert’s Conical 
Orthomorphic and occasionally the Polar Stereographic. Techniques for these charts, but not 
Mercator’s, are given in these notes.
The charts used for most of the questions are the Jeppesen E(LO)1&2 and the E(LO)1A. 
Students sitting the EASA exams are to bring their own copy of each chart because the CAA 
will not provide one at the exam venues.
Equipment
The following items of equipment are required for this section of the course:-
•	 A navigational computer
•	 A navigational straight-edge
•	 Plotting protractor (square type)
•	 Compass/Dividers
•	 2H and HB pencils for plotting and writing, and a soft eraser
Definitions, Abbreviations, Symbols
True or Magnetic?
Plotting is normally carried out using true north as the datum. It is possible to plot some types 
of radio bearing directly in magnetic without converting to true, but usually true tracks and 
bearings are used.
Heading
The direction in which the nose of the aircraft is pointing measured in degrees (000-360) 
clockwise from the true, magnetic, or compass north, abbreviations being Hdg(T), Hdg(M), 
Hdg(C).
•	 If Hdg(M) is given, it must be converted to true by taking into account the variation on the 
chart.
•	 If Hdg(C) is given, it must be converted to true by taking into account variation and deviation.
Fix. The ground position of the aircraft obtained from two or three visual or radio position 
lines, or by radar.
Position Line. A line somewhere along which the aircraft is known to be at a particular time.

Symbols
The standard symbols used in plotting are shown below, with their meanings. You will find it a 
great help to your plotting if you always use these symbols and always record the appropriate 
time of each occurrence.
Position line at 1115 UTC. Plotted as a true bearing
Two position line fix at 1121 UTC
Radar fix at 1510 UTC
DF station, VOR, NDB or VDF facility
The simplest form of plot is obtained by plotting the positions of two fixes. Provided that the 
aircraft has been flying a single heading during the interval between the fixes, a straight line 
joining them represents the track.
Figure 28.1     Track Made Good
NM
A track of this sort determined between two fixes between which one heading only has been 
flown is called a Track Made Good (TMG).
This track made good is easily measured on the chart in the usual way. The distance measured 
along the TMG gives a method of calculating the actual ground speed. In Figure 28.1, since the 
distance flown in 30 minutes is 100 NM the actual ground speed must be 200 kt.

Fixing Position
If an aircraft is to be navigated safely from one position to another, it is necessary to make 
frequent checks on its ground position, and to make any required correction.
A ‘fix’ is a position defined from radio aids whilst a ‘pinpoint’ is a position found by map- 
reading.
Some fixes give a position directly (for instance a GPS fix or a fix from an ATC ground radar) 
whilst others are made from a combination of position lines. A position line is a line, somewhere 
along which an aircraft is known to be at a particular time.
Examples of position lines which are obtainable visually are long straight stretches of railways, 
roads, rivers or coastlines. The position and direction of line can then be transferred to the 
plotting chart.
Position lines can be visual, radio or radar. These can be plotted on charts and represent lines, 
somewhere along which the aircraft is known to be at the time the position line was obtained. 
Any two position lines obtained at the same time will give a fix, for, as the aircraft is known to 
be somewhere along each, it must be at the point where they cut each other.
The plotting of visual position lines is quite straightforward. They are simply drawn in on the 
plotting chart in the same position and direction as on the topographical map. The plotting of 
radio position lines is not quite so straightforward and needs further explanation.
Bearings Measured by a Ground Station
It must be remembered that radio waves follow great circle paths and that all directions 
measured are great circle bearings.
Bearings measured by ground stations are referred to by groups of code letters beginning with 
the letter Q. These are taken from the old ‘Q code’, most of which is now obsolete.
QTE	
The true bearing of an aircraft from a ground station.
QDM	 The magnetic track from an aircraft to a ground station.
QDR	
The magnetic bearing from a ground station to an aircraft. (QDR is the reciprocal of 
QDM).
QTEs are obtainable by an aircraft when a ground station measures the direction in °(T) from 
which a radio signal sent out by the aircraft, approaches it. The direction so measured is passed 
to the aircraft by RT.
QDMs and QDRs are obtained in two ways:-
VDF	
An aircraft sends out a radio signal and a ground station measures a QTE. The ground 
station converts the QTE into a QDR by applying variation at the ground station where 
the measuring is done. Then by adding or subtracting 180° to change it into the form 
of a direction from the aircraft to the ground station, a QDM is obtained.

VOR	
A QDM or QDR, depending on which is selected by the operator in the aircraft, is 
displayed on an indicator in the aircraft.
With VDF, it is obvious that the measuring is done at the ground station.
However, with VOR, the bearing received by the aircraft is also determined at the ground 
station. Since the bearings are measured at the ground station, the variation of the ground 
station is used to convert them to magnetic direction. 
Plotting of VOR Bearings
QDMs and QDRs are magnetic bearings. If the chart has a magnetic north arrow, they can be 
plotted from the magnetic datum. Otherwise, variation must be applied and they must be 
plotted as QTEs (true bearing of aircraft from ground station).
Plotting QDMs and QDRs
With QDMs, apply the reciprocal to convert the QDM to a radial. There now 3 ways to plot it.
You could align the protractor with the magnetic north arrow, if there is one. The problem is 
that these tend to be very short (usually about 1½ centimetres) and it is difficult to align the 
protractor accurately.
A better method is to find the variation from the isogonals, then use your protractor to plot 
the variation at the VOR using the nearest meridian as true north. You now have a magnetic 
north arrow, but a much more accurate one. You can now plot the magnetic radial directly 
without needing to arithmetically apply variation.
However, if the VOR is on an airway, or better still, is used to define several airways, then the 
airway centre lines will be defined by printed radials on the chart. Take, for instance, Shannon 
(SHA 5243.3N 00853.1W) on the E(LO)1 chart. There are radials of 052(M), 071(M), 080(M), 
115(M), and 173(M). Put the centre of your protractor over the VOR symbol and then turn it 
until the 052 on its scale goes through the 052 radial, the 071 goes through the 071 radial, and 
so on. You have now aligned the protractor with the same magnetic north that Jeppesen have 
used and you can now plot a magnetic radial directly.
Alternatively, you can convert the magnetic radial to a true bearing by applying variation 
arithmetically and then plot by reference to the nearest meridian.
Bearings Measured by Aircraft - ADF or Airborne Weather Radar (AWR)
There are 2 sources of bearings measured at the aircraft. One is ADF and the other is Airborne 
Weather Radar (AWR). ADF is the more common and familiar method, but it is possible to use 
AWR in the MAP mode. In this case the normal pencil beam becomes a cosecant2 beam which 
gives a better performance as a map-painting radar and ranges and bearings can be obtained 
from suitable ground returns, particularly headlands and islands.

Plotting               
Plotting
Since the bearings are measured relative to the fore-and-aft axis of the aircraft, it is necessary 
to convert them into true directions by use of the aircraft’s compass. The compass is affected 
by the local variation at the aircraft. Therefore AIRCRAFT variation is used.
ADF.  The measurement of the bearing of the ground transmitter from the aircraft is determined 
by the aircraft. The bearing measured by the aircraft equipment is normally shown as either a 
relative bearing or a magnetic bearing.
Figure 28.2     True and relative bearings
Relative Bearing
This is a bearing measured not from the direction of true or magnetic north, but from the 
direction in which the aircraft is pointing. For example, if an aircraft is heading in the direction 
of 030°(T) and there is a NDB due east of the aircraft, the bearing of the NDB from the aircraft is 
060° (relative). This bearing would appear on a relative bearing indication (RBI) in the aircraft.
It can be seen from Figure 28.2 that adding together the relative bearing and the true heading 
will give the true bearing.
Magnetic Bearing
This is a bearing measured from the direction of magnetic north, and such a bearing would 
appear on a radio magnetic indicator (RMI) in the aircraft. To change this into a true bearing, 
all that is necessary is the application of variation at the aircraft’s position, where the measuring 
is being done.
AWR
An AWR bearing is a relative bearing from the aircraft. This is combined with true heading of 
the aircraft to give a true bearing TO the response, as above. This is then reciprocated to give 
the true bearing to plot FROM the response.

Converting a Relative Bearing into a True Bearing
AWR bearings are always in the form of relative bearings. ADF bearings will also be relative if 
the presentation is on an RBI. It is necessary to convert these into true bearings which can then 
be plotted from the radar response or the NDB, as appropriate.
Apply AIRCRAFT variation to the magnetic heading to get true heading.
Add relative bearing to true heading in order to get true bearing TO the NDB / radar response. 
If the answer comes to more than 360°(T), subtract 360.
Take the reciprocal in order to get the True Bearing to plot FROM the NDB / radar response.

Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)
DME indicates slant range from the ground DME facility to the aircraft. Strictly, this should be 
converted to plan range before plotting but, unless the height is given in the question, it is not 
possible to do so. If the range is more than about 10 NM the difference is insignificant unless 
the aircraft is at high altitude.
Often the question will simply require you to 
combine a VOR bearing with a DME range 
to arrive at a fix, and this is straightforward. 
However, sometimes the question is to derive 
position from 2 DME ranges. This creates a 
problem of ambiguity, because there will be 
2 positions where the ranges intersect.
In a real situation you would probably be able to work out which was the correct intersection 
from a knowledge of your approximate position.

Plotting               
Plotting
However, the exam question will normally tell you your 
heading and whether the ranges are increasing or 
decreasing.
If you are told that the aircraft is heading 270°(T) and 
the ranges are decreasing then you must be in position 
B, because if you were at A, the ranges would be 
increasing.
The ‘Cocked Hat’
The intersection of three position lines usually forms a triangle - called a ‘cocked hat’ - and 
the fix is then taken to be at the point where the bisectors of the angles of the triangle would 
meet. This is shown in Figure 28.3.
The size of the cocked hat is an indication of the probable accuracy of your fix.
Figure 28.3     The Cocked Hat
Climb and Descent
Climb and descent are not really plotting problems, but it is convenient to group them together. 
They can come as 2 types of question, but they are essentially the same problem - to make the 
time taken in a vertical direction in the climb or descent the same as the time taken in the 
horizontal direction. The vertical distance divided by the rate of climb / descent must be the 
same as the horizontal distance divided by the ground speed.
Example 1
At 65 NM from a VOR you commence a descent from FL330 in order to arrive over the VOR at 
FL100. Your mean ground speed in the descent is 240 knots. What rate of descent is required?
	
a	
1420 feet/min
	
b	
1630 feet/min
	
c	
1270 feet/min
	
d	
1830 feet/min
Answer:  65 NM @ 240 knots will take 16.25 minutes. You need to lose 23 000 feet, also in 
16.25 minutes. The required ROD is 23 000/16.25 = 1415 feet per minute.

Example 2
You are homing to overhead a VORTAC and will descend from 7500 QNH to be 1000 AMSL by 
6 NM DME. Your ground speed is 156 knots and the ROD will be 800 feet/min. At what range 
from the VORTAC do you commence the descent?
	
a	
27.1 NM 
	
b	
15.8 NM 
	
c	
11.7 NM 
	
d	
30.2 NM
Answer:  You need to lose 6500 feet @ 800 fpm ROD. 6500/800 = 8.125 minutes in the descent.
156 knots for 8.125 minutes will cover 21.1 NM. You need to be down at 1000 feet 6 NM before 
the DME, so range to start the descent is 27.1 NM.
Answer (a)
Lambert and Polar Stereo Charts - Effects of Convergence
For all practical purposes, a straight line on a Lambert Conical Orthomorphic (conformal) chart 
or a Polar Stereographic chart at high latitudes can be considered to be a great circle. However, 
the type of plotting with which the student is concerned deals with aircraft which fly rhumb 
line tracks.
Measuring Tracks
If an aircraft is to fly from A to B, the two positions are joined by a straight line (great circle) and 
its direction is measured as the mid-meridian to give the rhumb line track on the 1:1 000 000 
scale chart.
Plotting Headings and Tracks
If a known heading or track has to be plotted, this is done using the nearest meridian to the 
position from which it has to be drawn. Any subsequent error is ignored.
Measuring Distances
If, on a particular chart, scale cannot be considered constant, distances must be measured 
using the latitude scale locally.
Plotting Positions
This takes a little longer than on a Mercator chart, because the Lambert graticule is not 
rectangular. The procedure is as follows:-
Mark the longitude of the position to be plotted in the longitude scale to the north and also 
on the one to the south of the position.
Lay a straight edge between the two points.
Using a pair of dividers, plot the latitude along the length of the straight edge, upwards or 
downwards from the nearest parallel of latitude.
Plotting of ADF Bearings
If the ch.long is 2° or more, draw a line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian through the NDB and 
plot as shown in Figure 28.4.  If ch.long is less than 2°, plot from the meridian of NDB. This is 
explained in more detail in the next paragraph.

Plotting               
Plotting
Plotting on a Lambert Chart
Plotting bearings on a Lambert chart is less complicated than on a Mercator because great 
circles (radio waves) are straight or near-straight lines, and so there is no conversion angle 
to apply. However, there may be a correction for chart convergence to apply. It depends on 
whether the bearing is measured at the ground station or at the aircraft.
The bearing measurement process for VDF (QDMs and QTEs) and for VOR takes place at the 
ground station. It may appear with VOR that the bearing is displayed in the aircraft and has been 
decoded in the aircraft, but it has not been measured in the aircraft. The different between the 
VOR reference phase and the bearing phase is encoded at the moment of transmission on that 
particular bearing at the ground station. All that the aircraft VOR receiver does is de-modulate 
the encoded signal and display it. It does not actually measure a bearing, unlike ADF.
For bearings measured at the ground station (VDF or VOR), the plotting process is simple. 
You simply correct for variation at the point where it has been added (the ground station), 
and plot the true bearing from the ground station. This will be the correct great circle track at 
the ground station. The straight-line bearing will change direction with respect to north as it 
crosses meridians and encounters convergence and therefore will not be the same great circle 
track direction at the aircraft, but it is not being plotted from the aircraft, so this does not 
matter. It is the correct radio wave path.
For bearings measured at the aircraft (ADF / NDB and AWR (airborne weather radar)), the 
situation is complicated because there is convergence between the meridian where the bearing 
is measured (the aircraft) and from where it will be plotted (the NDB). Consider the situation 
at Figure 28.4. An aircraft measures a bearing of an NDB of 245°(R) while on a heading of 
025°(T). It is required to plot the position line on a Lambert chart.
Adding together the relative bearing of 245° and the true heading of 025° gives the true great 
circle bearing of the NDB from the aircraft, 270°.
But if the reciprocal, 090°, is plotted from the meridian of the NDB, the position line will not 
pass through the aircraft position, as the meridian through the aircraft is not parallel to that 
through the NDB. See Figure 28.4(a).

If, however, the angle of 090° is measured from a line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian drawn 
through the NDB, the position line will pass through the aircraft as shown in Figure 28.4(b).
Chart convergence has been automatically allowed for by drawing a line parallel to the aircraft’s 
meridian through the NDB. This method is always used in plotting.
If it is necessary to obtain the bearing to plot from the meridian of the NDB, reference to Figure 
28.4(b) will show that in this case it is equal to 090° minus chart convergence.
Example
An aircraft flying on a heading of 330°(T) measures a bearing of 090°(R) of an NDB.
What is the bearing to plot on a Lambert chart: -
a.	
from a line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian drawn through the NDB?
b.	
from the meridian of the NDB. Chart convergence is 3°?
Solution
a.	
330° + 090°(R) = 060°(T) (True great circle bearing of NDB from aircraft) Plot 
240° from a line parallel to the aircraft’s meridian drawn through the NDB. See 
Figure 28.5(a).
b.	
Bearing to plot from meridian of NDB = 240° + 3° = 243°

(b)
In practice, we would not normally use method (b), plotting from the true meridian. For 
practical plotting, we draw in a parallel false meridian, as in method (a).
Note: In the case of bearings measured at the aircraft, it is the aircraft’s compass which is used 
to add to relative bearing in order to obtain true bearing. Therefore, if the heading is magnetic 
and it is necessary to correct it to true, we always use variation at the aircraft.

The Magnetic Compass
A compass is an instrument designed to indicate direction on the surface of the Earth, relative 
to some known datum. The magnetic compass uses the horizontal component of the Earth’s 
field as its directional datum. Unfortunately, the Earth’s field is normally not aligned with 
the true meridian - the most desirable datum from which to measure direction. The angular 
difference between true and magnetic meridians is called the magnetic variation discussed in 
chapter 3.
The purpose of a magnetic ‘steering’ compass in an aircraft is to indicate heading, the direction 
in which the aircraft is pointing.
Magnetic influences - iron/steel components, electric currents - distort the Earth’s field so that 
the compass magnet assembly deviates from the magnetic meridian. This is called compass 
deviation.
The rules for applying variation and deviation to the compass heading indication in order to 
determine true heading are detailed in the Navigation notes.
Direct Indicating Magnetic Compass
This chapter deals with the direct indicating or direct reading magnetic compass, where the 
pilot directly reads his heading in relation to the pivoted magnet assembly.
There are two basic types of direct reading magnetic compasses used in aircraft, the vertical 
card and, less commonly, the grid ring compass.
Figure 29.1     A vertical card compass
--- Page 500 ---

The Vertical Card Compass
The vertical card compass - which is also known as the B-type or E-type - is the direct reading 
compass in general use. It is usually the main magnetic heading reference in light aircraft and 
the standby compass in larger aircraft.
It consists of a circular compass card attached directly to the magnet assembly. This combined 
unit is suspended in liquid within the compass bowl. A vertical lubber line on the glass window 
of the bowl enables the heading to be read off the compass card.
The Grid Ring Compass
The P-type compass or grid ring compass is found on older aircraft. It is more accurate than the 
vertical card compass and is more stable.
It is, however, heavier, bulkier and more expensive. In addition it can only be read in straight 
and level flight, as the grid ring has to be unclamped and aligned with the north reference 
before a reading can be taken against the lubber line.
The grid ring compass also differs from the vertical card compass in that it achieves a greater 
periodicity by the addition of damping wires which also rotate through the compass liquid.
Figure 29.2     A grid ring compass
Compass Requirements
The direct reading magnetic compass contains a pivoted magnet which must be able to align 
itself, and remain aligned, with the horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field. For the 
compass to succeed, certain requirements must be satisfied. The most important of these are 
that the magnet system must be:
•	 Horizontal
•	 Sensitive
•	 Aperiodic

Horizontality
In order to measure direction in the horizontal, the magnets must lie as nearly as possible in the 
horizontal plane during normal straight and level flight. A freely suspended magnet assembly 
would align itself with the Earth’s total field so the magnets would only be horizontal at the 
magnetic equator.
To achieve horizontality, the magnet assembly is ‘pendulously suspended’, the centre of 
gravity of this assembly being lower than its supporting pivot, as shown in Figure 29.3.
Figure 29.3     Equilibrium (Northern hemisphere) viewed from west
In this way, the tilting effect caused by the vertical component Z of the Earth’s field is opposed 
by the weight of the magnet assembly, this equilibrium being achieved at the cost of only a 
very slight residual tilt of the magnets (North-seeking ends down) - by about 2° in mid-latitudes 
- in the Northern hemisphere. (South-seeking ends down in the Southern hemisphere). Figure 
29.3. shows the two turning couples involved.
One is produced by Z which exerts a downward force on the red (North-seeking) end of the 
compass magnet and an upward force on the blue end.
The other couple is produced by the weight W acting downwards through the centre of gravity 
(displaced because of the tilt) and the reaction R acting upwards through the pivot.
For equilibrium, the magnet takes up the amount of tilt necessary to make the couples balance. 
(A third - very weak - couple produced by the horizontal component, H, of the Earth’s field, 
opposing the tilt has been omitted for simplicity).
Sensitivity
The magnet system is required to seek the horizontal component H of the Earth’s field in all 
areas except near the magnetic poles - where the horizontal component is inadequate.
The notes on magnetism show that the ability of a pivoted magnet to align itself with an 
external field - its sensitivity - depends on the strength of the external field and on the magnetic 
moment of the magnet. The weak external field (H) at a place cannot be changed, but the

The Direct Indicating Compass

magnetic moment of the magnet can be increased - by increasing the magnet’s length and/or 
pole strength.
It is, however, undesirable to increase the magnet length so the pole strength is increased by 
using two, four or six short magnets or a circular magnet, made of an alloy which will accept 
and retain the high degree of magnetism required.
Sensitivity is further increased by reducing friction. This is achieved in three ways:
•	 By using an iridium-tipped pivot in a jewelled cup
•	 By lubricating the pivot with the liquid which fills the compass bowl.
•	 By reducing the effective weight of the magnet assembly acting down through the pivot, 
because the liquid that the magnet assembly is displacing is denser than air .
Aperiodicity
The magnetic assembly is required to be aperiodic or ‘dead beat’, which means that it should 
settle down quickly on a steady indication after being displaced by turbulence or manoeuvres.
Any tendency to oscillate must be quickly ‘damped out’. The desired aperiodicity is achieved 
as follows:
•	 Several short magnets are used instead of one longer one. This keeps the mass of the 
assembly near the centre, so reducing the moment of inertia and consequently making any 
oscillations easier to damp out. Light alloy is utilized wherever possible in order to minimize 
the weight of the assembly framework.
•	 The primary purpose of the liquid in the compass bowl is to act as a damping liquid on 
the compass assembly. The grid ring compass dampens oscillations more rapidly than the 
vertical card compass, due to the addition of damping wires. These wires are attached to 
the magnet assembly and also pass through the damping liquid. (See Figure 29.2.)
Serviceability Checks
Compass body.  Check that there is no obvious damage such as dents or cracks. Any lighting 
system should be checked, as should the efficacy of the luminous paint.
Compass Liquid.  The compass liquid should be checked and be free from:
•	 Sediment and discolouration - either of which would indicate corrosion which would result 
in increased pivot friction.
•	 Bubbles - which would probably indicate a leaking seal. Turbulence and manoeuvres would 
cause any bubbles to move about, creating eddies which could disturb the magnet system.

Deviation
Deviation is produced by the iron/steel components in the aircraft. It is the angle between the 
local magnetic meridian and the direction in which the compass magnets are lying.
Deviation is named Easterly (or plus) if the North-seeking (red) ends of the magnets point to 
the East of magnetic North. If the North-seeking ends points to the West of magnetic North, 
deviation is said to be Westerly (or minus).
Deviation varies with heading so it has to be measured on a series of different headings. This is 
usually done by conducting a compass swing (which is fully covered in the chapter on aircraft 
magnetism). Once deviation has been reduced as far as possible, the residual deviation is 
recorded on a compass deviation card, which is located in the aircraft.
During the swing, normal flying conditions should be simulated as far as possible, with engines 
running, electrical / radio services switched on, and the aircraft in a level flight attitude.
It is obviously most important that no ferromagnetic objects such as tools, or watches should be 
placed near the compass as this would introduce unknown amounts of deviation. Furthermore, 
ferromagnetic payloads should be stowed as far away from the compass as permissible within 
the loading limits. With exceptionally large ferromagnetic loads, a compass swing may have to 
be carried out before flight with the load aboard.

Deviation
The compass needle would accurately define the magnetic meridian were it not for the aircraft’s 
own internal magnetism deflecting it. Deviation is the angular difference measured between 
the direction  taken up by a compass needle and the magnetic meridian. Deviation is named 
easterly or westerly depending on whether the North seeking end of the compass needle lies 
to the East or West of the magnetic meridian.

Compass Swing
The basic method of determining deviation is to compare the aircraft’s heading compass 
reading with magnetic heading as defined by a high quality ‘land or datum’ compass.  This 
comparison of aircraft compass and magnetic datum readings is carried out in an area selected 
specifically for this purpose.
Therefore the aims of a compass swing are as follows:
•	 To observe / determine the deviations / differences between Magnetic North (observed on 
a landing compass) and Compass North (observed in the aircraft) on a series of headings
•	 To correct / remove as much deviation as possible
•	 To record the residual deviation which is left after the compass has been adjusted
The magnetic deviation observed during a compass swing can be said to be derived from Hard 
Iron and Soft Iron magnetism and this total field can in turn, for our purposes, be later resolved 
into two further combined components (coefficients B and C).

Hard Iron Magnetism
The total force at the compass position 
produced by permanent hard iron magnetism 
can be resolved into three components.  These 
components will be fixed for a given aircraft 
and will not change with change of heading.
Soft Iron Magnetism
Soft iron magnetism is induced in parts of the aircraft structure 
by surrounding fields - the most important of these being the 
Earth.  The Earth’s field has a vertical  as  well  as  horizontal 
component.  However, again for our purposes we will within 
the constraints of the syllabus only consider vertical soft iron 
(VSI) magnetism (Z is the vertical component of the Earth’s 
field and H is the horizontal component).  The component Z 
has an increasing effect with latitude as the compass magnets 
try to follow  the Earth’s flux lines; therefore, VSI magnetism 
must also vary with latitude. However,  Z is zero at the Equator, 
where the horizontal component H is greatest, so no VSI 
magnetism is induced there.
When we examine the effective positioning of the imaginary 
magnets found when completing a compass swing we must 
remember that we use a real system (the compass) to give 
us aircraft heading and that this readout is affected by these 
magnetic forces which we have gone to some trouble to 
discover.
We can see from Figure 30.3  that the positioning can 
vary,(even  to  the  extent  of  having  two  imaginary magnets 
affecting our compass) but the effect will be easily resolved by 
the compass swing which can cater for any positioning as long 
as we follow the basic rules.
For example we may examine the case where the effect of the blue pole is said to be in the 
nose or forward of the aircraft compass.

Heading North the isolated Blue pole is in the same horizontal 
direction as the Earth’s blue pole and so the needle is not deviated. 
The directive force or alignment of the Earth’s field is being 
augmented by the blue pole, effectively they are pulling together.
As the aircraft now turns right on to 045° deviation begins  to take 
place and as we can see from the table by 090° this has become 
maximum and then  starts  to  become  less  as  we approach 
180°.	
Hdg 045°C
Hdg 090°C
Hdg 135°C
Remember that the blue pole represents a magnetic force which 
on this heading acts along the same line but in opposition to the 
stronger Earth’s field.
On the remaining headings 180° to 360° the effects of the blue pole 
in the nose are as expected i.e. the red end of the compass needle is 
being attracted to the West of Magnetic North giving the maximum 
westerly deviation on 270°.
If the deviations caused by the blue pole in the 
nose are plotted against compass heading, 
a positive sine curve is obtained.  Had the 
blue pole been aft of the compass a negative 
sine curve would have been obtained.  This 
would mean that on a heading of 090° the 
deviation would reach a maximum westerly 
value instead of a maximum easterly value. 
The changes in directive force would also be 
revised, the maximum occurring on 180° and 
the minimum on 360°.

What we have examined here is known for compass swinging as Coefficient B which we could 
view as that component which is resolved along the body of the aircraft. The forces resolved 
follow a simple sine curve which in our case here would be ‘positive’ although negative curves 
occur just as frequently.
Equally we should be able to  see that if a further magnetic 
source is resolved to the right wing, we would achieve a 
positive cosine curve along the same lines and this is more 
usually described as Coefficient C.
The  combination  of  Coefficients  A  (a  mechanical function 
yet to be discussed) + B + C are resolved during the compass 
swing and to some extent can be removed by adjustment but 
other factors are at work here and will probably leave us with 
some errors at the end.

Correction of Coefficients
The principle for correcting coefficients is the same for any system and can be summed up as 
follows:
Coefficient A - a mechanical problem of a displaced lubber line corrected by loosening the bolts 
holding the compass body or in the case of the RIMC the detector unit and carefully turning it 
until the correct heading is in place.
Coefficient B - correction required because of magnetic deviating forces acting upon the DRMC 
or the detector unit and giving errors  known  as deviation. Firstly calculate the error to be 
removed or more correctly the heading you wish to make the compass read and this will be 
done on an Easterly or Westerly heading.
Coefficient C - correction required because of magnetic deviating forces acting upon the DRMC 
or the detector unit and giving errors known as  deviation. Firstly calculate the error to be 
removed or more correctly the heading you wish to make the compass read and this will be 
done on a Northerly or Southerly heading.
We can see that the correction for B and C are very similar but that we must remember to 
apply the sign of the correction properly to ensure an accurate correction to our compass 
system. When the compass swing is completed we of course have to check our work and this 
‘check swing’ is carried out using eight or perhaps twelve points of the compass to allow us 
to derive a compass card that will be placed in the aircraft. This compass card indicates to us 
the residual deviations that we have been unable to resolve within the essentially horizontal 
procedure.  Alternatively, the residual deviations affecting the compass after the completion 
of a compass swing may be shown by the use of a graphical table or a curve constructed from 
the information obtained. Either set of calculations will allow for the placing of a Compass 
Deviation Card near to the compass in the aircraft.
Accuracy Limits
In accordance with CS Ops-1 (European Regulations) the aircraft’s compasses must, after 
correction, be within the following limits:
	
	
Direct Reading Magnetic Compass	 +/- 10°
Change of Magnetic Latitude
	
	
tan dip   =
Z 
H
The changes in deviation due to change of magnetic latitude have to be considered firstly with 
regard to hard iron and secondly to vertical soft iron.
Hard Iron.  The hard iron deviating force, remains constant regardless of change of latitude. 
However, H varies with latitude being maximum at the Equator and zero at the poles.  Thus the 
smaller the directive force H the greater the maximum deviation, caused by hard iron deviating 
force.  Hard iron deviating effect increases towards  the  poles and is minimum at the magnetic 
equator.  The sign of the deviation will be the same in both hemispheres.

To summarize, maximum deviation due to hard iron magnetism is inversely proportional to the 
value of H, which changes with change of magnetic latitude.
Vertical Soft Iron.  The directive force at the compass position is H, whilst the magnetizing 
agent of any VSI component is Z.  The maximum deviation due to VSI magnetism will vary 
inversely as H.
The VSI maximum deviation will vary directly as Z.  Z has no effect on hard iron deviation. 
The maximum deviation produced by VSI magnetism increases towards the magnetic poles.
	
	
Max deviation   =	
=   tan dip
Z 
H
so maximum deviation varies directly with tan dip.

General Navigation Problems
Introduction
The General Navigation exam includes many questions on general principles. They fall into the 
following broad categories:
Triangular problems
Implications of geometry on the Triangle of Velocities
Calculation of Rhumb Line track angles
Cross-track displacement between Rhumb Line and Great Circle tracks
Timing to a beacon
Triangular Problems
Question.  The relative bearing to a beacon is 270°(R). Three minutes later, at a ground speed 
of 180 knots, it has changed to 225°(R). What was the distance of the closest point of approach 
of the aircraft to the beacon?
a.	
45 NM
b.	
18 NM
c.	
9 NM
d.	
3 NM
Answer:  The question does not specify any heading or track, so draw the situation assuming 
that the aircraft is travelling due north. That way, the relative bearing and the true bearing are 
the same.
270°(R)
225°(R)
A
B
C
The angle A within the triangle when the 270°(R) bearing is taken is 90°. Three minutes later, 
the relative bearing is 225°(R), so the angle B within the triangle at that corner is 45°. The two 
of them add up to 135°, leaving 45° remaining (angle C) of the 180° which must make up the 
internal angles of a triangle.
Therefore angles B and C are equal and we have another isosceles triangle. So length AB = 
length AC.
We know that from A to B is 3 minutes at 180 knots, which is 9 nautical miles. Therefore AC, 
which is the closest point of approach to the beacon, is also 9 nautical miles. Answer c is the 
right one here.

Question.  At 1000 hours an aircraft is on the 310° radial from a VOR/DME, at 10 nautical miles 
range. At 1010 the radial and range are 040/10 NM. What is the aircraft’s track and ground 
speed?
a.	
080°(M)/ 85 knots
b.	
085°(M)/ 85 knots
c.	
080°(M)/ 80 knots
d.	
085°(M)/ 90 knots
Answer.  Start by drawing a diagram. This is just a sketch – not a scale drawing. It would be 
possible to solve this question by drawing it out accurately but this is not the ideal method.
Draw a Magnetic North reference arrow, and draw in the two fixes.
40°
50°
  C 
1010 
040/10 
   B 
1000 
310/10 
x
y
A
If radial B is 310°(M), then the angle between Magnetic North and AB is 50°. Similarly the angle 
up to AC is 40° - right-angled triangle. AB and AC are both 10 nautical miles so, again, we have 
an isosceles triangle ABC. The internal angles must add up to 180° and 90 of them are at corner 
A, so the remaining 90° are equally split between corners B and C. Therefore both B and C are 
45°.
There are now several ways of establishing the track angle. The easiest is to consider the left-
hand of the two smaller triangles above. The bottom angle is 50° and angle B is 45°. These add 
up to 95°, so angle x must be 85°. If angle x is 85°, then so is angle y. Angle y is the track angle.
Another way is to say that if direction AB is 310°(M), then direction BA must be 130°(M). We 
know that angle B is 45°, so the track direction is (130 – 45) = 085°(M).

Now for the ground speed.
You can do it by sin or cosine of 45°, using your 10 nautical mile sides for AB or AC, but it is 
easier to find the distance BC using Pythagoras. 
BC2	
=	
AB2	
+	
AC2
so 	
BC	
=	
200 	 	
=	
14.14 nautical miles.
Use your navigation computer to calculate a ground speed if 14.14 NM are covered in 10 
minutes. It works out at 85 knots.
Thus answer b is correct.
Implications of Geometry on the Triangle of Velocities
It is often assumed, wrongly, that if the wind is at right angles to heading or track, there is 
no head or tail wind component. For many problems, especially in Flight Planning, you are 
expected to assume zero wind component.
However, strictly speaking, this is not true. Consider the following question:
Question.  An aircraft is tracking 090°(T) at a TAS of 180 knots. The wind is from due North 
and the wind component is 5 knots head. What will the wind component be if the aircraft flies 
a track of 270°(T)?
a.	
5 knots tail
b.	
zero
c.	
5 knots head
d.	
not possible to tell
Answer.  You could solve this one on your navigation computer, though not easily, and not by 
one of the conventional methods. Put the wind direction (360°) at the 12 o’clock position and 
draw a straight line vertically downwards from the blue circle (about 3 – 4 cm long). Put 180 
knots under the blue circle. Bring the track (090°) up to the heading index to start. Your initial 
drift will be to starboard. Rotate the wind face to the right, select a heading off to the left 
until the amount of difference between heading and track is the same as the drift-line which 
crosses the wind direction at 175 knots ground speed. It is a little difficult to explain without 
a diagram, but try it practically and you will see that it occurs at a heading of 077°, using 13°S 
drift. This gives a wind of 360° / 42. Now apply 360° / 42 to a track of 270°(T) and you will find 
you need to fly a heading of 283°(T). This gives you a ground speed of 175 knots.

We get a headwind of 5 knots whether we track 090°(T) or 270°(T). Why is this? Draw a 
diagram.
A
B
C
This makes it clear that on a track of 090°(T) with a TAS of 180 knots, the ground speed is 
less than the TAS. The hypotenuse will be longer than the opposite or adjacent, to use 
trigonometrical terms. 
If we now reverse the track, we get a mirror image of the situation.
A
B
C
180 knots TAS still gives us 175 knots ground speed - (5 knots headwind).
Answer c is correct.
This shows that a zero head / tail wind component does not occur, strictly speaking, with the 
wind at right angles to track. You can also show, by a similar drawing exercise, that it does not 
occur at right angles to heading. It is rather an academic point for practical purposes, but in 
fact, zero wind component is present when the wind is at right angles to the bisector between 
heading and track. 
Calculation of Rhumb Line Track Angles
You know how to calculate the distance in nautical miles of change of latitude. Also how 
to calculate distance involved in change of longitude using the departure formula. You will 
also need to calculate Rhumb Line track angle using the tangent relationship. This is a typical 
example:-
Question.  What is the Rhumb Line track from A (4500N 01000W) to B (4830N 01500W)?
a.	
315°(T)
b.	
330°(T)
c.	
215°(T)
d.	
150°(T)
Answer.  You have to draw these diagrams as though they were a Mercator chart - a rectangular 
graticule. A straight line will be a Rhumb Line.

The change of latitude from 4500N to 4830N is 3°30’, or 210 nautical miles. To solve the E-W 
distance we use the departure. Strictly speaking, it should be the departure at mid-latitude, at 
4645N in this example. However, in the examples noted so far the changes of latitude are small 
and it does not make a great deal of difference to the departure. In fact, on this example, you 
get an answer slightly nearer to the right answer if you use the departure at 45N.

Therefore 	
angle x

The Rhumb Line track from A westwards along the parallel of latitude is 270°(T), add x to that 
to get 314.7°(T) - answer a.

Timing to a Beacon
Most timing problems require the wind component to be taken into consideration. Ground 
speed is a combination of TAS and head / tail wind component. To get the timing right requires 
the right ground speed. However, what the pilot actually adjusts is the Mach No. or CAS, which 
is directly proportional to TAS, not G/S.
Question.  You are flying at a True Mach No. of .77 in a SAT of -55°C. At 1000 hours you are 
150 NM from a DME with an ETA of 1017. ATC ask you to slow down to arrive at 1021. What is 
your new TMN if you reduce speed at 150 NM distance to go?
a.	
M.72
b.	
M.62
c.	
M.67
d.	
M.59
Answer.  Start by calculating the current ground speed. 150 NM to go in 17 minutes gives 
530 knots G/S. We need to alter the G/S to cover the 150 NM in 21 minutes, which is a new 
required ground speed of 429 knots. 
Avoid the temptation to say that the required new Mach No. must be:
429 
530
New Mach No.	
=	
M.77	 ×	
=	
M.62
You have to take the wind into consideration:-
Old ground speed 	
=     150 NM in 17 min	 =	
530 knots
TAS: 	
	
	
       M.77 @ -55°C	
=	
442 knots 
Wind component	
	
	
	
=	
+88 knots
New required G/S	
=    150 NM in 21 min	 =	
429 knots
Wind component	
	
	
	
=	
-88 knots (reverse sign)
New required TAS	
	
	
	
=	
341 knots
341 
442
New Mach No.	
=	
M.77	 ×	
=	
M.59
Answer d is correct.

c.	
A common mistake here is to set the W/V, then put 200 up at the 12 o’clock 
index and just read the drift and ground speed off.  But that is the answer for 
a HEADING of 200.  The question asks for a TRACK of 200.  You now have to 
lay off for drift, which will give you a heading of 217 at the top, balanced by 17 
degrees of port drift, giving a track of 200.
2	
d.	
3	
b.	
We recommend that you use the CRP-5 for true altitude problems, especially if 
the question gives you the actual SAT instead of ISA deviation.  But if you want 
to use the formula, the ISA deviation is +30 degrees:
	
	
True Alt =  5000  +  (+30  ×  4/1000   ×   5000)  =  5600 feet
	
	
which is pretty close to answer (b).
4	
d.	
You would expect the greatest drift when the wind direction makes the greatest 
angle with from the track or reciprocal direction (the JAA use the word ‘course’ 
to mean ‘desired track’).   The reciprocal track of 040° is 220° and answer (d) is 
the furthest from 220°.
5	
b.	
6	
a.	
You should note that these longitudes are meridian and anti-meridian.  This is 
the over-the-pole case.
7	
a.	
If your compass heading is 090°(C), you can fill in the following table:
	
	
T	
  V	
 M	
 D.	
 C
	
	
100	
12E	
088	
2W	
090
	
	
So your true heading is 100.  VOR radials are always magnetic, so you are flying 
a true track of 082.  Your TAS is 160.  If you have gone 14 NM in 6 min, your G/S 
is 140.   Now use your CRP-5 as in Chapter 6.
8	
d.	
This question is solved by scale drawing.  Use the scale to draw a line 480 NM 
along the 110°E meridian from the North Pole, then plot a line 300 NM in a 
direction of 154°Grid.
9

c.	
74 NM @ the planned G/S of 115 knots	
=	
38.6 min
	
	
250 NM @ the planned G/S of 115 knots	
=	
130.4 min
	
	
After 74 NM, the actual elapsed time		
=	
40.1 min
	
	
Therefore the flight time for 250 NM at the revised G/S = 130.4  ×   40.1 / 38/6
This comes to 135 min.  0900UTC + 135 min = 1115UTC
18	
c.	
ETA B and ETA C are not relevant.  You fly 30 NM in 17 min.  How long will it 
take you to fly the remaining 20 NM at the same ground speed?
19	
a

c.	
Plotting question.  Solve by measurement on the chart.
21	
a.	
22	
d 	
Find the present TAS, apply the wind and get the present G/S (230 knots)
	
	
150 NM @ 230 kt G/S is 39 min. You need to arrive 5 minutes later, so your new 
time to go is 44 min.
	
	
The new required G/S will be 150 NM in 44 min, which is 205 kt G/S
	
	
The wind should not change, so the new required TAS will be 240
	
	
Then either use FL140/-5°(C) in the airspeed window to convert the TAS to 190 
kt CAS, or put the old TAS (264) against the old IAS (210), then against 240 
TAS, you will see 190.
	
	
210 to 190 is a 20 knot reduction in IAS (strictly CAS, but the PEC should not 
change much in 20 knots).
	
	
Answer (d). 
23	
c.	
ETA Y is irrelevant.  If it takes you 30 minutes to cover 30 NM, it will take you a 
further 20 minutes to cover the remaining 20 NM at the same ground speed.
24	
b 	
The QNH is 988 hPa.  The datum for Pressure Altitude is 1013 hPa, which is 25 
hPa greater.  Using 27 feet to one hPa, this equates to a distance of 675 feet.  A 
greater static pressure occurs at a lower pressure level.  Therefore the 1013 hPa 
pressure level is below sea level by 675 feet.  The airport is 1000 feet above sea 
level, which means that it is 1675 feet above the 1013 hPa pressure level.

b 	
The aircraft flies 2950 NM N, which takes it to 4500N 17822W.  Now convert 
314 km to NM and then use the departure formula.

The true bearing from you TO the headland is 050°(T).  However, you are going 
to have to plot FROM the headland to the aircraft (the headland is on your 
map – the aircraft’s position is not!)
	
	
The aircraft’s heading has been measured relative to the direction of True North 
at the aircraft’s position.  If there is significant chart convergence between the 
aircraft’s position and the headland’s position, the direction of True North will 
be different at the headland.  We must therefore plot the reciprocal bearing 
using the aircraft’s meridian paralleled through the headland’s position.

A 5% glide slope means that for every 100 knots you go forward horizontally, 
you go down 5 knots vertically. 5% of your forward speed of 150 is 7.5 knots 
vertically. Convert this to feet per min and you will see that option (a) is the 
nearest

65 NM @ 240 knots will take 16.25 minutes. I need to lose 25 000 feet, also in

The lowest latitude at which there is at least one day a year without a Sunset 
(Mid-summer Day) and one day a year without a Sunrise (Mid-winter Day) is 
the Arctic Circle (which is 66½°N).  Therefore the Sun will rise and set every day 
at 62N and 66N.  The higher of these two is 66N.

Look up the LMT of Sunrise at 49N on the 6th December.  There is 3 minutes 
change between the 4th Dec and the 7th Dec.  So, interpolating, the times 
at 50N and 45N are 0742 and 0723 respectively.  That is a difference of 19 
minutes.  One-fifth of that is about 4 minutes, so the LMT of Sunrise at 49N on 
the 6th December is 0738.  Now set it out in a table:

The first leg takes it down to the Equator at 170W, the second leg takes it to 
the Equator at 143W, the third leg takes it to 27N 143W and you then work 
out the change of longitude of 1620 NM due west departure at 27N, which is 
30°18’ W, i.e. 17318W.
	
	
However, you do not need to do the full calculation.  You should realize that a 
departure of 3000 km will give a greater change of longitude at 27N than it will 
at the Equator.  Therefore, the answer must be at 27N, but WEST of the 170W 
meridian.  There is only one option which fits.

You have 120 NM horizontal distance to travel at 288 knots.  This will take 25 
minutes.  You need to lose 24 000 feet in 25 minutes, which is 960 feet per 
minute.
61	
a 	
You need to lose 6500 feet at a rate of descent of 1000 feet per minute.  This 
will take 6.5 minutes.  Flying for this time at a ground speed of 156 knots gives 
a distance of 16.9 NM.  However, this is 6 NM before the DME, so the total 
distance to start the descent is 22.9 NM.
62	
c
63	
d.	
This is a 9-degree change of latitude.  You could work this out as 540 NM and 
then convert it to km, but there is a quicker way.  90 degrees of change of 
latitude is 10 000 km (see pages 28/29, so a 9 degree change of latitude will be 
1000 km.
64	
d.	
The thing to realize is that on a Mercator chart, meridians are drawn as parallel 
lines. Therefore the total length of the 53N parallel of latitude will be 133 cm as 
will be the length of the 30S parallel of latitude.
	
	
So now find the departure from 180E to 180W at 30S.
	
	
Dep = ch.long × cos 30
	
	
= 360 × 60 × cos 30 = 18 706 NM
	
	
You now have a simple scale problem. The Chart length is 133 cm, the Earth 
Distance is 18 706. This gives you a scale of approximately 1:26 million. 
65

The Sun would be at its Zenith.

b.	
Find the true heading in the normal way, then apply variation and deviation. 
First, check that you have balanced the drift.  When deviation is given as East 
or West then you use the DEVIATION EAST COMPASS LEAST RULE. However, 
deviation (not variation, only deviation) is sometimes quoted as plus or minus-. 
In this case the rule is that deviation is what you apply to the compass to get 
magnetic (not the other way round). So EAST deviation is plus and WEST 
deviation is minus.

3  × 444 is 1332 km.  Divide by 1.852 to get 719.2 NM.  This has obviously been

You should remember that the distance from the Equator to a Pole is 5400 NM 
(90° change of latitude × 60 NM per degree).  So the Earth’s circumference is

associated anti-meridian) by 60.
72

The rhumb line track from 70S to 70S is along a parallel of latitude, so it will 
be 090(T). However, the great circle track will ‘cut the corner’ and take the 
shortest route. This will be to the south of 090(T). Draw it out on a Lambert’s

As the air becomes less dense, the aircraft has to fly faster through it (TAS)

which means that the Mach No. would also increase even if there were no 
temperature change.
	
	
However, in addition, temperature normally decreases with increasing altitude. 
This means that the speed of sound will decrease so, for a given TAS, the Mach

360 NM       =   change of longitude (minutes)    ×    cosine 60 (which is 0.5)
	
	
Change of longitude = 720 minutes.

The only problem with this question is the language, not the concept.  The 
question is telling us that the polar diameter and the equatorial diameter of 
the Earth are in the ratio 296:297.  The ‘semi-major axis of the Earth, measured 
at the axis of the Equator’ is simply half the equatorial diameter and the ‘semi-
minor axis of the Earth measured at the axis of the Poles’ is half the Polar 
diameter.  We need to find half the Polar diameter, or the Polar radius.
	
	
Polar radius / 6378.4	 =	
296 / 297
	
	
So Polar radius		
=	
6356.9 km
	
	
Alternatively, you could remember from page 3 that the Polar diameter is 43 
km shorter than the equatorial diameter.  So the radius or semi-diameter will 
be 21.5 km shorter.  
	
	
6378.4 – 21.5	 =

ETA for top of descent.
	
	
From FL370 to FL80 is 29 000 feet.  At 1800 feet per minute, that is 16.1 minutes. 
Your mean ground speed in the descent is 232 knots so, for 16.1 min, that is 62

Your total distance to run is 185 NM.  If there are 62 NM is the descent, the high

The change in longitude between 040°E and 035°W is 75°.  The Earth rotates 
at 15° per hour, so this is equivalent to 5 hours of time.  The Earth rotates 
eastwards, so a westerly longitude will have a later UTC Sunrise time.

This is just the one in sixty rule.  The variation is 4° in error.  For each 60 NM 
between waypoints, the aircraft will be 4 NM off track.
	
	
Dist off		
=

×	
200 / 60 	
=	
13⅓ NM
161	
b.	
The JAA use the term ‘course’ to mean ‘desired track’.  If the drift is 8° starboard, 
the true heading is 292°(T).  With 10°W variation, this is 302°(M).  Negative 
deviation must be applied to the compass to give magnetic heading, so the 
compass heading is 306°(M).  In other words, -4° deviation is the same as 4°W.
162	
a.	
If the compass heading is 195C, apply -2 degrees deviation to get 193 Mag 
heading. 
	
	
If you have a True Track of 180 and 8 degrees starboard drift, the true heading 
must be 172(T).
	
	
With a heading of 172(T) and 195(M), you have 21 degrees West variation.
163	
b 	
Apply 8°W variation to 060°(M) to get 052°(T).  With 4° starboard drift, the 
true track is 056°(T).

192°(T)	+     7E Var	
=	
185°(M)ag Track.  With 5° of left drift, you need 
to aim off 5°(T)o the right, onto a Mag heading of 190°(M).
171	
d.	
The datum meridian is Greenwich, so the aircraft is 115° West of the datum in 
the Northern hemisphere.  Therefore convergence is 115°E.  Convergence East 
– True Least.  So True track will be 115 degrees less than Grid Track.  344°(G) – 
115°(C)onvergence = 229°(T).

Do not forget that ISA at FL410 is still -56.5°(C), even though you are higher 
than 36 090 feet pressure alt.  So the SAT is -46.5°(C).   Use the CRP-5.
174	
b.	
Convert 22 US.gal per hour to imperial gallons on the CRP-5.  The answer is 
about 18.3 imp.gal/hour.  Then use either the CRP-5 or your calculator to get 
the total endurance.
175	
b.	
A and B are at the same latitude but different longitudes.  So it is a departure 
problem.
	
	
Departure	
=	
change of longitude (in minutes)      ×	     cosine latitude
	
	
Departure	
=	
1     ×	     60	
   ×	
cos 60	 	
=	
30 NM
	
	
A and C are at different latitudes but the same longitude.  So it is a simple 
change of latitude problem.  One degree is 60 NM.

You need 4° right to correct for track error angle and parallel track. Then, with 
60 NM gone, there are 30 NM to go.  Four NM off in 30 gives a closing angle of 
8°.  Total change = 12° right.

To calculate the TAS for the descent you need to have the mean altitude 
and mean temperature with the IAS. Mean altitude is 21 500 ft and mean 
temperature is -30°C.
186	
b	
For a climb the TAS is calculated using the 2/3 change in altitude and 
temperature.  2/3 altitude is  21 000 ft and temperature is -20°C so the TAS is 
242 kt.  GS is 272 kt and the time is 23.3 min
187	
d	
ISA Dev = +25°C, Temperature Correction = 4 ft × 20 × +25 = 2000 ft.  TA = IA + 
Temp Corr = 19 300 + 2000 = 21 300 ft
