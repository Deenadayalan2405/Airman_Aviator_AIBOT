Characteristics and General Definitions
Introduction
Pilots receive information about the state of their aircraft and its speed, altitude, position 
and attitude through instruments and displays.  These can vary from the simplest of dials and 
pointers to modern electronic displays (the so-called ‘glass cockpits’), depending on the vintage 
and the complexity of the aircraft, and a simple dial can seem very different in appearance 
and sophistication from a modern cathode ray tube or liquid crystal screen.  However, certain 
problems of range, resolution, accuracy and reliability are general characteristics of all 
instrumentation systems.
Measuring Range Versus Accuracy
It is often necessary to show a large operating range, yet still indicate with accuracy over the 
whole range.  For instance, an airliner might be limited to a maximum permitted airspeed 
of 350 knots, so perhaps the instrument would be designed to display up to, say, 380 or 400 
knots.  However, certain speeds are critical to flight safety and need to be read with extreme 
accuracy – ideally to the nearest knot.  If we put the whole range on a single revolution of 
the instrument the division representing one knot will very small and will be difficult to read 
accurately.
Circular Scale (Linear)
A simple indicator showing the change of value of the parameter to be measured over a range 
of 0 to 30 units is shown in Figure 1.1 (Linear).  The accuracy with which these values need to 
be measured will govern the spacing of the graduation.  
Circular Scale (Non-linear)
Some instruments are required to show changes of parameters more accurately at certain 
parts of the scale.  The example in Figure 1.2 (Non-linear) shows a rate of climb indicator where 
low rates of climb/descent are more easily read than high rates.  This is a logarithmic scale.

Characteristics and General Definitions
High Range Long Scale Displays
Where the  instrument  needs  to  show changes over a high 
range of values and these changes need to be read with a fair 
degree of accuracy, 360° of movement of the  pointer  may  not 
be  sufficient. The pointer may make more than one revolution 
to cover the required range, as on the airspeed indicator 
shown in Figure 1.3, though this type of display may lead to 
some confusion.
Figure 1.3  indicates an airspeed of 300 kt.
Another solution is to have a pointer moving over a fixed scale 
(tens of  knots) with a moving scale indicating larger units 
(hundreds of knots).
Figure 1.4: The small pointer and dial, inset in the top of the 
instrument, indicates 100s. The long pointer and main dial 
indicates 10s.
This indicator shows an airspeed of 33 kt.
A less confusing display uses two concentric pointers moving 
over two separate scales, as  shown  on  the revolution counter.
Figure 1.5: The small needle, and inner scale, reads 10s of units. 
The large needle, and outer scale, reads units.
This indicator shows 25½ % rpm for a turbine engine.

A further solution, shown in Figure 1.6, is to display information 
in a similar  fashion  to  a  clock,  with pointers showing  hours, 
minutes and seconds.  This system is used on many altimeters. 
The long pointer will cover 1000 feet in one revolution, so each 
division of the scale represents 100 feet.  The  middle pointer 
will cover 10 000 feet per revolution, each  division marking 
1000 feet and the smallest pointer will cover 100 000 feet, each 
division representing 10 000 feet.
Figure 1.6 indicates a height of 25 950 ft.
	
    
Ergonomy
Ergonomy (also known as human engineering) is the science of relationships between people 
and machines.  An ergonomic device interacts smoothly with peoples’ bodies and actions.  In 
an aviation context this can mean designing the shape and position of controls, levers and 
knobs so that they are easily controlled and unlikely to lead to an incorrect selection.  For 
instruments or instrument systems it means designing instruments that are unlikely to be 
misread and locating them in a layout that facilitates easy and correct interpretation of the 
information displayed.  Standard layouts came to be adopted.
Location
The ‘flying’ instruments which covered the handling of the aircraft were arranged in the layout 
of the ‘basic six’. Other instruments tended to be scattered around the cockpit in positions 
most convenient to the designer and manufacturer, seldom to suit the needs of the pilot.

Presentations can be in analogue or digital form.  Analogue is, typically, a pointer on a dial 
whereas digital is a row of numbers.  Look at the 2 types of altimeter display at Figure 1.10 and

With the 3-pointer analogue system, the altitude information (24 020 feet) is harder to absorb 
at a single glance than with the digital display.  The digital numbers are much easier to read. 
However, we note that one pointer still remains in the design of the mainly-digital presentation. 
This is because the human eye and brain cannot easily interpret rate information from moving 
numbers. Whilst the altimeter is primarily designed to show altitude, with a separate instrument 
(the vertical speed indicator) to show rate of change of altitude, pilots pick up a lot of secondary 
information about vertical rate from the angular rate of the altimeter pointer. 
Electronic Displays
Historically, instruments have been located on instrument panels, though this is now changing 
with modern electronic displays.  Compare the traditional layout (Figure 1.12) with the modern 
electronic (glass) layout in Figure 1.13 & Figure 1.14 below.

With modern electronic systems, although the displays have to be on the flight deck where the 
crew can see and operate them, the computing units and power units are located remotely in 
some other part of the aircraft, usually in a separate compartment called the Avionics Bay or 
the Electrics and Electronics (E&E) Bay.

Readability
A readable instrument should be designed with an eye reference point in mind.  This is the 
anticipated position that the pilot’s eye will occupy when viewing the instrument under normal 
conditions.  If the instrument has a design where there is a reference mark or index with a scale 
behind it, it is important that the eye, the index and the scale are all in line.  Otherwise, there 
is an error known as parallax, which is simply caused by viewing the instrument from slightly to 
one side instead of from the front.

Pitot and Static Sources
Introduction
An aircraft at rest on the ground in still air is subject to normal atmospheric pressure, which 
bears equally on all parts of the aircraft.  This ambient pressure is known as static pressure. 
An aircraft in flight, whilst still subject to the static pressure at its flight level, experiences 
an additional pressure on the leading edges due to the resistance of the air to the aircraft’s 
movement.
This additional pressure is dynamic pressure, and its value depends on the speed of the aircraft 
through the air and on the density of the air.  The leading edges, therefore, encounter a total 
pressure consisting of static plus dynamic pressures.  This total pressure is also known as pitot 
pressure.
It is not possible to isolate dynamic pressure by direct measurement because it cannot be 
separated from the associated static pressure.  The instruments which require dynamic pressure 
therefore measure total (pitot) pressure and also static pressure and then subtract static from 
pitot within the instrument to derive dynamic pressure.

Airspeed Indicator (ASI)
Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI) 
Machmeter
Inside an aircraft, pressure and temperature are seldom the same as outside the aircraft so 
pitot and static pressures must be sensed by devices mounted on the outside of the aircraft.
Pitot/Static Heads
An open-ended tube parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is used to sense the total 
pressure (static plus dynamic).  This device is a ‘pitot tube’ mounted in a ‘pitot head’.
The open end of the tube faces into the moving airstream, the other end leading to the airspeed 
capsules in the ASI and Machmeter.
The moving airstream is thus brought to rest in the tube, so generating the extra (dynamic) 
pressure which together with the static pressure already in the tube provides the required total 
(pitot) pressure.

Pitot and Static Sources
Figure 2.1 
A ‘static head’ consists of a tube with its 
forward end sealed but with holes or slots cut 
in the sides. These slots do not face into the 
airflow and therefore, in theory, they sense 
only the static pressure. In fact, of course, 
there will be a suction effect and the sensed 
static pressure will be slightly lower when the 
aircraft is moving.  This pressure supplies the 
static ‘line’ to the pressure instruments.  A 
pressure sensing system consisting of separate 
pitot and static heads is shown in Figure 2.1.
The static and pitot sources may be combined 
in one ‘pressure head’, the static tube 
surrounding the pitot tube, with separate 
pressure lines leading to the pressure instruments.  Figure 2.2 illustrates an example of this 
type. 
Requirements of a Pitot Tube
The pitot tube must be positioned outside the boundary layer, so it usually consists of a head 
on a strut if mounted on the side of the fuselage, or it can be a tube placed on the nose, ahead 
of the fuselage.  The opening must be designed to be parallel to the airflow in the normal 
flight attitude.
The air can either be brought to rest in the pitot probe against a stagnation wall, which is 
simply a pressure-measuring flat surface, and then transmitted up the pitot pipelines to the 
ASI and Machmeter.  Alternatively, the pitot pressure can be passed directly up into the pitot 
pipelines to the instruments, which is more usual in elementary aircraft.
Measurement of dynamic pressure is essential to safe flight.  At too low a speed, the aircraft 
will stall.  At too high a speed it will be overstressed.  The ASI is critical to flight safety and 
so it cannot be allowed to block because of ice.  An electric anti-icing heater coil is usually 
incorporated.  Any errors due to the heating effect may be reduced by design and calibration. 
However, if water is drained, ice should not be able to form.  Drain holes are therefore 
provided.  These will, of course, cause some loss of pressure, but this can be suitably calibrated 
and allowed for in the design.

Pitot and Static Sources
Requirements of a Static Source
The static source, whether a simple hole or a combined probe, should have its opening at right 
angles to the airflow, so that only static pressure is sensed, with no component of dynamic 
pressure.  Some static sensors, especially those in the combined pitot/static probe may be 
fitted with electric heating.
Figure 2.2 A combined pitot/static pressure head
Figure 2.3 How turbulence affects the value of static 
pressure
Position Error
As previously stated, if the aircraft has forward motion, the static pressure sensed will be slightly 
lower than if the aircraft is stationary, due to suction. As the speed increases, due to turbulent 
airflow in the region of the pitot/static heads, this error becomes greater.  Turbulence will also 
affect the pitot reading.  The error involved is called Position Error (or alternatively ‘pressure’ 
error).  At large angles of attack (which are usually associated with lower airspeeds) the 
pressure head is inclined at an angle to the airstream so that position error is usually greater. 
Flight manuals may list different values of position error for different flap settings.
Position error depends mainly on the positioning of the pressure head, the airspeed, and the 
aircraft attitude.  Turbulence produced in the airstream by the pressure head itself affects 
the value of static pressure sensed rather than the pitot pressure because the turbulence is 
downstream of the pitot opening.  This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 2.3.
Figure 2.4 A static vent
Because of this, the Static Vent, was introduced 
as a source of static pressure instead of  the 
static  head, pitot pressure then being sensed 
by a simple pitot head.  A static vent separated 
from the pitot head is shown in Figure 2.4.
There is usually some place on the airframe, 
usually on the side of the fuselage, where true 
(or nearly true) static pressure is obtained 
over the whole speed range of the aircraft.  A 
flat metal plate is fitted at this position, the
--- Page 22 ---

Pitot and Static Sources
static line from the pressure instruments terminating at a small circular hole - the static vent 
- in this plate.  A similar vent is positioned on the opposite side of the fuselage and the two 
are interconnected for transmission  of  static  pressure  to  the instruments  so  that  errors 
produced  by yawing are largely eliminated.
Advantages of the Static Vent
•	 The airflow in the region of the vents is less turbulent and the static pressure measured is 
more accurate.
•	 Errors produced when side-slipping or yawing are reduced.
•	 Duplication of static vents either side of the fuselage reduces errors due to side-slip or yawing 
(cross balancing of static vents).
High Speed Probes
The shock waves associated with flight at high 
mach numbers can produce significant errors 
in pressure sensed by a static vent.  Modern 
high speed aircraft may accordingly be fitted 
with a more sophisticated combined pitot/
static pressure head in order to keep position 
error within acceptable limits. The choice of 
location for a probe, or vent, is dependent 
upon the aerodynamics of the aircraft. Typical 
locations are: ahead of a wing tip, under a 
wing, ahead of the vertical stabilizer tip, at the side of the fuselage nose section, and ahead of 
the fuselage nose section.
Manoeuvre-induced Error
Manoeuvre-induced errors are caused by short-term fluctuations of pressure at the static vents 
and delays in the associated pipelines transmitting pressure changes to the instruments.
Even servo altimeters and air data computer systems suffer from this type of error as they 
utilize the same static vents as the simple pressure instruments.  Change in angle of attack, 
and turbulence due to lowering (or raising ) flaps and landing gear are the prime causes of the 
error-producing changes in airflow over the static vents.
Most commonly, manoeuvre-induced error appears as a marked lag in pressure instrument 
indications.
The errors are usually more significant during changes of pitch attitude than during yawing 
or rolling movements so that the worst effects are at the start of the climb or descent and on 
levelling out.
Overshooting (referred to as go-around) and flight in rough air are particularly vulnerable.
The errors are unpredictable both in size and in sense so that pressure instruments cannot be 
relied upon to indicate accurate instantaneous values or accurate rates of change.

This particularly applies to vertical speed indicators.  In-flight manoeuvres should therefore 
be carried out using gyroscopic instruments as the primary reference.  A manoeuvre-induced 
error may be present for some time after movement of the control surfaces has ceased, values 
of three seconds at low altitude increasing to 10 seconds at 30 000 feet (longer for VSIs) being 
quite common.
Full Pitot/Static System
The transmission from the probes to the instruments usually takes the form of pipelines in 
elementary and older systems, but in modern aircraft it is usually carried by electrical wires. 
Both pitot and static pipelines will have in-built water traps.  Modern systems often have 
electronic pressure transducers at the pitot and static sources with built-in error correction. 
The measurement is analogue but analogue/digital interface units (A/D IFUs) convert it into 
digital form for onward use.  This may be to stand-alone pressure instruments but, more usually 
in modern aircraft, it is to a device known as the air data computer.  If it is in digital form, data 
digital buses may be used for transmission instead of wires.
Pitot systems are not usually cross-coupled.  The left pitot source goes to the left pitot instruments 
and the right pitot source goes to the right pitot instruments.  Modern flight instrumentation 
systems may compare the outputs and give a warning in the event of a discrepancy in excess 
of, say, 5 knots, but they do not cross-feed pitot pressure.
Static systems, however, are almost invariably cross-coupled.  Both the left and the right static 
system will have its own static vent on each side of the fuselage.  Each static system will take 
an input from its own left and right static vents and the mixed static pressure for that system 
will pass up to the static instruments for that side.  Large aircraft will also have a standby pair 
of static vents (left and right) for the standby ASI and altimeter.  (It is not normal to have a 
standby VSI or Machmeter).  Cross-coupling the left and right vents on these systems reduces 
error caused by yawing and side-slipping.

Pitot and Static Sources
For light aircraft, an alternate static source is normally provided in the event of the static head/
vents becoming blocked.  The selector switch will be in the cabin.
The alternate static source may be to the outside of the aircraft or from inside the cabin (in 
unpressurized aircraft only).
The alternate static pressure will be less accurate than the primary (blocked) static vent/head, 
since that would have been in the optimum position.   The alternate static pressure sensed is 
likely to be lower than ambient due to aerodynamic suction.  This is generally true whether 
the alternate source is external or from within an unpressurized cabin.  Instruments using static 
are calibrated to take account of the pressure (position) error at their normal supply so, when 
alternate (standby) pressure systems are used, correction values for the instruments concerned 
may be found in the Operating Data Manual for the aircraft.
Pitot Covers and Static Vent Plugs
Pitot and static openings are highly sensitive.  Any dirt, dust and sand in them can distort their 
measurements, often drastically.  Also, as they tend to be warmer at night than the rest of the 
aircraft, insects can be attracted to them as resting places.  It is therefore necessary to cover 
them when the aircraft is not in use.
Pitot covers are canvas or rubber closed tubes which fit over the outside of the pitot probe. 
Static plugs are usually made of rubber and are shaped like small corks.  It is clearly essential 
that they not are left in place in flight, therefore removing them is included in the preflight 
external checks.  They normally have a very conspicuous streamer or ribbon up to a metre long 
attached to them to ensure that they are not overlooked.
Pitot and Static Heaters
All aircraft have pitot heaters and, on combined pitot/static probes, the static opening will 
consequentially receive some heating. Modern systems have an alert warning if the heaters 
are not switched on in flight.
It is essential to test the operation of the pitot heater prior to flight.  This can be done by 
switching it on for about 30 seconds and carefully feeling the pitot probe to check that it has 
got warm.  On other aircraft it may be possible to check that on switching on there is a rise in 
the ammeter current, or that the magnetic compass is deflected. It should then be switched 
off again so that it does not burn out.  Make sure that the pitot covers and static plugs are 
removed before turning the heaters on to check them or you may burn or melt them!
It is normally part of the pre-take-off checks to ensure that heaters are switched on again and 
part of the after-landing checks to switch them off.
Preflight Checks of the Pitot/Static System.
•	 All covers and plugs removed and stowed. 
•	 All tubes, holes, slots free of obstructions.
•	 Pitot head heater operating.

Air Temperature Measurement
Introduction
Why does a pilot need to know the temperature of the air in which he is flying?  There are 
several reasons:
•	 Avoidance of icing conditions
•	 Because temperature affects air density, which, in turn, affects:
•	 Engine power and aircraft performance
•	 Measurement of speed
•	 Measurement of altitude
Avoidance of Icing Conditions
The formation of ice on aircraft, particularly in cloud, can be very rapid.  Icing can be very 
dangerous, because the following can occur:
•	 Loss of lift (ice will distort the aerofoil shape)
•	 Increase in drag (ice will distort the aerofoil shape)
•	 Increase in mass (can be as much as ten tons with thick icing on large aircraft)
•	 Freezing of control surfaces so that they cannot be moved
•	 Loss of engine power or total engine failure due to intake or carburettor icing
•	 Chunks of ice flying off the propellors and hitting the side of the fuselage
Many forms of weather are unpleasant or uncomfortable (turbulence, lightning, etc) but ice 
is particularly dangerous.  There are two ways to minimize the risk.  One is to avoid flying in 
cloud.  The other is to climb or descend in order to avoid the temperature bands particularly 
associated with icing.  These will vary from aircraft type to aircraft type but will be known for 
each particular type.
Engine Power and Aircraft Performance
To see why air temperature affects engine power, consider how any aviation engine (jet or 
piston) works.  Air is drawn in through the intake and mixed with vapourized fuel which is burnt 
in a cylinder or a combustion chamber where its volume is greatly expanded.  This expansion is 
partly caused by the addition of combustion products (i.e. fuel), but mainly caused by a large 
temperature rise.  In order to achieve correct combustion, the fuel/air ratio has to be carefully 
controlled.  If the air is dense, more fuel will be provided and more power will be available. 
However, if the air is less dense, less fuel will be provided, in order to maintain the correct mix. 
Therefore less power will be produced.  This can have a considerable effect, particularly on 
take-off performance.  Pilots therefore need to be able to measure air temperature in order to 
calculate engine power and performance.
Measurement of Speed
We cannot measure airspeed directly, so we measure air pressure.  However, pressure is 
dependent on both relative speed and air density.  Air temperature affects air density and 
therefore affects the calculation of airspeed.
Measurement of Altitude
The rate of pressure change with altitude varies with temperature.  Altimeter indication can be 
in error unless corrected for temperature differences from normal.  This can have serious safety 
implications when flying near high ground in cloud.

Air Temperature Thermometers
Air temperature thermometers can be divided into 2 basic types: Direct Reading or Remote 
Reading.
Direct Reading.  These work on the principle of differential coefficients of expansion with 
temperature.  Invar is a nickel steel alloy notable for its uniquely low coefficient of thermal 
expansion.  A bimetallic strip is constructed consisting of invar and brass bonded together as 
shown in Figure 3.1.
When this strip is heated, the brass, having a higher coefficient of expansion than the invar, will 
expand more than the invar so that the strip curls as shown.  How much the strip curls depends 
on the temperature rise to which the strip is subjected.
Figure 3.1 A bimetallic strip
The strip is drawn out into a helix, to give greater pointer movement for a given temperature 
rise, and is incorporated into an instrument with a dial as shown in Figure 3.2.

The thermometer is mounted on the windscreen or fuselage with the tube protruding out into 
the air stream and the dial visible to the pilot, as shown in Figure 3.3.
Figure 3.3 Thermometer placement on a PA28 Warrior
Remote Reading.  However, the direct reading thermometer is not a workable solution for a 
larger aircraft.  Firstly, a device that penetrates the windscreens would weaken the structure 
to an unacceptable extent at the pressures associated with higher speeds.  Secondly, it is 
desirable to have the temperature information in an electrical form so that it can be fed to 
other instruments and systems.

Air Temperature Measurement
Total Air Temperature Probe
Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5 show typical air temperature probes.
The probe is in the form of 
a small strut and air intake 
made 
of 
nickel-plated 
beryllium 
copper, 
which 
provides 
good 
thermal 
conductivity and strength. 
It is fixed to the fuselage at 
a point which keeps it away 
from the aircraft’s boundary 
layer.
As the air flows through the 
tube, separation of water 
particles 
is 
achieved 
by 
causing the airflow to turn 
through a right angle before 
passing round the sensing 
element.
The  bleed holes in the intake 
casing permit boundary air to 
be drawn off because of the higher pressure inside  the intake.
A resistance wire made of pure platinum is 
used as the sensor.  It has a very high thermal 
conductivity and a rapid response to change.
An inbuilt heating element prevents the 
formation of ice.  It is self-compensating – 
as the temperature rises, so does the heater 
resistance, reducing the heater current.
The heater can have a small effect on 
the temperature readings.  However, this 
introduces an error of less than 1°C, which is 
not significant.
It is also necessary to measure air temperature 
on the ground.  Modern aircraft do not use 
full power for take-off in order to avoid 
unnecessary thermal stress to the engines.  The take-off is carried out using the minimum power 
necessary to ensure safety, but no more.  Runway length, weight, altitude and temperature are 
taken into consideration in the calculation of the required power and it is perfectly normal to 
carry out a take-off at, say, 93% power.

Air Temperature Measurement
In order to measure air temperature on the ground an air to air ejector (aspirator) is used, 
as shown in Figure 3.6.  Bleed air from either an APU or a running engine creates a negative 
differential pressure within the casing so that outside air is drawn through it even when the 
aircraft is stationary in order to prevent the temperature of stagnant, heat-soaked air from 
within the casing being measured.
Figure 3.6 Aspirated TAT probe - suction effect from positive compressor air 
pressure
In the above diagram, the engine bleed air is positive pressure from one of the engine 
compressor stages.  Although it is blowing, not sucking, the flow is arranged such that the 
rearward movement of the engine bleed air creates a suction effect past the sensing element.
Errors
Air temperature gauges are subject to the following errors:
•	 Instrument error 	
	
-	
imperfections in manufacture
•	 Environmental errors 	
- 	
solar heating of the probe
	
	
	
	
	
(overcome by shielding in the strut)
	
	
	
	
	
Ice accretion on the probe
	
	
	
	
	
(overcome by use of the heater)
•	 Heating error	
	
-	
adiabatic (compression) and kinetic (friction) heating
Of these, by far the greatest is heating error – the effects of compression and kinetic heat.

Air Temperature Measurement
Heating Error – The Effects of Compression and Kinetic Heat
Figure 3.7 The effect of speed on measured temperature
As aircraft speed increases, the measured temperature exceeds that of the still air.  This is 
caused by a combination of kinetic (friction) and adiabatic (compression) heating.
•	 Kinetic heating.  Kinetic heating is a contributor to the temperature rise effect in the Direct 
Reading thermometer.  As the speed increases, more and more molecules of air per second 
impact against the flat plate at the surfaces of the probe.  This causes a temperature rise 
due to friction.
•	 Adiabatic heating.  Adiabatic heating is the main contributor to the temperature rise effect 
in the Remote Reading (or Total Head) thermometer.  It is caused by a conversion of energy, 
not a direct application of heat.  For example, boiling a kettle is a direct application of heat, 
whereas pumping a bicycle pump causes a rise in temperature without any input of heat 
because pressure energy is converted into temperature energy.  In the Remote Reading 
temperature probe, the outside airflow which may be several hundred knots is brought 
virtually to rest in the platinum measurement chamber very rapidly.  The energy of the 
moving air is released in the form of a temperature rise.
There is a known relationship between the relative speed and the temperature rise.  The laws 
of thermodynamics are such that the combination of kinetic and adiabatic heating will always 
add up to a figure known as the Total Ram Rise.  
Unfortunately, any measurement process always has leaks and inefficiencies, so we do not 
measure the full ram rise.  The amount of ram rise actually sensed is called the Measured Ram 
Rise.  If we could measure the Total Ram Rise, we would measure the Total Air Temperature.
However, in practice, what we measure is the Ram Air Temperature, which is lower.
•	 Static Air Temperature (SAT).  Sometimes written as TS.  SAT is the temperature of the 
undisturbed air through which the aircraft is about to fly.
--- Page 37 ---

Air Temperature Measurement
•	 Total Air Temperature (TAT).  Sometimes written as Tt.  TAT is the maximum temperature 
attainable by the air when brought to rest adiabatically.  
•	 Ram Air Temperature (RAT).  The RAT is the measured air temperature.
•	 Ram Rise.  Ram rise is the difference between the SAT and the TAT (Total Ram Rise) or the 
difference between the SAT and the RAT (Measured Ram Rise).
•	 Recovery Factor.  The percentage of the Ram Rise sensed and recovered by a TAT probe is 
called the Recovery Factor (usual symbol is Kr).
Ram Rise – Application of Recovery Factor
Assume an aircraft experiencing a SAT of -60­°C at a speed where the (theoretical) Total Ram 
Rise would be 30°C.  Assume a Recovery Factor of 0.9.
SAT	
	
	
	
	
	
=	
-60°C
Total Ram Rise		
	
	
	
=	
+30°C
(Theoretical) Total Air Temperature 	 	
=	
-30°C
Recovery Factor	
	
	
	
= 	
0.9
Measured Ram Rise 	
(+30 × 0.9)	
	
=	
+27°C
Ram Air Temperature	 	
	
	
=	
-33°C
The gauges would actually indicate the Ram Air Temperature of -33°C.  A correction factor of 
-27°C would be applied by one of several methods to give SAT.
Theoretically, uncorrected air temperature gauges give RAT, not TAT.  However, in many 
aircraft, the gauges are incorrectly labelled ‘TAT’.
SAT is sometimes called COAT (Corrected Outside Air Temperature)  
TAT is sometimes called IOAT (Indicated Outside Air Temperature)
OAT on its own is usually taken to mean SAT.

Correction of TAT/RAT to SAT
The indicated RAT can be converted to SAT by the following methods:
•	 Rapid formula for use in the air
•	 CRP5 or similar navigation computer
•	 Accurate formula
•	 Data Tables
•	 Air Data Computer
Rapid Formula for Use in the Air
This formula is a good simple approximation:
(
)
2
Ram Rise =
v
100
where v = TAS in knots.
So, if TAS is 200 knots the ram rise is 4°C, if TAS is 300 knots the ram rise is 9°C, if TAS is 400 
knots the ram rise is 16°C, and so on.
This formula should not be used in JAA exams because it is not quite as accurate as the CRP5 
solution, but it is good enough for practical use in the air when a quick solution is required and 
it is not convenient to find a Nav Computer or look up tables.
Navigation Computer
On the slide rule face of the navigation computer there is a blue scale
The outer side is TAS and the inner is Ram Rise.  In the above example a TAS of 400 knots gives 
a Ram Rise of 17°C.

Air Temperature Measurement
Accurate Formula
The accurate formula is:     SAT = 
TAT
1 + 0.2 KrM²
where M = Mach Number
However, the formula assumes that temperature is quoted in degrees Absolute (°A), or Kelvin 
(K).
The Absolute, or Kelvin, Temperature Scale
When Celsius designed his temperature scale, he chose the boiling point of water as 100°C and 
the freezing point of water as 0°C.  This seemed reasonable, given the state of physics at the 
time.  However, the problem with the normal Celsius temperature scale is that it changes sign 
at 0°C (the freezing point of water).  Numbers above zero are positive whilst numbers below 
are negative.  But to measure the relative levels of hotness in objects in a meaningful way, we 
should start from a baseline of absolute zero – no heat at all.
This occurs at -273°C on the Celsius scale.  So -273°C is 0°A or 0 K on the kelvin scale.  One kelvin, 
or one degree Absolute, is the same amount of temperature change as one degree Celsius. 
Therefore the freezing point of water occurs at 273 K, the boiling point of water at 373 K, and 
so on.
Assume the following:
Indicated TAT (actually RAT)	 =	
-20°C
Mach No 	
	
=	
M 0.73 (typical cruise speed for a B737 in Long Range Cruise)
Recovery Factor	
=	
0.98 (which is a typical value for a modern TAT probe)
Kr is determined by flight testing and is published in the operating instructions for the aircraft.
A TAT of -20°C is 253 K.  Substituting into our formula:
SAT	
= 
TAT
1 + 0.2 KrM²
SAT	
= 
253
1 + (0.2 ×  0.98 × 0.73²)
SAT	
=	
253/ (1 + 0.1044)
SAT	
=	
253/ 1.1044	
= 229 K
229 K is -44°C on the Celsius scale.

Calibration
As a result of the variable changes in the atmosphere, due to temperature and pressure, it is 
necessary to have a standard calibration for the instruments.
The conditions used for calibration are usually those assumed for the:
International Standard Atmosphere
ISA

Air Temperature Measurement
Figure 3.10 The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
The relevant assumptions are:
At Mean Sea Level
Pressure 1013.25 hectopascals 	
Temperature +15°C 	
Density 1225 g/m3
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
From MSL up to 11 km (36 090 feet)
Temperature falling at 6.5°C per km (1.98°C/1000 feet)
From 11 km to 20 km (65 617 feet)
A constant temperature of - 56.5°C
From 20 km to 32 km (104 987 feet)
Temperature rising at 1°C per km (0.3°/1000 feet)
With these assumptions, the pressure corresponding to any given level in the ISA can be 
calculated from the calibration formulae.   
Graphs or tables can be produced showing height in terms of pressure under standard 
conditions.  These tables can be used for the manufacturer’s calibration of the altimeter scale. 
Any discrepancies, if within certain agreed tolerances, would be listed over the operating height 
ranges as  instrument errors.  (The calibration is carried out with increasing and decreasing 
readings so that the amount of lag at calibration conditions can be determined).

The Airspeed Indicator (ASI)
Principle of Operation
An aircraft on the ground in still air is subject only to atmospheric (static) pressure (S).  However, 
in flight, the leading edges of an aircraft are subject to an additional (dynamic) pressure.  This 
results in a total (pitot) pressure (P) on the leading edges of dynamic pressure plus static 
pressure.
Pitot  =  Dynamic  +  Static
The pitot head senses pitot pressure and the static/vent senses static pressure.  These two 
pressures are fed to the airspeed indicator, a differential pressure gauge, which measures their 
difference (the dynamic pressure). Dynamic pressure is related to airspeed, because:-
Dynamic Pressure  =    ½  ρV²
where V is true airspeed (TAS) and  ρ  is the density of the surrounding air.
The ASI measures airspeed by measuring dynamic pressure, displaying the result (usually in 
knots) on a suitably calibrated scale. (1 knot is 1 nautical mile per hour).
Construction
It is therefore necessary to construct a device in which static pressure is subtracted from pitot 
(total) pressure in order to isolate dynamic pressure.  Dynamic pressure cannot be directly 
measured; it must be established from the difference between pitot and static pressure.
Static pressure is fed into a hermetically-sealed instrument case, the pitot pressure being 
piped to a thin metal capsule capable of expansion and contraction.  The layout is shown in 
Figure 4.1.
Static pressure is present on both the inside 
and the outside of the metal walls of the 
capsule and so cancels.  Therefore the pressure 
differential between the inside and outside of 
the capsule is (Dy + S) - S which is Dynamic. 
Expansion or contraction on the capsule will 
therefore be proportional to the changes in 
dynamic pressure produced by changes of 
airspeed.
The capsule movements are transmitted by 
a 
temperature-compensated 
magnifying 
linkage to the pointer indicating airspeed on 
the face of the ASI.

The Airspeed Indicator (ASI)
Calibration
Dynamic pressure depends not only on the speed of the aircraft but also on the air density.
This density varies with temperature and pressure and therefore with altitude.  The ASI is 
calibrated to read true airspeed for the air density of 1225 grams per cubic metre which 
would be produced by the ISA MSL pressure of 1013.25 hPa and temperature + 15°C (dry air 
conditions). No allowance is made in the calibration for the change in density which occurs 
with change of altitude.
As the ASI is only calibrated at MSL, and ISA conditions, flight at any other height will cause 
errors.
ASI Definitions and Errors
Instrument Error.  Manufacturing imperfections and usage result in small errors which are 
determined on the ground under laboratory conditions by reference to a datum instrument.
A correction card can be produced for the speed range of the instrument.
Position Error.  Alternatively known as ‘pressure’ error, this arises mainly from the sensing of 
incorrect static pressure, and is described more fully in the section entitled Pressure Heads.
Position errors throughout the speed range are determined by the aircraft manufacturer during 
the test flying programme for a particular aircraft type.
It is not unusual to compile a joint correction card for position and instrument errors and place 
it in the aircraft near the ASI concerned.
Manoeuvre-induced Errors.  These are associated chiefly with manoeuvres involving change in 
angle of attack, giving transient errors and a lag in the indication of changes in airspeed.
Calibrated Airspeed (CAS)
The pilot corrects the IAS for Instrument and Position Error from the correction card to give 
Calibrated Airspeed (CAS).  For instance, for a combined correction of +2, if the pilot wants a 
speed of 100 knots CAS, he flies at 98 knots IAS.  Calibrated Airspeed is also known in some 
older publications (and on the Pooley CRP-5 Navigation Computer) as Rectified Airspeed (RAS). 
However, this term is no longer in general use.
CAS is IAS corrected for Instrument and Position (Pressure) Error.
Aircraft stress and stall limits are determined by dynamic pressure, not speed.  There are quoted 
limiting ‘speeds’ to avoid overstress or control problems with the aircraft as a whole, and also 
to avoid overstress of various services such as flaps and undercarriage.  In addition, there are 
also stall ‘speeds’ for various configurations.  These are functions of dynamic pressure.  As 
pressures, they could be quoted in bars, psi or pascals.  They are not speeds.  However, because 
the ASI is calibrated in ‘knots’ (even though this is only a true speed for a specific air density), 
dynamic pressure is measured in knots of CAS.  CAS will be equally valid as a measure of stall or 
stress limits whatever the aircraft’s true airspeed or altitude and whatever the air density.  The 
display of simple ASIs is therefore IAS and that of Air Data Computers is IAS or, in those with 
a computed correction for Instrument and Pressure Error, it is CAS.  This is in order to allow

pilots to be able to fly their aircraft safely without overstressing or stalling them.  (Air Data 
Computers calculate and indicate speed, altitude, temperature and other air parameters).
For navigation, and flight planning, the CAS is of no significant use. What the pilot requires 
is the speed of the aircraft relative to the ground. In the absence of any wind (this effect is 
discussed in General Navigation - book 10) this speed, relative to the ground, is known as the 
True Airspeed (TAS).
Equivalent Airspeed (EAS)
Whenever Density Error is present, Compressibility Error exists.  It is possible to correct CAS 
just for Compressibility Error without correcting for Density Error.  The resultant dynamic 
pressure is then called Equivalent Airspeed (EAS).
Equivalent Airspeed is CAS corrected for Compressibility Error only.
EAS is the most accurate value of dynamic pressure.  It has been corrected for Instrument, 
Pressure and Compressibility error, all of which are forms of measurement error.  EAS is the 
most accurate measure of the dynamic pressure over the wing.  In practice the difference 
between EAS and CAS is not great unless altitude becomes significant.  However, at high 
elevation airports, particularly with high-performance airliners which may have high take-off 
and landing speeds, CAS (and therefore IAS) is higher for the same EAS.
At constant weight, regardless of altitude, an aircraft always lifts off at a constant EAS.
All limit speeds are calculated from EAS, the errors are then re-introduced to display the speeds 
as IAS.
True Airspeed (TAS)
Density Error.  Unless the air round the aircraft is at the calibration density of 1225 grams 
per cubic metre, which can only occur near sea level, the ASI cannot correctly indicate TAS. 
Dynamic pressure is proportional to density, and so at altitude, where density is less, the 
dynamic pressure generated  by a given TAS will  be less than for the same TAS in flight at sea 
level.  ASI capsule expansion will therefore be proportionately less and the speed indicated 
will be less than the true speed.
Summarizing, the ASI under-reads the true speed at altitude as density is less than
1225 grams/cu metre, this  discrepancy being called ‘density error’. If the density is greater 
than ISA at MSL, the ASI will over-read the true speed.
EAS + Density Error = TAS
There is no single instrument that gives a direct reading of density.  Density has to be 
calculated using the interaction of pressure and temperature.  However, pressure is a function 
of altitude.  By combining altitude and temperature information, the density correction is 
derived by the navigational  computer.  The major factor in the density calculation is the 
pressure value.
The calculation of the errors, using a navigation computer, is not required for the 
Instrumentation EASA exam. If you are interested in the calculations, full details of how 
to calculate the errors can be found in the Oxford ATPL Book 10 - General Navigation - 
Chapter 6.

Compressibility Error.  Air is compressible and the pressure produced in the pitot tube is higher 
than it would be for an ideal incompressible fluid, for which the dynamic pressure is ½ρV2.
The ASI is calibrated to allow for this complex compressible flow formula assuming a density 
of 1225 g/cu metre.  If the density is any lower, the standard correction for compressibility 
will be in error.
Because of this, the instrument will over-read, IAS and CAS will be too high, and a subtractive 
compressibility correction will have to be applied 
The correction, which exceeds 20 knots if TAS is near the speed of sound, can be obtained 
from graphs or tables, or it can be applied by high speed navigation computers.
If the TAS is less than 300 knots  the error is small enough to be ignored in the calculation of 
TAS from IAS.
Airspeed Indicator Errors - Application of Corrections
What you see on the instrument is called Indicated Airspeed (IAS). Instrument Error and 
Pressure (or Position) Error are then applied to give Calibrated Airspeed (CAS).  
In practice, we do not have separate cards for the Instrument Error and the Pressure Error.  It 
is simpler to combine both corrections onto a single card.   IAS is therefore corrected for both 
Instrument and Pressure Error by the correction card, to give CAS.
CAS is then corrected for compressibility error to give Equivalent Airspeed (EAS), to allow for 
the fact that the density of air is rarely precisely 1225 grams per cubic metre, which is the value 
for which the ASI is calibrated.  (The ISA atmosphere at Mean Sea Level). In practice, as an 
airline pilot, you are unlikely to deal with EAS and it is rarely encountered outside scientific and 
test flying.  The ASI is already calibrated to allow for compressibility at ISA at MSL and,  under 
those conditions, no compressibility correction is necessary. Compressibility correction is small 
at True Airspeeds (TAS) lower than 300 knots and no correction is considered necessary.
You will therefore always calculate the Density Error correction first to give True Airspeed 
(TAS).  If the TAS you find is 300 knots or less, no further correction is necessary.  If the TAS is 
greater than 300 knots, Compressibility Error correction must be applied.
Limiting Speeds
Some are usually shown on the ASI
VNO = The maximum normal operating limit speed.
VNE = The Never Exceed speed
Vso = The stall speed or the minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration. 
Vs1 = The stall speed or the minimum steady flight speed in a specified configuration. 
VFE = The maximum Flap Extension speed
VYSE = best rate of climb speed with one engine failed

VLO = The maximum Landing Gear Operation speed (up or down).
VLE = The maximum speed Landing Gear Extended speed
ASI ACCURACY TOLERANCE - (CS-25) - + 3% or 5 kt whichever is the greater.
ASI Colour Coding
Some ASIs incorporate coloured markings  on 
the dial - these ‘range markings’ consist of 
coloured arcs and radial lines.
The White Arc denotes the flap operating 
range, from stall at maximum AUW in the 
landing configuration (full flap, landing 
gear down, wings level, power-off) up to VFE 
(maximum flaps extended speed).
The Green Arc denotes the normal operating 
speed range, from stall speed at maximum 
all-up weight (flaps up, wings level) up to VNO 
(‘normal operating limit speed’ or ‘maximum 
structural cruising speed’) which should not 
be exceeded except in smooth air.  Operations 
at IASs in the green arc should be safe in all 
conditions, including turbulence.
The Yellow Arc denotes the caution range, 
which extends from VNO (normal operating limit speed) up to VNE (the never exceed speed). 
The aircraft should be operated at IASs in the caution range only in smooth air.
A Red Radial Line denotes VNE, the never exceed speed.  
Optionally for piston engined light twins:
A blue radial line denotes the best rate of climb speed for one engine out, maximum weight, 
at mean sea level (VYSE).
Pitot and Static Blockages 
Pitot Head.  If the pitot head becomes blocked, the ASI reading will, in general, remain 
unchanged.
In level cruise, a blockage (probably ice, but possibly insects) will lock in the previous pitot 
pressure and any change in actual airspeed will not be registered.  
If altitude is changed with a blocked pitot head and clear static source, the IAS will decrease 
during a descent because the pressure locked inside the capsule remains constant while the 
static pressure of the air surrounding the capsule increases.  Therefore (pitot – static) results in 
an under-reading.  Conversely the IAS increases during a climb with blocked head.
With a blocked pitot source, the ASI under-reads in a descent.

Static Head.  A static head is more exposed to icing conditions and is therefore more likely to 
become obstructed than is a static vent.
A blocked static source during descent will mean that the ‘old’ (higher altitude) static pressure 
surrounding the capsule will be lower than it should be, so that if the pitot supply is normal the 
ASI will over-read.  This could be dangerous in that the aircraft is nearer the stall than the ASI 
is indicating.
Note that a climb with blocked static source and normal pitot air will result in the ASI under-
reading.
With a blocked static source, the ASI over-reads in a descent.
If the alternative static source is selected an error may occur. This error will be due to position 
error. Any dynamic, or turbulence, effects would usually result in a higher static pressure and 
thus produce an under-reading.  This error is known and would be documented in the Flight 
Manual.
Summary.  A useful mnemonic for examinations is PUDSOD, which stands for
‘Pitot Blocked: – Under-reads in Descent      Static Blocked: – Over-reads in Descent’
Pitot and Static Leaks
Pitot Leaks.  A leak in the pitot tube causes the ASI to under-read because of the loss of 
dynamic pressure.
Static Leaks. Static leaks can occur either inside or outside the pressure cabin.   A leak in 
the static tube where the outside pressure is lower than static, which occurs with almost all 
unpressurized aircraft, will cause the ASI to over-read, but probably not significantly.  With a 
pressurized cabin, if the leak occurs within the pressure compartment, the cabin altitude will 
be incorrectly sensed as static pressure, usually rendering the ASI useless.
Serviceability Checks
The following checks of the ASI and pressure supply system should be made before flight:-
•	 Pressure head cover(s) and static vent plug(s) removed and stowed aboard the aircraft.
•	 Pitot tube(s), holes/slots in static head(s) and/or static vent(s) should be checked free from 
obvious obstructions such as insects.
•	 Pitot head heater operative (if fitted).
•	 Dial glass clean and undamaged.
•	 The instrument should indicate airspeed in the correct sense shortly after starting the take-
off run.

The Pressure Altimeter
Principle of Operation
The pressure altimeter is a simple, reliable, pressure gauge calibrated to indicate height.  The 
pressure at a point depends on the weight of the column of air which extends vertically upwards 
from the point to the outer limit of the atmosphere. 
The higher an aircraft is flying, the shorter is the column of air above it and consequently the 
lower is the atmospheric pressure at the aircraft. 
In other words, the greater the height, the lower the pressure, and by measuring the pressure 
the altimeter measures height.
Unfortunately, the relationship between pressure and height is not a linear one, so that 
calibration of the altimeter scale is not a simple matter.  
The situation is further complicated by high and low pressure weather systems which produce 
pressure differences in the horizontal plane.  Furthermore, the temperature of the air at the 
surface and the temperature lapse rate in the air above vary considerably; this affects pressure.
Some Definitions
The pilot should be familiar with the following definitions.
Height	
The vertical distance of a level, point or object considered as a point, measured from a specified 
datum.  
Elevation
The vertical distance of a fixed (non-moving) point or object measured from MSL. 
Altitude
The vertical distance of a moveable object measured from MSL. 
Pressure Altitude
This is the altitude of the aircraft with reference to the pressure level of 1013.25 hPa.

Figure 5.1 Terminology
True  Altitude  
True Height means the height of the aircraft vertically above the surface immediately below. 
Used more often in connection with radio or radar altimeters than with pressure altimeters.
Calibration
The altimeter is calibrated in accordance with the Standard Atmosphere (ISA) over its entire 
operating range. (This range is usually from 5000 ft below sea level up to 80 000 ft).
Note 1: The pressure altimeter is calibrated to give a linear presentation of the non-linear 
atmospheric distribution. This is achieved by the use of a variable magnification lever system 
and the dynamic design of the capsules.
Note 2: Temperature compensation is achieved by the use of a bimetal compensator connected 
in the lever/linkage system.
Note 3: 1013.25 hPa = 29.92 inHg = 14.7 psi

Simple Altimeter
Figure 5.2 Simple altimeter
Static pressure is fed into the case of the instrument from the static source.  As height 
increases, static pressure decreases and the capsule expands under the control of a leaf spring. 
A mechanical linkage magnifies the capsule expansion and converts it to a rotational movement 
of a single pointer over the height scale.  The linkage incorporates a temperature-compensating 
device to minimize errors caused by expansion and contraction of the linkage and changes in 
spring tension due to fluctuations in the temperature of the mechanism. 
Figure 5.2. shows the basic linkage, but the actual arrangements are much more complex.  
The simple altimeter has a setting knob which is geared to the pointer.  With this knob the 
pointer can be set to read zero with the aircraft on the ground so that when airborne the 
altimeter indicates approximate height above aerodrome level.  Alternatively the pointer can 
be set (before flight) to the aerodrome elevation so that when airborne the instrument shows 
approximate height above mean sea level.

Sensitive Altimeter
The Single Pointer Single 
Altimeter was not accurate 
enough, and was developed 
into the Sensitive Altimeter 
illustrated in Figure 5.3.  
The principle of operation is similar to that of the simple altimeter but there are the following 
refinements:-
•	 A bank of two or three capsules gives the increased movement necessary to drive three 
pointers.  These are geared 100:10:1, the smallest indicating 100 000 feet per revolution, the 
next 10 000 feet per revolution and the largest 1000 feet per revolution.
•	 Jewelled bearings are fitted, reducing friction and the associated lag in indications.
Note:	 Some altimeter systems employ “Knocking/Vibrating” devices to help overcome initial 
inertia of the internal gear train when transmitting movement from the capsules to the pointers.
•	 A variable datum mechanism is built in.  This, with the aid of a setting knob, enables the 
instrument to be set to indicate height above any desired pressure datum.
The variable datum mechanism is used as follows:-
The pilot turns the knob until the desired pressure level (say, 1005 hPa) appears on a pressure 
subscale on the face of the instrument.
As the knob is turned, the height pointers rotate until, when the procedure is completed with 
the subscale showing the desired 1005, the altimeter indicates the aircraft’s height above this 
pressure level.  
If for instance the aerodrome level pressure happened to be 1005 hPa, the altimeter would be 
reading height above the aerodrome.  Further details of the procedural uses of the pressure 
subscale are given later in this chapter.  The subscale setting only changes when the pilot turns 
the knob.  A change in altitude or surface pressure has no direct effect on the reading of the 
subscale.  As the pilot alters the subscale setting, the altimeter pointers move, but the design 
of the mechanism is such that the reverse does not apply (for example, during a climb, the 
pointers rotate but the subscale setting remains unchanged).  British altimeters have a subscale 
setting range between 800 to 1050 hectopascals.

Reading Accuracy
The simple altimeter is not sensitive, recording 
perhaps 20 000 ft for each revolution of its 
single pointer.  The three-pointer instrument 
gives a much more sensitive indication of 
height and change of height but suffers from 
the severe disadvantage that it can be easily 
misread.  
It is not difficult for the pilot to make a reading 
error of 10 000 ft, particularly during a rapid 
descent under difficult conditions with a high 
flightdeck workload.  
Accidents have occurred as a result of such 
misreading.  Various modifications to the 
pointers and warning systems have been 
tried with the object of preventing this error, 
including a striped warning sector which 
appears as the aircraft descends through the 
16 000 foot level.

Figure 5.5 Counter / pointer altimeter
The 
greatest 
advance 
has 
been 
the 
introduction of the counter-pointer altimeter, 
illustrated in Figure 5.5, which gives a much 
more positive indication than the three-
pointer dial drawn in Figure 5.4.
With further reference to Figure 5.5, it will be 
realized that though the digital counters give 
an unambiguous indication of the aircraft’s 
height, they give a relatively poor display of 
the rate of change of height.  
For this reason the instrument also has a single 
pointer which makes one revolution per 1000 
feet, giving the clear indication of change of 
height which is extremely important to the 
pilot, particularly on the final approach in 
instrument conditions.

Servo-assisted Altimeters
Though at least one counter-pointer altimeter driven directly by pressure capsules has been 
produced, most instruments of the type are servo-assisted.  This servo-assistance not only 
gives the altimeter an increased operating range but also improves the instrument accuracy, 
particularly at high levels.  
At high altitude the change in pressure corresponding to a given change in height is much 
smaller than at low altitude.  
This means that for a given height change, capsule movement at high altitude is relatively 
small, and frictional resistance in the linkage of an unassisted altimeter causes correspondingly 
greater errors and more lag.  With servo-assistance, the requisite power is available to overcome 
the frictional resistance with consequently enhanced instrument accuracy.
The principle of the servo altimeter is that the small movements of the capsules are detected 
by a very sensitive electromagnetic pick-off.  This produces an electric current which is amplified 
and used to drive a motor which rotates the counters and pointer.

AC is fed to the middle leg of the E bar, setting up alternating magnetic fields in the outer legs 
‘A’ and ‘B’.  
The coils on these two legs are wound 180° out of phase.  The exciter therefore induces a 
current in each leg, but since these are 180° out of phase and of equal strength, they cancel 
each other out when the I bar is equidistant from the legs of the E bar (that is when no pressure 
change acts on the capsules).
With a change of pressure the capsules expand or contract, moving the I bar on its pivot, 
closing the gap between the I Bar and E Bar at one end and opening it at the other.
--- Page 66 ---
The Pressure Altimeter

The Pressure Altimeter
This causes an imbalance of magnetic fields and therefore of the currents induced in the ‘A’ 
and ‘B’ coils.  The imbalance causes an error signal which is passed to the amplifier, where it is 
amplified and rectified, and thence to the servomotor.  
The servomotor drives the counter-pointer system of the altimeter and at the same time, via a 
cam drive, re-aligns the E Bar with the I Bar.  
Once re-aligned, the error signal ceases and the altimeter indicates the correct height.
In this system the only work required of the capsules is to move the I Bar, eliminating the 
effects of friction and manufacturing imperfections in the gearing of a conventional altimeter.
This type of altimeter is sensitive to very small pressure changes and therefore more accurate 
than the sensitive altimeter, particularly at high altitudes where pressure changes (per unit 
height increment) are very small.  The lag experienced in other types of altimeter with rapid 
changes of height is greatly reduced.
The normal instrument error is approximately equivalent to the effect of 1 hPa change of 
pressure (about 30 ft at MSL, 50 ft at 20 000 ft, or 100 ft at 40 000 ft).
The tolerance at MSL (CS-25) is +/- 30 ft per 100 kt CAS

Altimeter Errors
The errors which affect altimeters are many and the extent of some of them varies with 
altimeter type.  Much effort is expended on improving instrument accuracy, and the permissible 
tolerances of modern altimeters are smaller than with earlier types.  
There are other errors caused by deviation of the actual atmosphere from standard conditions, 
and also the difficulty in sensing correctly the outside air pressure.  A list of the main errors 
follows.
Position (or Pressure) Error
This is largely due to the inability to sense the true static pressure outside the aircraft, as 
described in the chapter on Pressure Heads.  The error is usually small but increases at high Mach 
numbers (and, consequently, at high altitudes usually associated with high Mach numbers).  
Instrument Error
Manufacturing  imperfections, including friction in the linkage, cause errors throughout the 
operating range.  The errors are kept as small as possible by adjustments within the instrument, 
and the calibration procedure ensures that they are within permitted tolerances.  Residual 
errors may be listed on a correction card.  
Note: With the sensitive altimeter the error increases with altitude, which also explains why the 
decrease of accuracy with altitude is less serious with the servo altimeter.
Manoeuvre-induced Error
This is caused by transient fluctuations of pressure at the static vent during change of, mainly, 
pitch attitude and delays in the transmission of pressure changes due to viscous and acoustic 
effects in the static pipeline.  This is discussed more fully in Chapter 2 dealing with pressure 
heads.
Barometric Error
Providing the altimeter has a pressure subscale, and the local pressure is set on it, the altimeter 
will indicate height AMSL (though still subject to the other errors).  If the local surface pressure 
has changed since the pressure value was set, a ‘barometric’ error of roughly 30 feet per 
hectopascal will result.  If pressure has fallen, the altimeter over-reads.
Example Problem
Exam questions sometimes include the term ‘height involved’. This complicates matters. Think 
carefully when answering.
An aircraft flies from ‘A’ to ‘B’ at a constant indicated altitude of 10 000 feet with the pressure 
at ‘A’ of 1025 hPa set on the subscale THROUGHOUT THE FLIGHT.  On arrival overhead ‘B’, 
where the pressure is 995 hPa, what will be the true altitude (assuming that there are no other 
errors, and assuming that 1 hPa corresponds to 30 feet)?

Figure 5.8 Datum diagram
Solution
The altimeter indicates the height above the 1025 hPa pressure datum set on the subscale.  At 
‘A’, 1025 hPa is the MSL pressure so the aircraft is actually 10 000 feet above MSL.  When it gets 
to ‘B’ where MSL pressure is 995 hPa, the 1025 hPa level will be below sea level, remembering 
that pressure decreases as height increases.  The amount involved is 1025 - 995 = 30 hPa, or 
30 × 30 = 900 feet.  The altimeter is now indicating 10 000 feet above a datum which is 900 
feet below MSL.  The true altitude (actual height AMSL) of the aircraft must therefore be 
10 000 - 900 = 9100 feet.  The altimeter indicates 10 000 feet but the true altitude is 9100 feet. 
The instrument is over-reading, and the aircraft is closer to the surface than is indicated.  This is 
a potentially dangerous situation, occurring in flight from HIGH TO LOW pressure causing the 
altimeter to read HIGH.  A datum diagram such as that shown in Figure 5.8 helps to sort out 
this type of problem.
Remember:
Pressure always decreases as altitude increases.
The altimeter indicates height above the datum set on the subscale.
Time Lag
With many types of altimeter the response to change of height is not instantaneous.  This 
causes the altimeter to under-read in a climb and over-read in a descent.  The lag is most 
noticeable when the change in altitude is rapid and prolonged.  In the laboratory calibration 
of the sensitive altimeter, the lag between increasing readings and decreasing readings should 
not exceed 150 feet.  With servo-assisted altimeters there is said to be no appreciable lag unless 
the rate of change of height exceeds 10 000 feet per minute.  This is because the servo altimeter 
does not suffer from the linkage friction which causes a much larger error in the sensitive 
altimeter.

    The Pressure Altimeter

The Pressure Altimeter
Temperature Error.
Even with no other errors at all, the pressure altimeter will not indicate true altitude (height 
AMSL) unless the surface temperature and lapse rate of the column of air are those assumed 
in the calibration. 
When flying in colder air (with an air density greater than ISA at that altitude), the altimeter 
will over-read. 
Where the temperature at cruising level deviates from standard, an approximate correction 
can be made with most navigational computers.  The correction can only be approximate since 
temperatures in the rest of the column of air are not known.  The correction is considered too 
inaccurate to be worth making at heights above 25 000 feet.
Example Problem
The indicated altitude is 10 000 feet with local pressure set and a COAT (corrected outside air 
temperature) of -25°C.  Will the true altitude be more or less than the indicated value?
Solution
The ISA temperature at 10 000 feet would be about -5°C, so the aircraft is flying in colder-than-
standard conditions (ISA minus 20°).  Pressure decreases more rapidly in cold than in warm air. 
Therefore, assuming a constant surface pressure, the pressure at a given true altitude in the 
cold air will be less than at the same altitude in ‘standard’ air.  The altimeter in the cold air will 
interpret this lower pressure as a higher altitude and will therefore over-read the true altitude. 
Using the computer set indicated altitude, 10 000 feet, against a COAT of -25°C in the Altitude 
window.  Read off the true altitude, about 9250 feet, on the outer scale against 10 000 feet on 
the inner scale.  (An approximation of 4 feet per 1°C away from ISA per 1000 feet above sea 
level, may be used as a rough guide). Students should use the mathematical method for exam 
purposes.
Thus, in flight from HIGH TO LOW TEMPERATURE the altimeter would read HIGH.  This is 
potentially unsafe, and is comparable to the case of barometric error illustrated in the previous 
worked example where with flight from HIGH TO LOW PRESSURE the altimeter also reads 
HIGH.

Standard Datum Settings
Standard Setting
When 1013.25 hPa is set on the subscale, the altimeter reading is called “Pressure Altitude”.
If 1013.25 hPa is set, an aircraft would normally fly Flight Levels. A Flight Level is the aircraft’s 
height, above 1013.25 hPa, expressed in 100s of feet. Flight Levels only occur at 500 ft intervals. 
(e.g. 4500 ft will be FL45, or FL360 will be 36 000 ft.)
QFE
This is aerodrome level pressure, which when set on the subscale, will cause the altimeter of an 
aircraft on the ground to read zero, assuming there is no instrument error.  In flight, with QFE 
set, the altimeter will indicate height above the aerodrome QFE reference datum, provided ISA 
conditions exist between aerodrome level and the aircraft and there are no other altimeter 
errors. In practice, QFE is used mainly for circuit-flying and gives a good indication of height 
above the aerodrome, any errors involved being only small.	
QNH
This is the equivalent MSL pressure calculated by Air Traffic Control from the aerodrome level 
pressure assuming ISA conditions prevail between aerodrome level and MSL.  With QNH set on 
the subscale, the altimeter of an aircraft on the aerodrome indicates aerodrome elevation, that 
is, the height AMSL (if there is no instrument error).  In flight the altimeter will indicate altitude 
but this will only be the true altitude if the mean temperature in the column of air beneath 
the aircraft is the same as in ISA conditions (assuming there are no other altimeter errors).  If 
conditions are different from standard, the indicated altitude, sometimes called QNH altitude, 
may deviate considerably from true altitude.  The navigational computer can be used to make 
an approximate correction for this temperature error.
Regional QNH
More correctly called ‘lowest forecast QNH’, this setting, forecast by the Met. Office, is used to 
ensure safe terrain clearance.  It is the value below which QNH is forecast not to fall in a given 
period and area.  	
The value should be lower than the actual QNH anywhere in the area, and if set on the subscale, 
regional QNH will cause the altimeter to under-read (so erring on the safe side - the altimeter 
showing aircraft to be lower than it actually is).

Blockages and Leaks
If the static source becomes blocked, the 
altimeter will not register any change in height 
- the height at which the blockage occurred 
will still be indicated regardless of any climb 
or descent.  On many aircraft, an alternative 
source of static pressure will be available.
Should the static line fracture in a pressurized 
aircraft, the altimeter will show the (lower) 
cabin altitude rather than aircraft altitude
A fracture in the static line within an 
unpressurized aircraft will normally result in 
the altimeter over-reading, due to the pressure 
in the cabin being lower than ambient due 
to aerodynamic suction. See Chapter 2 
Emergency Static Source.
If the aircraft is CLIMBING then the altimeter 
will UNDER-READ.
If the aircraft is DESCENDING then the altimeter will OVER-READ.
The amount of the error will increase as the aircraft moves away from the height at which the 
blockage occured.
Density Altitude
Density altitude can be defined as the altitude in the standard atmosphere at which the 
prevailing density would occur, or alternatively, as the altitude in the standard atmosphere 
corresponding to the prevailing pressure and temperature.  It is a convenient parameter in

In the UK, the apron is the 
designated location for pre-
flight altimeter checks (the 
apron being the loading and 
unloading and/or parking 
area). 
 
Apron 
elevation 
is displayed in the flight 
clearance 
office 
of 
the 
aerodrome concerned and 
is also published in the AGA 
section of the UK Air Pilot.

The Pressure Altimeter
Example Problem
Calculate the instrument error from the following details of a preflight altimeter check:
Aerodrome elevation	 	
	
	
235 feet
Apron elevation	
	
	
	
225 feet
Height of altimeter above apron	
	
20 feet
Altimeter reading with QFE set	
	
40 feet
Solution
The apron is 10 feet below the stated aerodrome elevation so assuming the QFE to be for the 
aerodrome level, an altimeter on the apron should read (-10) feet.  However, the instrument 
is positioned in the aircraft 20 feet above the apron so it should show (-10) + 20 = +10 feet.  Its 
actual reading is +40 feet so it is over-reading by 30 feet, an instrument error of +30 feet.

         The Vertical Speed  Indicator
6
              
The Vertical Speed Indicator
Introduction
A pilot can get some idea of his rate of climb 
or descent from the angular rate of change 
of the altimeter pointer.  However, there are 
times when a more accurate indication is 
necessary, such as achieving a certain height 
loss within a specified time on airways or in 
setting up a smooth rate of descent on a glide 
path on an instrument approach.
The Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI) displays rate 
of climb or descent.  The instrument senses 
rate of change of static by comparing the 
present static pressure with the static pressure 
measured 4-6 seconds earlier.
The VSI can also be known as the Rate of Climb and Descent Indicator (RCDI).
Principle
When an aircraft departs from level flight, the 
static pressure will change.  The VSI measures 
the pressure difference between each side of 
a restricted choke/metering unit.  
In level flight the pressures on each side of the 
choke are the same, during a climb or descent, 
air fed to the choke immediately responds to 
the change of atmospheric pressure but the 
choke transmits this change at a lower rate.
Construction
A capsule within an airtight case is fed with 
static pressure.  The case is also fed with static 
pressure but through a restricted choke, thus 
if the static pressure is changed the pressure 
surrounding the capsule changes at a slower 
rate than that within the capsule, as shown 
in Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.3.  For example, 
if the aircraft is climbing, the pressure in the 
capsule will be less than that in the case, the 
consequent compression of the capsule is 
converted by a suitable linkage to a pointer 
indication of rate of climb.

VSI Metering Unit
The restrictor (or choke, or metering unit) is more complicated than a simple hole.  The static 
pressure change is actually hectopascals/min, but the pilot needs to see an indication of feet/
min, whatever the altitude.  However, there are more feet to a hectopascal at higher altitudes 
than lower altitudes, and therefore the rate of pressure change with altitude at different 
altitudes needs to be compensated for.
This is achieved by a combination of different types of hole (called ‘capillary’ and ‘orifice’).  Use 
of a suitable combination of these gives a near-constant indication in feet/minute, whatever 
the actual altitude and therefore, whatever the actual pressure differential needed.
Display
Figure 6.4 The VSI Display
The Errors of the VSI
Instrument Error.  Due to manufacturing imperfections.
Position (or Pressure) Error.  If the static pressure is subject to position error the VSI will 
wrongly indicate a climb or descent when speed is suddenly changed; this is most noticeable 
during take-off acceleration.
Manoeuvre-induced Error.  Any short term fluctuations in pressure at the static vent during 
attitude changes will cause the instrument to indicate a false rate of climb or descent.  
Additionally with most VSIs, the linkage includes a small counterbalance weight, the inertia of 
which causes delays in the indications of changes in vertical speed during manoeuvres.
Time Lag.  The pointer takes a few seconds to steady because of the time taken to build up a 
steady pressure difference on climb or descent.  There will also be a time lag on levelling out 
because of the time taken for the pressures to equalize.  This error is most noticeable after a 
prolonged climb or descent, especially at a high rate.

The Vertical Speed Indicator
Any blockages of the static line or vent will cause the needle to return to zero.  If the supply 
of air to this instrument is blocked it is probable that the other pressure instruments (ASI, 
altimeter and Machmeter) will also be affected.
The Instantaneous Vertical Speed Indicator
To overcome the problem of lag, the Instantaneous Vertical Speed Indicator (IVSI)  incorporates 
an accelerometer unit (sometimes called a dashpot or dynamic vane)  which responds quickly 
to a change of altitude.  
The figure below shows an IVSI at the beginning of a descent.  
The piston in the vertical acceleration pump immediately rises in the cylinder and causes a 
temporary increase of pressure in the capsule.  The capsule expands and the pointer will give 
an instant indication of descent.
As the initial acceleration is turned into a steady rate of descent, the piston will slowly descend 
to its original position, but by this time the correct differential pressure between the capsule 
and the case will have been set up and the correct rate of descent will continue to be shown.

Errors Peculiar to the IVSI.  Because of the sensitivity of the dashpot assembly, the instrument 
tends to overreact to turbulent flying conditions and small fluctuations should be ignored.
In a steep, level turn, the piston will tend to sink towards the bottom of the cylinder and there 
will be a false indication of a climb.

Presentation
Two types of presentation are available, a linear scale and a logarithmic scale, this latter 
presentation being more easily read at the lower rates of climb/descent. This is easily discerned 
from the figures below. 
It should be noted that diaphragm overload stops may be fitted to prevent damage to the 
instrument should the rate of climb/descent exceed the maximum to which the instrument is 
calibrated.  On some instruments a zeroing screw is fitted.

Serviceability Checks
On the Ground
•	 The instrument should read zero, or the error should be within the permissible limits
•	 +/- 200 feet per minute at temperatures – 20°C + 50°C
•	 +/- 300 feet per minute outside these temperatures
•	 There should be no apparent damage to the instrument.
In the Air
The accuracy of the instrument may be checked against the altimeter and a stopwatch during 
a steady climb/descent and the instrument should indicate zero climb or descent when in level 
flight.

The Machmeter 
High Speed Flight
In high speed aircraft the Machmeter is an essential instrument.  As an aircraft approaches the 
local speed of sound the airflow over some parts of the fuselage or wings may be accelerated 
up to the speed of sound and a shock wave will form. These shock waves cause more drag, less 
lift, Mach tuck, buffeting, and reduction in control effectiveness or loss of control. (Mach tuck 
is a downward-pitching sudden change of trim which can be severe).
In order to avoid danger associated with flight at high Mach numbers, a limiting Mach number 
will be specified for each aircraft, based on flight trials.  This must not be exceeded.  It is known 
as MMO.
The Machmeter therefore displays the present Mach number so that the pilot can keep his 
speed below the particular MMO for his aircraft and avoid the problems associated with high 
speed flight.
Speed of Sound
The speed of sound is not constant but varies with air temperature. A formula for calculating 
the local speed of sound (LSS) is:
LSS  =  38.95  √T
where,
LSS is given in knots,   
38.95 is a constant, 
and 
T is the absolute temperature, (0°C = 273°A = 273 K)
Therefore the higher the air temperature, the higher the speed of sound, and vice versa.  Since 
temperature normally reduces as altitude increases, the speed of sound normally reduces as 
altitude increases.  
In ISA conditions at mean sea level (+15°C) the speed of sound is 661 knots, while at 30 000 feet 
ISA (- 45°C) the speed of sound will have reduced to 589 knots.

Machmeter Principle of Operation
The Machmeter uses two capsules and linkages to indicate the aircrafts True Airspeed (TAS) as 
a proportion of the local speed of sound (LSS)
The first capsule is an Airspeed Capsule which will expand and contract as a result of changes 
in the dynamic pressure.

The second capsule is a sealed Altimeter Capsule which will expand and contract as the static 
pressure inside the instrument case changes.

The Machmeter 
Machmeter Construction
Figure 7.1 shows the parts of a Machmeter.  It consists of a simple aneroid altitude capsule and 
an airspeed capsule which are connected at the ratio arm.  
Static pressure enters the case of the instrument, while pitot pressure is fed directly into the 
airspeed capsule.  Expansion or contraction of  the airspeed capsule is transmitted via the 
airspeed link and main shaft to the ratio arm, but the position of the ratio arm is also governed 
by expansion or contraction of the altitude capsule.
A spring-loaded ranging arm transmits the movement of the ratio arm to the pointer 
mechanism.
Basically, if either or both capsules expand (due to an increase in IAS and/or altitude) then the 
ranging arm will rotate out of the diagram and the indicated Mach Number will increase.  If 
airspeed or altitude reduce then the ratio and ranging arms move back into the paper, and a 
lower Mach number is displayed.
An adjustable index on the instrument scale can be positioned by means of a small knob.  This 
index can be set to the limiting Mach number for the aircraft type (in straight and level flight), 
to provide a visual warning to the pilot. 
Machmeter Errors
The Machmeter suffers from instrument, position and manoeuvre induced errors only.  It 
does not suffer from temperature or density errors, as these errors cancel out. In addition since 
compressibility error depends on dynamic/static pressure, and the instrument is calibrated to 
this ratio, compressibility error is calibrated out.
Position Error
The instrument uses the same sources of pitot and static pressure as the ASI and therefore 
suffers from position error caused by disturbed airflow at the pitot head and/or static vent.  At 
low Mach numbers below, careful design and positioning of the pressure sources ensure that 
position error on modern jet aircraft is small.  However, at higher Mach Numbers, changes in 
airflow may cause position error to become bigger and possibly change its sign.  If the sign of 
the position error is such that the Machmeter under-reads, the error could become dangerous 
at high Mach numbers.  The normal arrangement in modern jet transport aircraft is to allow for 
instrument and position error such that the Machmeter always over-reads.
Manoeuvre Induced Error
The Machmeter will suffer an additional, unpredictable error whenever the aeroplane 
manoeuvres.  This is due to the unpredictable changes in the airflow over the static source.

The Machmeter
Blockages
Static Source Blocked.  If the static source is blocked, the pressure in the Machmeter case will 
not alter when the aircraft climbs or descends.
If a blockage occurs in a climb, the altitude capsule will not move.  Assuming a constant IAS 
(and therefore a constant dynamic pressure) the airspeed capsule will contract as the static 
component of pitot pressure reduces.  The Machmeter will therefore under-read.
If a blockage occurs in a descent, at a constant IAS, the airspeed capsule will expand due to 
the increasing static component of pitot pressure.  The Machmeter will therefore over-read.
Pitot Source Blocked.  Assuming a climb or descent at a constant IAS (and therefore a constant 
dynamic pressure) the Machmeter will over-read in the climb and under-read in the descent. 
In the climb the airspeed capsule will expand in error because the static component of  pitot in 
the capsule will be greater than the static in the case.  In the descent the static component of 
pitot will be too small and therefore the airspeed capsule will contract.
Note:  It may be noticed that the Machmeter blockage errors are the same as the ASI blockage 
errors.

Machmeter Summary
Mach number = TAS/LSS.
Speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, and therefore 
decreases with the decrease in temperature normally encountered with increase in altitude.
While climbing at a constant Mach number, TAS decreases and CAS decreases more rapidly, 
the LSS also decreases.
While climbing at a constant CAS, TAS and Mach number increase but the LSS decreases.
Remember that in calculations involving the Jet Standard Atmosphere, the temperature is 
assumed to be +15°C at MSL with a lapse rate of 2° per 1000 with no upper limit (i.e. no 
tropopause).

The Machmeter 
Climb at a Constant CAS in Standard (ISA) Atmosphere
If we were to climb at 330 kt CAS from sea 
level to 36 000 ft in the standard atmosphere,
•	 TAS will increase from 330 kt to 593 kt, and 
•	 Mach number will increase from M 0.5 to 
M 1.05.
The rapid rise of Mach number (in this case far exceeding MMO) is the reason why high 
performance aircraft are flown on CAS (or IAS) for the first part of the climb before transferring 
to a constant Mach number for the rest of the climb.  Similarly in the descent at constant CAS, 
TAS and Mach number reduce, with Mach number reducing at a greater rate.
This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 7.2.  For a constant CAS (blue line) as altitude increases, 
TAS (the green line) increases, and Mach number (the red line) increases at a greater rate.  The 
navigation computer can also be used to show the relationship between CAS, TAS and Mach 
number but also gives us an idea of magnitude.
Now consider a descent at M 0.8 from 40 000 ft to sea level in the jet standard atmosphere on 
the navigation computer.
At 40 000 ft M 0.8 is 450 kt TAS, at sea level it 
has increased to 528 kt.  The CAS has increased 
more markedly from 242 kt at 40 000 ft to 528 
kt at mean sea level.  This would exceed VMO. 
Therefore although Mach number is used at 
altitude, CAS will be used in the descent.	
Note:  You will have probably noticed by now 
that the relationship of CAS, TAS and Mach 
number as an aeroplane climbs or descends 
through the standard atmosphere remains the 
same.  That is Figure 7.2. and Figure 7.3. are 
the same - just tilted to one side or the other. 
Therefore when considering the climb/descent 
through an isothermal layer and an inversion 
only the constant TAS figure will be shown.
Descent at a Constant Mach Number in Standard Conditions
During a descent in the ISA, the LSS will be increasing (as temperature increases).  Therefore 
if Mach number is being kept constant the TAS must be increasing (Mach number = TAS/LSS) 
During the descent air density increases and if TAS is also increasing the CAS must also increase 
at a greater rate (Dynamic Pressure = ½ ρ V2) .  This is shown in Figure 7.3.  Similarly in a climb 
at constant Mach number the TAS or CAS both reduce.

The Machmeter
Climb and Descent through an Isothermal Layer
Constant Mach number
An isothermal layer is a layer of air in which 
the temperature does not change.  Therefore 
the LSS will not change, and for a constant 
Mach number the TAS will not alter.  The CAS 
will change however due to density error, 
reducing during the climb and increasing 
during a descent.
Constant CAS
Climbing at a constant CAS, the TAS and Mach 
number will both increase (at the same rate).
Climb and Descent through an Inversion
Constant Mach Number
In an inversion the temperature of the air will 
increase (get warmer) as altitude increases. 
Therefore in a climb the LSS will increase, 
and for a constant Mach number the TAS will 
increase. 
(Mach number = TAS/LSS).  
CAS will reduce as air density reduces. 
Descending at a constant Mach number the 
TAS will reduce and the CAS will increase.
Constant CAS
Climbing at a constant CAS, the TAS and Mach number will both increase (TAS at a greater rate 
than Mach number).  
Climb/Descent Summary
In summary;
TAS will always increase when an aeroplane climbs at a constant CAS. 
 
Climbing at a constant TAS the CAS will always reduce.  
This is because pressure has a greater effect on air density than temperature.
Climbing at a constant CAS the Mach number will always increase. 
Climbing at a constant Mach number the CAS will always reduce.  
This is because the CAS/TAS density error dominates over the change in LSS due to temperature 
variation.

Example Problems Associated with the Machmeter
Problem 1:	
What is the speed of sound at FL380 in ISA conditions?
Solution 1:
In the ISA atmosphere FL380 is above the tropopause and therefore the temperature will be - 
56.5°C or 216.5 K 
	
LSS 	
=   38.95  √T
	
	
=   38.95  √216.5
	
	
=   573 knots
These calculations can also be completed on the navigation computer. Place the Mach number 
index arrow against the temperature (in °C), locate M 1.0 (the blue 10 on the navigation 
computer) on the inner Mach number scale and read off the TAS on the outer scale.
Problem 2:	
Determine the TAS corresponding to M 0.70 at JSA MSL (+15°C or 288 K).
Solution 2:
Using the computer, set the Mach number index against +15°C in the Airspeed window.  Against 
7 (for M 0.7) on the inner scale, read off the answer (463 knots) on the outer scale.
Alternatively calculate TAS from the formula 
TAS 	
=   Mach number  ×  LSS
	
=   0.7  ×  38.95 √288
	
=   0.7 ×  661  =  463 knots
Problem 3:	
Calculate without using a computer the altitude in the JSA atmosphere at 	 	
which a TAS of 450 knots corresponds to Mach 0.80
Solution 3:
Mach Number  =  TAS
LSS
	
	
LSS  =  TAS
MN
LSS   =  450
0.8   =  562.5  kt
	
	
However, LSS =  38.95 √T	
√T  = LSS
38.95      =  LSS
38.95
    =   14.44
T = 14.442 = 209°
T = 209° Absolute which is equal to - 64°C
- 64°C occurs at FL395 in the JSA which has no tropopause.

Problem 4:	
If a decrease of 0.12 in the Mach number results in a decrease of 80 knots in the 
TAS, what is the local speed of sound?
Solution 4:
Mach Number  =  TAS
LSS
	
	
LSS  =  TAS
MN
LSS   =  
80
0.12     =   667  kt
 Problem 5:	
An aircraft is flying at FL360 with a TAS of 467 knots at Mach 0.8 when the 
temperature difference from JSA is +9. What is the temperature difference at 
FL320 if Mach 0.8 still gives a TAS of 467 knots?
Solution 5:
At FL360 in JSA temp would be - 57°C. JSA +9 would be - 48°C
However if Mach No. and TAS remain the same, then we must be flying in an isothermal layer, 
so the temperature of - 48°C and the LSS would remain the same.
If the temperature at FL320 is also - 48°, temp deviation from standard must be + 1° as JSA 
should be - 49°C.
Mach / Airspeed Indicator
Since many commercial aircraft require indications of both IAS and Mach number, it is sensible 
to combine both instruments.  The basic principals of both instruments still apply.
Errors
The combined instrument will have the errors of both the Machmeter and the airspeed indicator, 
namely; instrument, position, manoeuvre induced, density and compressibility errors.
Construction
There are two types of Mach/Airspeed Indicator:
•	 A self-contained instrument fed from pitot and static sources.
•	 A combined instrument fed from the Air Data Computer.	
Note that:
•	 The airspeed pointer moves clockwise over a fixed scale.
•	 From M 0.5 the Mach number is read off the same pointer as it moves over a moving 
Mach number scale.  This scale rotates anticlockwise beneath the pointer as Mach 
number increases. 
•	 A second striped needle may be present to mark VMO.

If the aircraft is fitted with an Air Data Computer (ADC) it will measure pitot pressure, static 
pressure and Total Air Temperature and then electronically, send the information to any 
instruments and other computers which require it. The advantages related to the combined 
Mach/Airspeed instrument are:
•	 The ability to correct for instrument and position errors to give Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) 
instead of IAS.	
•	 The use of a digital displays for both Mach number and CAS.

Introduction
In many large aircraft currently in service, the conventional pressure instruments which show 
altitude, airspeed and Mach Number(MNo) are replaced by indicators displaying information 
generated by a central computer, the Air Data Computer (ADC). The computer unit and 
displays, together with the sensors of the basic data of pitot pressure, static pressure and 
air temperature, and a power-pack, form the aircraft’s Air Data System (ADS).  Whilst such a 
system is self-contained, its outputs are essential to the operation of the aircraft’s Automatic 
Flight Control System (AFCS). ADS outputs may also be used in the altitude transponder, flight 
data recorder, navigation computer and more.
A number of different aircraft types may use the same basic Air Data Computer and this device 
will need to be integrated into the aircraft systems and this is achieved by a “Configuration 
Module”. The module can be  calibrated to take into account  differences in pressure/
temperature gathering efficiencies due to positioning of the gathering  probes and this 
information can then be entered into the computer to obtain the most accurate indications 
possible.
The standard ADS instruments show altitude, vertical speed, airspeed and MNo.  Additional 
instruments can display Total Air Temperature (TAT), Static Air Temperature (SAT) and TAS.  A 
schematic diagram of a conventional ADS is shown in Figure 8.1.

the ground.
AOA may also be an input to the ADC for use in some aircraft systems.

Pitot - Static System
In a typical aircraft, identical sets of air data instruments are provided on the Captain’s and 
First Officer’s instrument panels.  Each set of instruments is connected to one of two (allowing 
redundancy) ADCs fed from independent pitot and static sources, which can be cross-
connected, as shown in Figure 8.3.  In addition to the indicators powered by the two ADCs 
there is a standby barometric altimeter and a standby airspeed indicator, fed direct from pitot 
and static sources separate from those used for the ADCs.  Each of the three independent pitot-
static systems makes use of cross-coupled static vents located on each side of the fuselage.  This 
arrangement is designed to reduce error due to side-slip or yaw.
Air Data Computer
The Air Data Computer in current aircraft is a device that uses analogue or digital computing 
techniques to convert pressure and temperature data into electrical signals which are 
transmitted to the display instruments and to other systems.
The two types of ADC system found are described as either Analogue or Digital from the 
method of assessment and transmission of information used.
The analogue type uses continuous physical variables, such as voltage or pressure, to assess 
and represent the measurements  obtained.  The illustration at Figure 8.2 shows an airspeed 
assessment device from an Analogue ADC indicating the inputs of static and pitot pressure. 
The pressures are joined together mechanically and, using a Pressure Transducer, transmitted 
forward for use through the rotation of a shaft driven by a 2-phase servomotor which in turn 
is connected to a CX synchro where angular position can be measured and read off as an 
airspeed.
Figure 8.2 Analogue ADC - airspeed assessment
An analogue Air Data Computer may internally be split into the following modules for 
assessment and onward transmission of data obtained through the temperature, static and 
pitot pressure gathering devices - Altitude, Computed Airspeed, Mach Speed, True Airspeed 
and using data from the altitude module via a Rate of Climb module will give vertical speed.

Air Data Computer
The relationships between TAS, Mach No., temperature, pitot and static pressures can be 
expressed as mathematical formulae.  The ADC resolves these formulae continuously to produce 
the required outputs from pressure and temperature inputs in the form of shaft rotations or 
electrical signals.
The Digital system uses digital data (binary data) in its assessment and transmission of 
information.  The Analogue to Digital Converters, at the input side of the ADC, use 
measurements of pressure, temperature and AOA and change them from the analogue form 
to digital form for use within the ADC and onward transmission to the flight deck.
System Redundancy
Provision for blockages and / 
or failure of an ADC is made 
through change-over cocks 
that permit an alternative 
static source to be connected 
to the computer or by the 
use of electrical switching 
that enables the Captain’s 
instrument to be  fed from the 
First Officer’s ADC and vice 
versa.  These arrangements 
are illustrated in Figure 8.3 
and Figure 8.4.
In some aircraft the ADS is 
designed so that the outputs 
from each computer are 
not directed exclusively to 
instruments on one side of the 
panel.  By mixing the sources 
of air data to each side, the 
possibility of an undetected 
malfunction is reduced.
In the event of total failure 
of both ADCs due perhaps 
to loss of power supply, the 
flight can be continued by 
reference to the standby 
instruments.
Failure Warning
A comparison monitor can be incorporated to compare the outputs of the ADCs and to give 
automatic warning to the pilot of malfunction.  With a purely mechanical system, comparison 
between left-hand and right-hand instruments must be carried out visually. A warning flag will 
appear on the appropriate ADS instrument if there is loss of valid data or if an internal failure 
occurs.  In addition, a light will illuminate either on the instrument warning panel or on the 
central warning system indicator.

Built-in Test Equipment (BIT or BITE)
There is no provision made for the manual input of data into the ADC in the event of any failure, 
but the Built-in Test Equipment will give prompt indication of any malfunction that might occur. 
(See ‘Failure Warning’ below).  In any ADC there will be three types of BITE process:
Power Up BITE
This functions when power is applied to the ADC on start-up or after a break.  A check is made 
on the Microprocessor, the Memory Store and the Air Data functions.
Continuous BITE
This is an automatic check of all stages of input and output carried out throughout the operation 
of the ADC about once every second.
Maintenance BITE
This enables maintenance crew to carry out checks on the ground using a Test or Test/History 
switch (current or post failures).
Advantages of an Air Data System.
An ADS has certain advantages when compared with conventional mechanical instruments:
Improved Displays
Electrically-servoed instrumentation allows the manufacturer complete freedom to design new 
displays that are easier to read and unambiguous.  These include digital, moving tape and 
combined displays.
Reduced Instrument and Lag Errors
The major cause of instrument error in conventional mechanical instruments is friction loss 
within the linkage.  The limited response rate of such linkages gives rise to lag error.  Both 
problems are largely overcome with ADSs by the use of servomotors.
Error Correction
Computation of height, airspeed and other variables within one computer permits error 
corrections to be applied through especially shaped cams appropriate to the particular aircraft. 
For example, position error correction (PEC) can be calculated within the Mach No. computer 
channel for additional use within the height and airspeed channels.
Central Source for Other Systems
The ADC provides not only the conventional information displayed on the instrument panel 
but also air data in many forms as required for other systems.
Clean Design
The use of electrically-driven instruments reduces the amount of pneumatic plumbing required 
behind the instrument panel to only those lines connected to the standby airspeed indicator 
and altimeter.  In addition to space saving and easier maintenance, the use of shorter pitot/
static line reduces error-producing acoustic effects.

Terrestrial Magnetism
The Magnet
For thousands of years the oxide of iron called magnetite has been observed to attract small 
pieces of iron.  This property is known as ‘magnetism’.  
Another property for which magnetite was known was its north-seeking capability;  if mounted 
on wood and floated in water it would swing round and align itself in a roughly north-south 
direction, so acting as a primitive compass.  In more recent history it was found that some 
metallic elements and alloys (mainly ‘ferrous’ - iron and steel) could be given these properties, 
bars of such magnetized material being known as ‘magnets’.
Magnetic Field
The field of a magnet is the space around it in which its magnetic influence is felt.  This may be 
illustrated by placing a piece of card over a bar magnet and scattering iron filings on it.  When 
the card is shaken or tapped the filings will take up the field pattern as shown in Figure 9.1.
Figure 9.1 
Poles of a Magnet
From Figure 9.1 it can be seen that the ‘lines of force’ traced by the iron filings converge towards 
small areas near the ends of the magnet. 
 These two areas are called the ‘poles’ of the magnet and are where the properties of magnetism 
are most strongly displayed.  Magnets are made in various shapes but each magnet always has 
two poles.  
A unit pole cannot exist.  If a magnet is cut into two pieces, each piece will have two poles.

Red and Blue Poles
A freely suspended bar magnet (or compass needle) in the earth’s magnetic field will align 
itself roughly north-south.  
The end which points north is known as a  north-seeking or red pole.  The other end is a south-
seeking or blue pole. 
By  convention, magnetic lines of force are directed out from the red pole and back in to the 
blue pole as shown in Figure 9.2.   
Again referring to Figure 9.2, for convenience the magnet has been divided into two halves, 
one half containing the red pole, the other half containing the blue pole.
Figure 9.2  The red and blue poles
Attraction and Repulsion Rules
If two bar magnets are placed in a line, end to end, so that the blue pole of one faces the blue 
pole of the other, a repulsion can be felt.  If both magnets are turned around, so that red pole 
is close to red pole, then again the ends try to move apart.  If, on the other hand, the blue pole 
of one magnet is placed close to the red pole of the other, an attraction is felt.  
The rule is:
Like poles repel each other
Unlike poles attract each other

Methods of Magnetization
Magnetism may be induced in an unmagnetized bar of iron by one of the following methods:
•	 By stroking the bar repeatedly in the same direction with one end of a magnet, a process 
in which the end of the bar last touched by the red end of the magnet is left as a blue pole. 
Figure 9.3 depicts the process and shows the resulting polarity of the iron bar.
Figure 9.3  Making a magnet by stroking
•	 By aligning the iron bar with the lines of force of a magnetic field and subjecting it to 
vibration or hammering.  Such agitation during manufacture (in the earth’s magnetic 
field) is the main cause of aircraft magnetism.  Figure 9.4 shows the polarity of the induced 
magnetism in the iron bar; it is such that there is continuity in the pattern of lines of force, as 
usual directed in to a blue pole, out from a red pole.  The example is analogous to an aircraft 
being manufactured on a northerly heading in the earth’s field and acquiring a permanent 
red pole in the nose and blue pole in the tail.
•	 In the case of iron simply by subjecting to a magnetic field.  The induced polarity is shown 
in Figure 9.4.

Terrestrial Magnetism
•	 By placing the specimen within a solenoid (a cylindrical coil of wire) carrying a direct 
current.  This is the most satisfactory method as the current flowing in the coil produces a 
concentrated magnetic field along the axis of the coil so that a high degree of magnetism 
can be induced in the iron.  (Note that the amount of magnetism which can be induced is 
not unlimited because, at a certain level, the iron becomes magnetically ‘saturated’).  Figure 
9.5. shows the polarity of the magnetism induced in the bar inside the solenoid.  (If the 
current flow were reversed the induced magnetic polarity would be reversed).
Figure 9.5 Magnetization by solenoid
Methods of Demagnetization
Three ways of removing most or all of the magnetism from a magnetized item are listed below.
Shock.  A magnetized bar of iron can be placed at right angles to the earth’s magnetic field 
and hammered.
Heat.  If the specimen is heated to about 900°C, it loses its magnetism and this does not return 
as the specimen cools.
Electric Current.  The component is placed inside a solenoid carrying alternating current, 
the amplitude of which is gradually reduced to zero.  The strong alternating magnetic field 
produced by the alternating current keeps reversing the direction of magnetization (that is 
the polarity of the magnetism) in the specimen.  Not only is the polarity being reversed, but 
the intensity of magnetization is being reduced as the current is reduced.  The specimen’s 
magnetism is very quickly reduced to zero or very nearly zero.
Magnetic and Non-magnetic Materials
Magnetic materials are ‘ferrous’ metals iron and steel, steel being iron alloyed with substances 
such as carbon, cobalt, nickel, chromium, and tungsten.  These metals are called ‘ferromagnetic’ 
and in an aircraft they may be magnetized and produce deviation in the aircraft’s compasses.
Many materials used in aircraft construction are non-magnetic and do not affect the compass. 
Examples of such non-ferrous substances are aluminium, duralumin, brass, copper, plastic and 
paint.

Terrestrial Magnetism
Hard Iron and Soft Iron
Ferromagnetic material can be broadly divided into two classes, hard iron and soft iron.  The 
words hard and soft do not refer to the physical properties of the material but to their magnetic 
characteristics.  
A strong magnetizing field is required to produce magnetic saturation in hard iron.  
Hard iron magnetism is said to be ‘permanent’, meaning that the material, typically steel 
containing cobalt or chromium, remains magnetized for an indefinite period after it has been 
removed from the magnetizing field.  
Such a substance is suitable for permanent magnets.  Soft iron magnetism is called ‘temporary’ 
(or ‘transient’ or ‘induced’) the substance being easy to saturate magnetically with only a weak 
magnetizing field but retaining little or no magnetism when the field is removed.  Nearly pure 
iron behaves in this way.
Some materials exhibit magnetic characteristics which lie somewhere between those of hard 
iron and soft iron.  These substances can be magnetized but this ‘sub-permanent’ magnetism 
is lost partly or wholly over a period of time.

The earth behaves as though a huge permanent magnet were situated near the centre 
producing a magnetic field over the surface. 
Figure 9.6 shows that the poles of this hypothetical earth-magnet do not lie on the earth’s 
spin axis, this lack of symmetry giving rise to magnetic variation.  The magnetic poles are not 
stationary but are currently moving at between 6 and 25 NM per year. The north magnetic 
pole is moving faster than the south magnetic pole. Currently (2015) the north magnetic pole 
is located north of Alaska at 86°N 153°W, and the south magnetic pole is south of Australia at 
64°S 136°E.
Figure 9.6 Earth’s magnetism
Magnetic Variation
The direction of the earth’s field at any given 
point can be indicated by a freely-suspended 
magnet.  Such a magnet will align itself 
roughly in a north-south direction with its red 
pole towards the north magnetic pole.  
The longitudinal axis of the magnet defines 
the direction of the magnet meridian at the 
point.  
The magnetic meridian is the direction of the 
horizontal component of the earth’s field at a 
point on the earth’s surface.  
The angle, measured in the horizontal plane, 
between the magnetic meridian at a point 
and the true meridian at the point is known as the magnetic variation.
Variation is designated west or east depending on whether the magnetic pole lies to the west 
or to the east of true north.

Terrestrial Magnetism
Variation can have any value from zero to 180°, the latter occurring on the true meridian 
linking north geographical with north magnetic pole, similarly in the southern hemisphere.
Magnetic Dip
Except near the ‘magnetic equator’, where the lines of force are parallel to the surface, one 
end of the freely-suspended magnet will dip below the horizontal, pointing to the nearer pole. 
To the north of the magnetic equator, the magnet’s red pole will be lower whereas to the 
south the blue pole will be lower.  The angle, measured in the vertical plane, between the axis 
of the magnet and the horizontal is called the angle of dip.
Fairly closely following the geographical equator (in the main 10° of latitude of it) is the 
‘magnetic equator’, which can be represented on a chart by a line joining points on the earth 
where the angle of dip is zero.  
If the freely-suspended magnet is moved either north or south of the magnetic equator the 
dip gradually increases, reaching about 66° in the United Kingdom.  Over the earth’s magnetic 
poles the dip is 90° and the magnet is then vertical.
Figure 9.8 Resolution of the Earth’s field
Field Strength
The total force T exerted at a point by the earth’s field acts in the direction taken up by a 
freely-suspended magnet influenced only by the earth’s field.  The total force, angle of dip and 
magnetic variation at a point are sometimes known as the ‘magnetic elements’ for that place. 
It is convenient to resolve this total force T into its horizontal and vertical components H and Z 
respectively.  Figure 9.8 demonstrates this resolution.

Directive Force
The horizontal component H of the earth’s field is known as the directive force because it is 
the component which aligns the magnetic compass needle with the magnetic meridian, so 
providing a directional reference.  When either of the earth’s magnetic poles is approached, 
this component approaches zero strength, while the value of Z approaches that of T.  Over the 
pole, with dip 90° and zero directive force H, the magnetic sensor (compass) becomes useless. 
In the region of the magnetic equator the strength of the directive force H approaches the 
value of T, while Z approaches zero as does the angle of dip.
It becomes apparent that the directive force H decreases as the angle of dip increases, and vice 
versa and Figure 9.9 serves to illustrates this.  
In fact, the relationship between H and dip angle is not quite as simple as it appears, because 
of irregularities in the pattern of the earth’s field and variations with position and time of the 
total magnetic force T.  
The strength of the horizontal component H at a latitude about 60°N of the magnetic equator 
is very roughly half the value of H at the magnetic equator.
Figure 9.9 The Effect of Latitude on the Components of Dip
Regular Changes in Earth Magnetism
Secular Change.  The earth’s field not only lacks symmetry but is also subject to several known 
periodic changes.  
Of these, the secular changes are the most significant and are produced by the slow movement 
of the magnetic poles about the geographic poles, the period of this cycle being apparently 
about 960 years.  
The north magnetic pole is moving slowly westward, this wander mainly affecting magnetic 
variation.

Terrestrial Magnetism
In the UK the value of westerly variation is currently decreasing at a rate of 7 minutes per 
annum, and the predicted variation in London in the year 2240 is zero.  
The annual rate of change of variation is shown on navigation charts so that the variation 
printed against the isogonals can be readily up-dated.
Other regular changes occur diurnally, annually, and over an eleven-year period, this latter cycle 
apparently being related to the eleven-year cycle of sunspot activity.  These changes, unlike the 
secular type mentioned earlier, are not of sufficient magnitude to affect normal navigation.
Unpredictable Changes in Earth Magnetism
Magnetic ‘storms’ of varying intensity and lasting for as long as three days occur at irregular 
intervals.  These phenomena appear to be produced by unusually large sunspots.
The main effect of these magnetic storms is a temporary but significant change in magnetic 
variation.  The alteration is unlikely to exceed 2° in the UK but in the Arctic and Antarctic the 
change may exceed 5° and last for as long as an hour.  The value of the directive force H can 
also change and in high latitudes may fall below the minimum required for efficient compass 
operation.

The Direct Indicating Compass
The Magnetic Compass
A compass is an instrument designed to indicate direction on the surface of the earth, relative 
to some known datum. The magnetic compass uses the horizontal component of the earth’s 
field as its directional datum. Unfortunately, the earth’s field is normally not aligned with 
the true meridian - the most desirable datum from which to measure direction. The angular 
difference between true and magnetic meridians is called the magnetic variation discussed in 
the previous chapter.
The purpose of a magnetic ‘steering’ compass in an aircraft is to indicate heading, the direction 
in which the aircraft is pointing.
Magnetic influences - iron/steel components, electric currents - distort the earth’s field so that 
the compass magnet assembly deviates from the magnetic meridian. This is called compass 
deviation.
Direct Indicating Magnetic Compass
This chapter deals with the direct indicating or direct reading magnetic compass, where the 
pilot directly reads his heading in relation to the pivoted magnet assembly.
The basic type of direct reading magnetic compass used in aircraft is the vertical card design.
Figure 10.1 A vertical card compass
The Vertical Card Compass
The vertical card compass - which is also known as the B-type or E-type - is the direct reading 
compass in general use. It is usually the main magnetic heading reference in light aircraft and 
the standby compass in larger aircraft.
It consists of a circular compass card attached directly to the magnet assembly. This combined 
unit is suspended in liquid within the compass bowl. A vertical lubber line on the glass window 
of the bowl enables the heading to be read off the compass card.

Compass Requirements
The direct reading magnetic compass contains a pivoted magnet which must be able to align 
itself, and remain aligned, with the horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field. For the 
compass to succeed certain requirements must be satisfied. The most important of these are 
that the magnet system must be:
•	 Horizontal
•	 Sensitive
•	 Aperiodic
Horizontality
In order to measure direction in the horizontal, the magnets must lie as nearly as possible in the 
horizontal plane during normal straight and level flight. A freely suspended magnet assembly 
would align itself with the earth’s total field so the magnets would only be horizontal at the 
magnetic equator.
To achieve horizontality, the magnet assembly is ‘pendulously suspended’, the centre of 
gravity of this assembly being lower than its supporting pivot, as shown in Figure 10.2.
Figure 10.2 
In this way, the tilting effect caused by the vertical component Z of the earth’s field is opposed 
by the weight of the magnet assembly, this equilibrium being achieved at the cost of only a 
very slight residual tilt of the magnets (north-seeking ends down) - by about 2° in mid-latitudes 
- in the northern hemisphere. (South-seeking end down in the southern hemisphere). Figure 
10.2. shows the two turning couples involved.
One is produced by Z which exerts a downward force on the red (north-seeking) end of the 
compass magnet and an upward force on the blue end.
The other couple is produced by the weight W acting downwards through the centre of gravity 
(displaced because of the tilt) and the reaction R acting upwards through the pivot.

The Direct Indicating Compass
For equilibrium, the magnet takes up the amount of tilt necessary to make the couples balance. 
(A third - very weak - couple produced by the horizontal component, H, of the earth’s field, 
opposing the tilt has been omitted for simplicity).
Sensitivity
The magnet system is required to seek the horizontal component H of the earth’s field in all 
areas except near the magnetic poles - where the horizontal component is inadequate.
The notes on magnetism show that the ability of a pivoted magnet to align itself with an 
external field - its sensitivity - depends on the strength of the external field and on the magnetic 
moment of the magnet. The weak external field (H) at a place cannot be changed, but the 
magnetic moment of the magnet can be increased - by increasing the magnet’s length and/or 
pole strength.
It is, however, undesirable to increase the magnet length so the pole strength is increased by 
using two, four or six short magnets or a circular magnet, made of an alloy which will accept 
and retain the high degree of magnetism required.
Sensitivity is further increased by reducing friction. This is achieved in three ways:
•	 By using an iridium-tipped pivot in a jewelled cup.
•	 By lubricating the pivot with the liquid which fills the compass bowl.
•	 By reducing the effective weight of the magnet assembly acting down through the pivot, 
because the liquid that the magnet assembly is displacing is denser than air.
Aperiodicity
The magnetic assembly is required to be aperiodic or ‘dead beat’, which means that it should 
settle down quickly on a steady indication after being displaced by turbulence or manoeuvres.
Any tendency to oscillate must be quickly ‘damped out’. The desired aperiodicity is achieved 
as follows:
•	 Several short magnets are used instead of one longer one. This keeps the mass of the 
assembly near the centre, so reducing the moment of inertia and consequently making any 
oscillations easier to damp out. Light alloy is utilized wherever possible in order to minimize 
the weight of the assembly framework.
•	 The primary purpose of the liquid in the compass bowl is to act as a damping liquid on 
the compass assembly. The grid ring compass dampens oscillations more rapidly than the 
vertical card compass, due to addition of damping wires. These wires are attached to the 
magnet assembly and also pass through the damping liquid.

The Compass Liquid
The liquid mentioned earlier is essential to the design of the compass. Two difficulties may arise. 
Firstly, the liquid is likely to expand or contract with change of temperature; this is overcome by 
incorporating an expansion chamber or ‘Sylphon tube’.
Secondly, errors occur in sustained turns as a result of ‘liquid swirl’. Liquid swirl occurs due 
to the viscosity of the liquid; because of this the liquid chosen should have a low viscosity to 
minimize liquid swirl. Liquid swirl is discussed later in this chapter.
Various liquids, including alcohol, have been used. The main properties required of a compass 
liquid are:
•	 Low coefficient of expansion
•	 Low viscosity
•	 Transparency
•	 Low freezing point 
•	 High boiling point 
•	 Non-corrosiveness
Deviation
Deviation is produced by the iron/steel components in the aircraft. It is the angle between the 
local magnetic meridian and the direction in which the compass magnets are lying.
Deviation is named easterly (or plus) if the north-seeking (red) ends of the magnets point to 
the east of magnetic north. If the north-seeking ends points to the west of magnetic north, 
deviation is said to be westerly (or minus).
Deviation varies with heading so it has to be measured on a series of different headings. This is 
usually done by conducting a compass swing (which is fully covered in the chapter on aircraft 
magnetism). Once deviation has been reduced as far as possible, the residual deviation is 
recorded on a compass deviation card, which is located in the aircraft.
During the swing, normal flying conditions should be simulated as far as possible, with engines 
running, electrical/radio services switched on, and the aircraft in a level flight attitude.
It is obviously most important that no ferromagnetic objects such as tools, or watches should be 
placed near the compass as this would introduce unknown amounts of deviation. Furthermore, 
ferromagnetic payloads should be stowed as far away from the compass as permissible within 
the loading limits. With exceptionally large ferromagnetic loads, a compass swing may have to 
be carried out before flight with the load aboard.

The Direct Indicating Compass
Acceleration and Turning Errors
Direct reading compasses are subject to large errors during linear acceleration or deceleration, 
or during a turn.
Most manoeuvres which cause the centre of gravity (CG) of the magnet assembly to move 
away from its normal position, almost directly below the pivot, will produce an error.
However, if the manoeuvre displaces the centre of gravity north or south of its usual position so 
that CG and pivot are still in the plane of the magnetic meridian, the magnet assembly merely 
changes its north-south tilt angle, with no rotation in azimuth and consequently no error.
Note also that turning and acceleration errors only occur where there is a significant vertical 
component (Z) in the earth’s field, so that except for a small liquid swirl effect in turns, the 
errors are non-existent near the magnetic equator.
The north-seeking end of the compass magnet should remain pointing in the same direction - 
magnetic north - whether the aircraft is moving in a straight line or turning.
Acceleration and turning errors occur however when the north-seeking end of the magnet 
is displaced from magnetic north and therefore an incorrect heading will be shown on the 
compass card which is attached to the magnet. Figure 10.3 shows a pendulously suspended 
magnet (with residual dip) in the northern hemisphere.
Figure 10.3 A Pendulously Suspended Magnet in the Northern Hemisphere
Note that the vertical line through the pivot point is now closer to the nearer (north) magnetic 
pole than the magnet’s centre of gravity. Consider an aircraft, (and therefore the magnet 
assembly) being accelerated towards the west, as shown in Figure 10.3. The magnet is attached 
to the aircraft at the pivot point. However, while the pivot is being accelerated the magnet’s 
inertia, which acts at the magnet’s centre of gravity, will try to maintain its state of uniform 
motion. The result will be that the magnet will rotate (in this case anticlockwise) and the 
incorrect heading will be shown.

The Direct Indicating Compass
Errors Caused by Linear Acceleration
The size of the acceleration error depends on a number of factors which includes aircraft 
heading. Acceleration / deceleration errors are maximum on East and West (M) headings and 
zero on North and South (M) headings.
The error is caused by inertia acting on a magnet which has residual dip due to the effect of the 
vertical component Z on the magnet.
Acceleration on 270°M (NH)
Figure 10.4 shows an aircraft accelerating on 
a magnetic heading of 270°M in the northern 
hemisphere, such as occurs during take-off 
on runway 27. Since the magnet assembly is 
pendulously suspended, its inertia will cause it 
to swing back behind the pivot point which is 
offset to the north of the magnet’s centre of 
gravity. This displacement enables a turning 
couple produced by the earth’s vertical 
component Z to rotate the magnet assembly 
anticlockwise round the pivot.
The angle measured clockwise from the 
north-seeking end round to the aircraft’s 
nose increases. The compass reading will 
therefore increase, so indicating an apparent 
turn towards north. Thus, according to the 
compass, the aircraft is now heading, say, 
280° whereas its real heading is in fact still 
270° -  the compass is over-reading.
Acceleration on 090°M (NH)
Figure 10.5 shows an aircraft accelerating on 
a magnetic heading of 090°M in the northern 
hemisphere. Since the magnet assembly is 
pendulously suspended, its inertia will cause 
it to swing back behind the pivot point. This 
displacement enables a turning couple to 
rotate the magnet assembly clockwise round 
the pivot. The angle measured clockwise from 
the north-seeking end round to the aircraft’s 
nose reduces. The compass reading will 
therefore decrease, so indicating an apparent 
turn towards north.
Thus, according to the compass, the aircraft 
is now heading, say, 080° whereas its real 
heading is in fact still 090° - the compass is 
under-reading.

Deceleration on 090°M (NH)
Figure 10.6 shows an aircraft decelerating on 
a magnetic heading of 090°M in the northern 
hemisphere.
Since the magnet assembly is pendulously 
suspended, its inertia will cause it to swing 
forwards ahead of the pivot point.
This displacement enables a turning couple 
to rotate the magnet assembly anticlockwise 
round the pivot.
The compass reading will therefore increase, 
so indicating an apparent turn towards 
south. Thus, according to the compass, the 
aircraft is now heading, say, 100° whereas its 
real heading is in fact still 090° - the compass 
is over-reading.
Acceleration on 270°M (SH)
Figure 10.7 shows an aircraft accelerating on a magnetic heading of 270°M in the southern 
hemisphere. The inertia will cause the magnet assembly to swing back behind the pivot point 
which is now offset to the south of the magnet’s centre of gravity. This displacement enables a 
turning couple to rotate the magnet assembly clockwise round the pivot.
Figure 10.7 Acceleration on 270°M  
(Southern hemisphere)
The compass reading will therefore decrease, so indicating an apparent turn towards south. 
Thus, according to the compass, the aircraft is now heading, say 260°, whereas its real heading 
is in fact still 270° - the compass is under-reading.

Acceleration on a Northerly Heading (NH)
Figure 10.8 shows an acceleration on a northerly heading (northern hemisphere).
The CG lags and the north-south tilt of the magnet assembly changes, but the magnets are 
tilting in the vertical plane of the magnetic meridian through the pivot - so no error occurs.
With deceleration on north/south headings there is again no error, only a reduced N/S tilt due 
to the inertial forward swing of the magnet assembly.
Figure 10.8 Acceleration on 360°M  
(Northern hemisphere)
Summary of Acceleration Errors
Acceleration errors are zero on N/S magnetic headings (in both hemispheres), increasing to 
maximum on headings 090°M and 270°M. Acceleration causes an apparent turn towards 
the nearer pole (apparent turn north in the northern hemisphere, apparent turn south in 
the southern hemisphere). Deceleration causes an apparent turn towards the further pole 
(apparent turn south in the northern hemisphere, apparent turn north in the southern 
hemisphere).
Whenever the magnet assembly is displaced clockwise, the readings will decrease and the 
compass will under-read.
Whenever the magnet assembly is displaced anticlockwise, the readings will increase and the 
compass will over-read.
The size of a linear acceleration error depends on the:
•	 heading
•	 magnitude of the acceleration
•	 design of the magnet system
•	 magnetic latitude (which affects the relative strengths of H and Z).
The errors are maximum near the magnetic poles, decreasing to zero at the magnetic equator.

The Direct Indicating Compass
Turning Errors
Turning errors are maximum when turning through north and south, and ignoring liquid swirl 
zero when turning through east and west.
The basic theory of turning errors is much the same as that for linear acceleration errors.
Due to the earth’s vertical component of the magnetic field, Z, the compass’s CG will be 
displaced from almost beneath the pivot point away from the nearer pole. In a turn, the 
aircraft accelerates towards the centre of the turn, and therefore an acceleration force acts 
through the pivot towards the centre of the turn, while the opposing centrifugal force due to 
inertia acts outward through the CG.
This results in the magnet assembly tending to ‘swing out’ from the turn, rotating the magnet 
assembly around the pivot point and producing a turning error.
Turning errors are usually more significant than acceleration errors for the following reasons:-
•	 They are inherently of greater magnitude because greater displacement of the magnet 
assembly is likely in turns.
•	 Turns occur more often and are likely to be more prolonged than linear accelerations.
Turning from 045° to 315° (NH)
Consider an aircraft executing a left-hand 
turn in the northern hemisphere as it passes 
through 000°M.
The magnet’s cg is displaced from beneath 
the pivot point away from the north pole 
due to the vertical component of the earth’s 
magnetic field. Because of inertia the magnet 
assembly will be thrown out of the turn 
rotating the magnet assembly anticlockwise.
If there was no turning error the magnet would 
remain stationary and the aircraft rotate 90° 
around it - resulting in the pilot seeing 90° 
passing beneath the compass’s lubber line.
However, the aircraft is turning port and the 
magnet assembly rotates in the same (anti- 
clockwise) direction.
Although the aircraft has turned 90° around 
the compass, the magnet has been displaced 
and rotated in the same direction by a number of degrees (say 20°). The pilot will therefore 
only see 70° pass beneath the lubber line and the compass is termed sluggish.
Whenever the magnet rotates anticlockwise it will over-read.

The Direct Indicating Compass
This means that if the pilot stops the turn at 315° indicated the actual heading will be 
numerically smaller such as 295° - therefore the turn must be stopped early (such as 335°) to 
achieve the correct heading.
This can also be described as undershooting the required heading (note ‘undershoot’ is 
referring to turning through a smaller angle, and should not be confused with ‘under-read’ 
which means that the numerical heading indicated is too small).
If the pilot deliberately undershoots, rolling out when the compass reads about 335°, he should 
observe, when the wings are levelled, the compass ‘catch up’ and settle on 315°.

through 000°M, the magnet’s CG is displaced 
from beneath the pivot point away from the 
north pole due to the vertical component of 
the earth’s magnetic field.
Because of inertia the magnet assembly will be 
thrown out of the turn rotating the magnet 
assembly clockwise.
Note: The aircraft and the magnet assembly 
are again rotating in the same direction (but 
this time clockwise) and therefore the compass 
will again be sluggish.
Whenever the magnet rotates clockwise it will 
under-read . This means that if the pilot stops 
the turn at 045° indicated the actual heading 
will be numerically larger such as 065°.
Therefore the turn must be stopped early 
(such as 025°), or the pilot should undershoot 
the indication, to achieve the correct heading.
Turning from 135° to 225° (NH)
Now consider an aircraft turning right as 
shown in Figure 10.11 through south in the 
northern hemisphere as it passes through 
180°M, the magnet’s CG is displaced from 
beneath the pivot point away from the nearer 
pole (the north pole) due to the vertical 
component of the earth’s magnetic field.
Because of inertia the magnet assembly will be 
thrown out of the turn rotating the magnet 
assembly anticlockwise.
The aircraft is turning clockwise (right) but the 
magnet assembly is rotating anticlockwise.

Therefore the aircraft and the magnet are now rotating in opposite directions. Although the 
aircraft has turned 90° around the compass, the magnet has been displaced and rotated in 
the opposite direction by a number of degrees (say 20°). The pilot will therefore see 110° pass 
beneath the lubber line and the compass is termed ‘lively’.
Whenever the magnet rotates anticlockwise it will over-read. This means that if the pilot stops 
the turn at 225° indicated the actual heading will be numerically smaller, such as 205°.
Therefore the turn must be stopped late (such as 245°), or the pilot should overshoot, to 
achieve the correct heading.
Turning from 135° to 225° (SH)
Now consider an aircraft turning right as 
shown in Figure 10.12 through south in the 
southern hemisphere as it passes through 
180°M, the magnet’s CG is displaced from 
beneath the pivot point away from the nearer 
pole (the south pole). Because of inertia the 
magnet assembly will be thrown out of the 
turn rotating the magnet assembly clockwise.
The aircraft and the magnet assembly now are 
rotating in the same direction (clockwise) and 
therefore the compass will again be sluggish.
Whenever the magnet rotates clockwise it will 
under-read. This means that if the pilot stops 
the turn at 225° indicated the actual heading 
will be numerically larger such as 245°. 
Therefore the turn must be stopped early 
(such as 205°), or undershoot, to achieve the 
correct heading.
Remember that when the wings are levelled, the compass will ‘catch up’ and settle on 225°.
Turning through East or West
Consider a turning aircraft passing through the magnetic headings of 090° and 270°.
The magnets are not horizontal but their tilt is north-south, that is in the vertical plane of the 
magnetic meridian through the pivot.
There is no rotational couple acting round the pivot, so there is no turning error.
Turning errors are zero when passing through east or west.
Other Notes on Turning Errors
It is easier to steer a southerly rather than a northerly heading in the northern hemisphere, 
firstly because on south the compass does not indicate the wrong direction of turn as it can 
on north, and secondly because the ‘lively’ nature of the indications reduces the risk of over-
correcting small steering errors.

Magnitude of Turning Errors
There are many factors affecting the severity of turning errors. They are worst at high latitudes 
where Z is strong and H is weak.
Other relevant variables include rate of turn, duration of turn, speed of the aircraft, the 
headings involved and the design of the compass.
Turning Errors - Liquid Swirl
The effect known as liquid swirl was mentioned earlier. During a turn, the liquid in contact with 
the inside of the bowl tends to be dragged around with the bowl, so producing in the liquid 
small eddies which drift inwards from the circumference and deflect the magnet assembly in 
the direction of turn. Therefore the liquid tends to swirl - and rotate the magnet assembly with 
it - in the same direction as the aircraft’s turn.
Accordingly, when turning through north in the northern hemisphere it will increase the 
magnitude of the turning error (in which the assembly turns in the same direction as the 
aircraft).
The size of the turning error when turning through south in the northern hemisphere (where 
the assembly turns in the opposite direction to the aircraft) will be reduced.
In the southern hemisphere the swirl effect will be in the opposite sense.
Note: At the magnetic equator where there is no vertical component Z in the earth’s field, liquid 
swirl is the sole source of turning error; with most compasses the effect is only slight.
Summary of Turning Errors
These are maximum when passing through magnetic north or south, decreasing to zero when 
passing through east or west.
The error increases with increase in magnetic latitude.
At the magnetic equator the only turning error is due to liquid swirl.
Whenever the pilot turns through the nearer pole (north in the northern hemisphere, or 
south in the southern hemisphere):
•	 the aircraft and compass rotate in the same direction
•	 the compass will be sluggish
•	 the pilot should undershoot the turn / roll out early
•	 liquid swirl will increase the turning error
Whenever the pilot turns through the further pole (south in the northern hemisphere, or 
north in the southern hemisphere):
•	 the aircraft and compass rotate in the opposite direction
•	 the compass will be lively
•	 the pilot should overshoot the turn / roll out late
•	 liquid swirl will reduce the turning error

At the MAGNETIC EQUATOR, there is NO TURNING ERROR because there is no “dip”. 
Remember, that it is a displacement of the MAGNETS in a CLOCKWISE direction when 
viewed from above which causes the compass to UNDER-READ, and a displacement in an 
ANTICLOCKWISE direction which causes the compass to OVER-READ.

Gyroscopes
The simplest form of gyroscope (or gyro) consists of a rapidly spinning disc (called a rotor). 
Any rapidly spinning symmetrical rotor exhibits gyroscopic properties – even if it has not been 
specifically designed as a gyro.  For instance, the earth acts as a gyro, and so do spinning tops 
and bicycle wheels. Most aircraft gyros are discs between 2 and 5 cm in diameter, spinning at 
speeds between 4000 and 55 000 rpm, depending on their design.
The shaft about which the rotor spins is called the axis.  Gyros are defined in their orientation 
as either horizontal or vertical by reference to the spin axis, not the rotor.
Figure 11.1 Gyro parts and orientation
Gyros have 2 basic properties which make them important as the basis of aircraft attitude and 
direction instruments.  These are rigidity and precession.
Rigidity
Rigidity is the gyro’s property of maintaining its axis in a fixed direction in space unless 
subjected to an external force.  It is caused by the inertia of the spinning mass.
In order for a gyro to be able to maintain a fixed direction, it must be attached to the airframe 
in such a way that the aircraft has freedom to manoeuvre without disturbing the orientation 
of the gyro.  This is achieved by using suspension devices which allow this freedom.  These are 
called gimbals.  Gyros may have one or two gimbals.
Figure 11.2 One gimbal, one degree of freedom
--- Page 144 ---
Gyroscopes

11
Gyroscopes
In Figure 11.2, assume that the aircraft is travelling left to right across the page, i.e. its longitudinal 
axis is also the gyro axis XX (This is not the same thing as the spin axis).  The aircraft is free 
to bank whilst the gyro remains in the same orientation (spin axis horizontal and in a fixed 
direction).  However, if the aircraft were to yaw, the gyro and its gimbal would be forced out 
of its original orientation.
The aircraft is free to pitch or bank without affecting the gyro, but not to yaw.  How we 
describe this depends on the convention being used.  Some references will describe this as a 
‘2-degrees of freedom system’.  
However, the convention used by EASA does not regard the spin axis as a degree of freedom, 
because no measurement can be made in pitch.  
Figure 11.3, right, shows a 2-gimbal system:
In Figure 11.3 the aircraft is free to pitch and 
bank as before but, with the second gimbal, it 
is also free to yaw without disturbing the gyro. 
The definition of rigidity includes the words 
‘fixed direction in space’.  Rigidity (also called 
‘gyroscopic inertia’) is subject to Newton’s 
Laws of Motion, which apply to all of space, 
not just the earth.  In theory, if there were no 
other errors and the gimballing system 
allowed complete freedom, the axis of the 
gyro would point to a fixed point in space (for 
instance, a distant star), irrespective of the 
rotation of the earth or the motion of the 
aircraft over the earth.
Over short periods of time, this difference 
between 
earth 
orientation 
and 
space 
orientation may not be important, particularly 
if it is swamped by mechanical errors or if the 
gyro is maintained by mechanical means to 
some earth reference.  However, it becomes 
important when considering accurate freely-
gimballed gyros over long periods.
On simple aircraft, gyros do not normally 
have more than two gimbals.  In Figure 11.4, 
right, we have an inner and an outer gimbal, 
but the third structure, on the outside of the 
outer gimbal, is the frame.  It is attached to 
the aircraft and moves with the aircraft.

Gyroscopes
Precession
In Figure 11.5, the gyro is rotating clockwise. 
Assume that an upward force (torque) acts on 
the spin axis.  This is the equivalent of the force 
going into the rotor at the 12 o’clock position. 
However, the reaction will not be to make the 
gyro rotate backwards about the horizontal 
axis from the point where the torque is applied. 
Instead, the torque is precessed through 90° in 
the direction of rotation and the rotor moves 
inwards to the page about the vertical axis, 
as though the force had been applied at the 
3 o’clock position to a stationary rotor.
Now we put this situation into a gimballed 
gyro, as in Figure 11.6 below:
In Figure 11.6 the gyro is spinning about its 
spin axis XX.  A small mass M is applied on the 
inner gimbal in line with the XX axis.  The mass 
acts to pull the inner gimbal down, producing 
a torque about the YY axis.  Effectively, this is 
a force being applied to the 6 o’clock position 
of the rotor.
Initially the gyro axis tilts through a small 
angle φ.  The spin axis is no longer pointing to 
the original fixed point in space.  After that, 
no further movement takes place about the 
YY axis.
The torque is then precessed through 90° in 
the direction of the gyro’s rotation.  The rotary 
motion takes place at the 3 o’clock position 
and the spin axis starts to turn at a constant 
velocity about the ZZ axis.
If the torque at M is withdrawn, the precession 
ceases.
If the torque application at M continues and 
remains in the same relative position on the gimbal ring, the gyro spin axis will continue to 
rotate at a constant velocity.

rotation

The Relationship Between Precession and Rigidity
The rigidity of a gyro depends on two properties:
•	 Moment of Inertia (a combination of the mass and the effective radius at which the mass 
operates)
•	 Rotor rpm
Moment of Inertia.  Moment of inertia is a measure of how big and how heavy the gyro is. 
A gyro with a greater radius will have a larger moment of inertia than a smaller one with the 
same mass.  A gyro with a greater mass will have a larger moment of inertia than one of the 
same radius but less mass.
In order to minimize weight (mass) but get a greater moment of inertia, the mass is often 
concentrated at the rim of a gyro.  A bicycle wheel, which uses spokes, is a clear example.
Rotor rpm.  The faster the rotor spins, the greater the gyro’s rigidity.
The rigidity of a gyroscope is increased if the mass is increased, the effective radius at which 
the mass operates is increased, or if the rotor rpm is increased.
The rate of precession is directly proportional to the applied torque but inversely proportional 
to the moment of inertia and the rotor rpm rate.
Effectively, this means that precession and rigidity are opposite characteristics.  If a gyro has a 
lot of rigidity, it will not precess very much.  If it precesses a lot, it cannot be very rigid.

Wander
Despite 
this 
property 
of 
rigidity, the orientation of a 
gyro axis may alter over time. 
Any departure of a gyro axis 
from its original orientation is 
called wander.  Wander may 
be either real or apparent 
(the difference is explained 
below) or a combination of 
both.  Wander is subdivided 
into drift and topple. If the 
gyro axis wanders in the 
horizontal plane, it is called 
drift, either real or apparent 
(Figure 11.7).
If the gyro axis wanders 
in the vertical plane, it is 
called topple, either real or 
apparent (Figure 11.8).
Horizontal axis gyros can both drift and topple – as seen in Figure 11.7 and Figure 11.8.  However, 
vertical axis gyros can only topple.  They can topple either forwards, backwards or sideways, as 
shown in Figure 11.9 – but they cannot drift.

Real and Apparent Wander
As was stated before, gyro 
wander, whether drift or 
topple, can be subdivided into 
real and apparent wander:
Real Wander.  In real wander, the axis of the gyro moves with respect to inertial space.  This 
departure from the original orientation is caused by manufacturing imperfections, such as 
uneven rotor bearing friction, gimbal friction, imbalance in the mass of the rotor and 
unbalanced gimbals.  Real wander can be reduced by higher quality engineering and 
manufacturing.  Depending on the application, the cost of reducing real wander may not be 
justified by the level of accuracy required.  As with instrument error, gyros need to be as 
accurate as the need of the application in use, but over-engineering costs extra money.  Real 
wander can also be known as ‘random’ wander.
Apparent Wander.  However, 
even if all real wander were 
eliminated 
and 
the 
gyro 
remained 
in 
the 
same 
orientation 
in 
space 
(for 
instance, pointing at a distant 
star) the direction indicated 
by a gyro would still change. 
This is because of changes in 
the 
observer’s 
frame 
of 
reference.  One is caused by the rotation of the earth and is called Earth Rate.  The other is 
caused by flight east or west at latitudes other than the equator and is called Transport 
Wander.
Earth Rate.  Imagine an aircraft parked on 
the equator with a gyro axis pointing to true 
north, i.e. aligned with the local meridian.
As the earth rotates from position 1 to position 
2, the gyro axis remains fixed in space and also 
remains aligned with the local meridian.

Gyroscopes
However, at a pole:
At the pole, the gyro remains aligned in space 
but the meridian direction (i.e. the direction of 
local true north) changes as the earth rotates. 
Therefore we get the full earth rate of 15° per 
hour.  For anywhere between the equator and 
the pole:
Earth Rate = 15 × sine latitude °/hour
(The earth rotates one revolution   (360°) in 1 
day (24 hours).  Therefore the earth’s spin rate 
is 15°/hour.  Latitude at the pole is 90° and 
sine 90° =1.  Latitude at the equator is 0°and 
sine 0° = 0).
Whether earth rate is positive or negative 
depends on the earth hemisphere.   In Figure 
11.11, we are in the northern hemisphere. 
At position 1, the aircraft and the gyro are 
both pointing north.  At position 2, the gyro 
remains orientated to the original ‘gyro north’, but the local earth direction of the parked 
aircraft is up the local meridian, i.e. true north.  If the gyro is taken as the datum, the aircraft is 
now on a heading of about 280°.  The gyro heading has appeared to decrease.  We call this a 
negative earth rate and so it has a value of -15 × sine latitude°/hour.
However, suppose the aircraft were parked in the southern hemisphere, as in Figure 11.12 
below.
The earth rotates eastwards.  As seen from 
above the N pole, looking down, (Figure 
11.11) this is anticlockwise.  However, when 
seen from the S pole looking upwards, as in 
Figure 11.12, this is a clockwise rotation.  If 
the aircraft is parked pointing northwards (12 
o’clock in position 1), when the earth rotates, 
the aircraft is now still pointing in a direction 
of true north (outwards from the S pole), 
point about 3 o’clock in the above diagram, 
but if the gyro is taken as the datum the gyro 
heading is about 080°.  The gyro heading has 
appeared to increase.
Therefore: Earth rate is negative in the 
northern hemisphere 	
and: Earth rate is positive in the southern 
hemisphere

Transport Wander.  Although transport 
wander takes place at the same time as earth 
rate, we shall explain them separately for 
simplicity.  So, disregarding earth rate, imagine 
the earth stopped in space, not rotating.
The aircraft flies from Los Angeles to London 
(the red track in Figure 11.13).  The gyro is 
aligned with the local meridian at Los Angeles 
(the local true north).  This is the solid white 
line.  When the aircraft arrives in London, the 
gyro is still aligned with the same direction in 
space (the dotted white line).  However, the 
actual direction of true north from London is 
the line connecting London to the North Pole. 
The difference is the transport wander, which 
is in fact the difference in the alignment of the 
meridians at Los Angleles and London.  
Types of Gyro – by Function
Some gyros measure angles, e.g. 10° of pitch, 5° of bank, 30° of heading change, etc.  These 
are called displacement gyros.  Others measure angular rate, e.g. a turn rate of 3° per second. 
These are called rate gyros.
Displacement gyros have 2 gimbals and 2 degrees of freedom.  Examples are the Directional 
Gyro Indicator (DGI) and the Artificial Horizon.  Rate gyros have one gimbal and one degree 
of freedom and are used in the Rate of Turn Indicator and in yaw dampers.
Displacement gyros can be subdivided into space gyros or tied gyros.  Space gyros have 
gyroscopic inertia with reference to a point in space.  They are free to wander and, if they 
do, nothing corrects them back to their original datum.  Therefore they need to have a rate of 
real wander which is so low that it may be considered negligible for practical purposes.  Space 
gyros need to be very accurate indeed and they are correspondingly expensive.  They are used 
in Inertial Navigation Systems.
With tied gyros, if they wander, they are restored back to some orientation by an external 
force.  Tied gyros are maintained in some particular attitude or direction rather than space.  For 
instance, the directional gyro of a gyro-magnetic compass is slaved to remain oriented to the 
magnetic north.

Gyroscopes
An earth gyro is one which is maintained vertical or horizontal with respect to local gravity. 
The Artificial Horizon is an example.  Earth gyros are a subset of tied gyros.  Therefore, all 
earth gyros are tied gyros, but not all tied gyros are earth gyros.
Types of Gyro – by Construction
Tuned Rotor.  Tuned rotor gyros are the traditional ‘spinning disc’ type.  These are fitted to all 
elementary and most intermediate types of training aircraft.  The basic DGI, Artificial Horizon 
and Turn Meter covered in the next three chapters are all tuned rotors.
Ring Laser Gyros.  Ring laser gyros (RLGs) emerged in the 1980s and are now used in nearly 
all modern airliners.  They work by comparing 2 light paths round a glass prism.  They offer 
greater reliability and accuracy but are more expensive.
Fibre Optic Gyros.   Fibre optic gyros (FOGs) are an extension of the RLG principle.  They have 
only recently become accurate enough for aircraft applications and the Airbus A380 is the first 
commercial aircraft to use them.
Types of Gyro – Suction or Electric Power
Tuned rotor gyros may be either air driven (suction) or electric powered.
For the air driven type, an engine-driven vacuum pump or carburettor venturi pressure (or 
venturi tube on some light aircraft) reduces the pressure in the instrument case so that filtered 
replacement air is sucked in and led through a jet which blows onto ‘buckets’ cut in the 
periphery of the rotor to make it spin – the same principle as a water wheel.
In electric gyros, the rotor is part of an electric motor.
Suction Gyros.  Suction gyros are independent of electric power and so are not affected by 
electrical failure.  But moisture, dust, oil and grit in the airflow block the filter, giving variable 
rotor rpm.  At high altitude, the engine manifold pressure available may be insufficient to 
maintain rotor speed.  Furthermore, any atmospheric impurities which penetrate the filter can 
reduce bearing life and unbalance gimbals, thereby impairing accuracy.
Electric Gyros.  Electric gyros are generally more expensive and heavier than the air driven 
type and they require power supplies.  However, they can be faster and have more moment of 
inertia.  The rotor rpm can be more rapidly achieved and then maintained more accurately.

Gyroscopes
Therefore, on non-electronic training aircraft, the main gyro instruments are usually electric 
powered for greater accuracy whilst the standby instruments are often air driven in order to 
still be available after a power failure.
Alternate Power Sources.  Both types can suffer from failure of power sources.  The electric 
type will have some type of ‘flag’ indicator to show the pilot if this happens so that he can 
select standby power or switch to the standby instrument.  Pneumatically driven gyroscopes 
usually have an air pressure indicator (often called the ‘suction’ gauge) to show failure of the 
vacuum pump.  Some air driven gyroscopes have an alternate power source which is manually 
selected.
Gimbal Lock.  The ultimate case of gimbal interaction is gimbal lock, which occurs if the 
aircraft continues its bank to 90°.  In this case, the inner and the outer gimbal take up the same 
orientation, as shown in Figure 11.14.  The gimbals still give the freedom to continue any roll, 
but one degree of freedom has been lost.  If the pilot were now to pull back on the control 
column (i.e. rotate in the looping plane), the gyro would now be forced out of its orientation. 
This would result in precession of the gyro, probably violently, usually described as ‘toppling’.
Figure 11.14 Gimbal lock
For most unsophisticated aircraft, gimbal lock is a problem and will result in toppling, that is, 
temporary loss of the use of the gyro until it can be re-erected.  For more complex aircraft, 
especially those with aerobatic manoeuvrability, it can be avoided, either by the use of a fourth 
gimbal or by a gimbal flip mechanism.
Gimbal flip incorporates a powerful torque motor.  When the inner and outer gimbals are 
nearing a locked situation, the motor is triggered to rapidly flip the outer gimbal round by 
180°, thereby restoring freedom.  
One of the biggest limitations of Direct Indicating Magnetic Compasses is their susceptibility 
to turning and acceleration errors.  Using a more stable datum than a light compass needle or 
magnetic assembly would reduce or eliminate these.  What is required is a datum which has 
rigidity in space (the property of pointing in a specific direction, once set up) and which is 
stable enough not to be disturbed by the effects of aircraft manoeuvres.  A gyroscope provides 
this.

Directional Gyro Indicator (DGI)
Introduction
The directional gyro indicator (DGI), often called the ‘direction indicator’ (DI) provides a 
stable directional reference in azimuth for maintaining accurate headings and for executing 
precise turns.  There is no magnetic element in the DI, so it is not north-seeking and must 
initially be synchronized with the magnetic compass.  The synchronization must be checked at 
regular intervals because of real and apparent gyro wander (drift).  The DGI does not therefore 
replace the compass; its stable, dead-beat indications are complementary to the north-seeking 
capability of the compass.  Having no magnetic element, the DGI does not suffer from the 
compass turning and acceleration errors produced by the vertical component of the earth’s 
magnetic field.
Figure 12.1 Two directional gyro indicators
        Vertical Display (Old)
                           Horizontal Display (Modern)
The Principle and Construction of the DGI
The DI employs a tied gyro, that is to say, a gyro having freedom of movement in three planes 
mutually at right angles but with the rotor axis maintained in the yawing plane of the aircraft. 
This means that the rotor axis is horizontal in level flight, and because of gyroscopic rigidity it 
provides the datum from which heading can be measured.
The rotor is mounted in the inner gimbal (on bearings mounted in the outer gimbal) which 
has restricted freedom to turn. The outer gimbal can rotate through 360° about the aircraft’s 
vertical axis, on bearings in the case.

Figure 12.2 An air driven directional gyro
Note that the rotor axis, the inner gimbal axis, and the outer gimbal axis are mutually at right 
angles.
During a turn, the aircraft and instrument case turn on the vertical axis bearings of the outer 
gimbal whilst the gyro rotor, gimbals and indicating scale all remain fixed in azimuth because 
of gyroscopic rigidity.
Heading is indicated on the scale by a lubber line painted on a glass window in the instrument 
case.  Some designs have a circular vertical-card indicating scale geared to the outer gimbal, in 
place of the cylindrical scale fixed to the outer gimbal in the earlier type shown in Figure 12.1.
The Control System - Suction Gyros
With earlier designs of DGI, the rotor is driven by twin jets of air applied from the outer gimbal 
ring.  Suction is applied to the case of the instrument, and replacement air enters the case 
through a filter and is ducted to the jets on the outer gimbal which act on ‘buckets’ cut in the 
rotor.
The jets not only spin the rotor but also serve to maintain or tie the rotor axis in the yawing 
plane of the aircraft.
The rotor axis is lying in the yawing plane and therefore at right angles to the outer gimbal axis, 
the full force ‘X’ of the jets being used to drive the rotor (Figure 12.3).  If the aircraft banks, 
gyroscopic rigidity keeps the rotor axis fixed in space and it is therefore no longer in the yawing 
plane.
The outer gimbal axis is no longer at right angles to the rotor axis, so the jet driving force ‘X’ 
acts at an angle to the plane of the rotor.

Directional Gyro Indicator (DGI)
This force can now be resolved into two components, component ‘Y’ in the plane of rotation 
maintaining the spin of the rotor, and component ‘Z’ acting at 90° to the plane of rotation 
(Figure 12.4).
Because this is a gyro, the component ‘Z’ will precess the rotor as if the force had been applied 
at a point 90° around the circumference of the rotor in the direction of its spin.
The result will be as though a force ‘Q’ (Figure 12.4) was operating to re-erect the rotor with 
its axis in the yawing plane.  If the heading is such that the rotor axis is aligned with the 
longitudinal axis of the aircraft, the application of bank alone (with no turn) will not displace 
the rotor axis from the yawing plane.  This aspect is mentioned again in the paragraph on 
limitations.
Figure 12.3 Rotor axis in yawing plane
Figure 12.4 Rotor axis displaced
A second control system, which is usually combined with the above system  works as follows: 
The jet of air spins the rotor and then flows round the outside of the rotor inside a metal case, 
as shown in Figure 12.5.
The air leaving the case is directed at a wedge plate fixed to the outer gimbal.  When the gyro 
is correctly erected, this ‘exhaust’ jet is divided by the wedge plate into two equal streams 
producing equal reactions on the outer gimbal (R1 & R2).  As soon as the rotor axis is displaced 
from the yawing plane the streams become unbalanced (Figure 12.6) and the reactions on the 
outer gimbal at the wedge plate also become unequal.
The resultant of these reactions applies a torque to the outer gimbal about the vertical axis of 
the gyro.  This torque is instantaneously transmitted by the outer gimbal to the inner gimbal 
and is represented by force ‘F’ in Figure 12.6. This makes the rotor and inner gimbal precess.

Thus an effective force ‘P’ acts to re-erect the rotor axis back into the yawing plane.  If the 
gyro was displaced so far that the jet was nowhere near the wedge plate, then the first system 
would restore the gyro to its correct position.
The jet provides coarse adjustment and the wedge plate fine adjustment.
The Caging Device
On the front of the instrument (see Figure 12.2) there is a caging knob which, when pushed in, 
moves a caging arm which locks the inner gimbal at right angles to the outer gimbal so locking 
the rotor axis in the yawing plane.  At the same time a gear engages with the outer gimbal 
so that by turning the knob the gyro can be rotated and the scale reading synchronized with 
(usually) the compass reading.
The caging device is designed as described in order that:
•	 The DGI can be synchronized with the compass and reset as required.
•	 The gyro will not topple during synchronization.
•	 Toppling and possible damage to the instrument can be prevented by caging before 
manoeuvres in which pitch and roll limits may be exceeded.
•	 The gyro can be instantly re-erected and re-synchronized if it has toppled.
DGI Limitations
If the aircraft exceeds the pitch or roll limits of 85° (55° in air driven gyro DIs) the gyro will 
topple as the inner gimbal comes up against the stops, the precession causing the outer gimbal 
and scale to spin rapidly.  Exceptions to this can occur:
If the rotor axis is athwartships - 360° of aircraft rotation in the looping plane then being 
possible without toppling the gyro.
If the rotor axis is fore and aft - 360° of roll then being possible without toppling.
The actual indications on the scale at which these two situations can arise depend on the 
vintage and manufacture of the instrument.
DGI Errors
There are several reasons why it is virtually impossible for a DGI to remain synchronized with the 
compass. The most significant errors are listed below and dealt with in subsequent paragraphs.
•	 Gimballing errors.
•	 Random wander.
•	 Apparent wander due to earth’s rotation.
•	 Errors resulting from varying rotor rpm.
•	 Apparent wander due to change of aircraft position (transport wander).

Directional Gyro Indicator (DGI)
Gimballing Errors
These are errors in the indications of the DGI which occur when bank is applied.  If the errors 
during a 360° turn are plotted, an approximate double sine curve results, with zero error on 
four headings (90° apart) spaced between alternate positive and negative peaks (two of 
each).  The curve becomes more complex if pitch changes are made during the turn.  The actual 
readings on the DI at which the maximum errors occur depend on its make and mark.
The errors are small, provided deviations in attitude from the level position are only moderate, 
and they disappear as soon as level flight is resumed.  They occur because of the geometry of 
the gimbal system, in that unless the instrument case (and the aircraft bolted to it) are able to 
rotate about one of the axes of the gyro, the outer gimbal itself must move - giving an error - if 
the rotor axis is to maintain its fixed direction.
Random Wander
The gyro rotor axis may change its direction in space (real wander) or appear to change its 
direction (apparent wander) or suffer from both.
More details of real wander, which is mainly  the ‘random wander’ due to manufacturing 
imperfections, are given in the chapter entitled ‘Gyroscopes’.  In the case of the DGI, gyroscopic 
rigidity is high and random wander (or drift) rates are low.
An air driven type with the rotor spinning at 10 000 rpm has a drift rate of about 1.6°/hour. A 
later design with rpm of 20 000 has a quoted drift rate of 1.2°/hour.
Lower rates of only a few degrees per hour are possible with electrically driven indicators. The 
random wander rates with gyroscopes used in inertial navigation systems may be less than 
0.01°/hour.
Apparent Wander (Due to Rotation of the Earth)
The apparent wander (or drift) of an azimuth gyro has already been mentioned briefly in the 
chapter on gyroscopes.  It is now necessary to consider the magnitude of this wander.
An azimuth gyro (with the axis of the spinning rotor horizontal) is set up in gimbals and frame 
at the North (or South) Pole.  The rotor axis will stay rigid in space (assuming zero real wander) 
while the earth rotates under it through 360° in one day or 360/24 = 15° in one hour.
An observer standing still watching the gyro will move (with the earth) once round it in 24 
hours (See Figure 12.7).
If the gyro is the DGI, its reading will be decreasing (at the North Pole) at a rate of 15°/hour. 
At the South Pole the reading would increase at the same rate.  This is the maximum rate of 
apparent wander due to the earth’s rotation.
Figure 12.8 shows a gyroscope set  up on the ground at the equator with the axis horizontal and 
aligned north/south.  In 24 hours, the observer and gyro will move with the earth once round 
the earth’s axis of rotation.  There is no change in the direction of the rotor axis relative to the 
meridian, so there is zero apparent drift. The apparent drift rate due to the earth’s rotation is 
therefore a function of latitude, being maximum at the pole and zero at the equator.

Figure 12.9 demonstrates how the apparent drift due to the earth’s rotation causes the reading 
of a DI to decrease in the northern hemisphere.
At A, an observer looking north at the DGI reads 360°.  When the observer and his gyro have 
rotated with the earth to B, the observer will see a value some degrees west of north (a DGI 
reading of less than 360°) because gyroscopic rigidity is keeping the gyro rotor axis aligned 
with a fixed direction in space.
The rotor axis cannot remain aligned N/S with the meridian because the latter, except at the 
equator, is continually changing its direction in space - its spatial orientation - as the earth 
rotates.
As the observer and gyro continue to rotate with the earth, the readings will decrease further. 
Similarly, it can be seen that if an observer and gyro located in the southern hemisphere rotate 
with the earth from E, the readings of the DGI will increase.
Figure 12.11 shows graphically the variation of apparent drift with latitude. The drift rate is 
proportional  to  the  sine of the latitude, so that assuming there is zero random drift and no 
compensation has been made:-
Apparent drift rate = 15 × sin lat (degrees per hour)
Note that this can only be correct if the gyro is ‘stationary’, meaning that it is not being moved 
or ‘transported’ from one place to another.

Latitude Nut Correction
Compensation for apparent wander (drift) due to the rotation of the earth is by means of an 
adjustable latitude rider nut on a threaded stud fixed horizontally to the inner gimbal.
In its central position (Figure 12.12) the effect of the nut is cancelled by a counter-balance 
weight on the opposite side of the gimbal.
Screwed out a few turns, the nut applies a downward moment on the gimbal.  This force, with 
the usual precession rule applied, produces (viewed from above) an anticlockwise precession 
of the gyro, including its scale, in azimuth.  This would cause the reading in the window to 
increase.
Conversely, if the nut is wound in,  clockwise precession occurs, making the readings decrease. 
Apparent drift due to the rotation of the earth can therefore be cancelled for a given latitude 
by using the latitude nut to produce an equal and opposite real drift.  The ability to screw the 
nut in or out enables compensation to be made for increasing readings (southern hemisphere) 
or decreasing readings (northern hemisphere).
Figure 12.12 Compensation for Apparent Wander
The setting can only be changed under workshop conditions (not in the aircraft) so that 
compensation will only be correct for the chosen latitude.  However, errors due to latitude 
changes are usually small compared with random wander errors of the DI.
Should the aircraft be moved to a new operating area involving a latitude change of the order 
of 60°, a DGI with the appropriate latitude correction would probably be substituted.

Figure 12.13 illustrates graphically the effect of compensating a gyro for the apparent drift of 
minus 13°/h  at 60°N (15 sin 60°).
The latitude nut introduces a real drift of plus 13°/h so that the resultant drift (assuming no 
random error) will be zero at 60°N.  It will be realized that the compensation of +13°/h applied 
for 60°N will now be present at all latitudes, and this is represented in the graph by renumbering 
the drift scale.
The drift in the region of 60°N is negligible after compensation but if the aircraft is now moved 
to an area south of the equator the drift values will be greater than if no compensation had 
been made (as a study of Figure 12.13 will show).
Figure 12.13 Gyro Corrected for 60°N
Summarizing:
Flight north from the ‘corrected latitude’ gives a decreasing reading (a minus drift rate). 
Flight south from the ‘corrected latitude’ gives an increasing reading (a plus drift rate). 
Flight away from the ‘corrected latitude’ results in the drift rate increasing.
Flight towards the ‘corrected latitude’ results in the drift rate decreasing.

Effect of Change of Aircraft Latitude on Compensated DGI
It has already been stated that the apparent drift rate due to the earth’s rotation varies with 
the sine of the latitude (Figure 12.11).
If we consider an aircraft tracking due north, starting from the equator, the initial apparent 
drift rate of an uncorrected gyro is zero.  As the flight progresses, the reading of the DGI 
decreases. By the time the aircraft reaches 30°N, the DGI reading is decreasing at a rate of 
7½°/h, and at 60°N it is decreasing at 13°/h.  It should be clear that in flight due north or south 
from the equator at constant ground speed the value of the apparent drift rate will increase 
from zero to a value of 15 sin lat °/h at the pole.  The rate of increase of drift rate will not be 
linear - because of the sine function.  The same applies if a compensated gyro is transported 
north or south of its latitude of correction. 
Errors Due to Unstable Rotor rpm
Since the rate of precession of a gyro depends on rotor rpm, over which no precise control is 
maintained in a suction-driven DGI, the latitude nut compensation is only approximate.
For instance, at high altitude with inadequate suction, the rotor rpm will be lower than the 
design value.  This results in reduced gyroscopic rigidity and the latitude nut produces too high 
a precession rate, so over-correcting the apparent drift.  Should rpm exceed the design figure, 
which is less likely to occur, the rigidity would increase and the latitude nut would produce a 
lower rate of precession so under-correcting the apparent drift.
Transport Wander 
At any latitude other than the equator, meridians (which define local north) are not parallel. If 
the gyro is aligned to one meridian, then flown east to west, the new meridian will be inclined 
to the old by transport wander.
Drift Rate Calculations
Example 1
An aircraft is stationary at 60°N.  Calculate the hourly wander rate, for an uncompensated gyro.
Solution 1
Apparent wander   =  -15 × sin 60°(decreasing)°/h   =   - 12.99°/h

The Artificial Horizon
The Artificial Horizon Introduction
The artificial horizon (AH) provides the pilot with information in terms of the aircraft’s attitude 
both in pitch and roll.  It is a primary instrument, replacing the natural horizon in poor visibility. 
The attitude display consists of a miniature aircraft shape or ‘gull-wing’ (tail view) painted or 
engraved centrally on the inside of the glass face of the instrument, and therefore fixed to the 
instrument case and the actual aircraft.  Behind this representation of the aircraft is the horizon 
bar, linked to the gyro in such a way that the bar is gyro-stabilized parallel to the true horizon. 
The artificial horizon may be suction or electrically driven. It is also known as a gyro horizon 
and attitude indicator.
Construction
The artificial horizon uses an earth gyro in which the spin axis is maintained in, or tied to, the 
vertical by earth’s gravity. This means that the plane of the rotor rotation is horizontal, so 
providing the stable lateral and longitudinal references required.
Figure 13.1 
Artificial Horizon Indications
Figure 13.1 shows the three axes of the gyro: XX, YY and ZZ.  Because the gyro is tied to the 
vertical, note that the axis XX (the spin axis) will remain earth vertical and therefore the axis 
YY will be earth horizontal when the aircraft is straight and level.

Figure 13.2 A nose-up attitude
Pitch
Figure 13.1 shows the level-flight attitude display and two views of the instrument with the 
case removed.
In Figure 13.2 a nose-up attitude (of 10 degrees) is shown. The pitch-up movement has rotated 
the case together with the attached outer gimbal ring about the lateral axis YY.  As this occurs, 
a guide pin protruding from the stabilized inner gimbal forces the horizon bar arm down.  The 
horizon bar is now below the gull-wing producing the nose-up indication.  (Figure 13.5 shows 
the gimbal rings and the pitch-indication linkage in greater detail)  The three views in Figure 
13.3 relate to a pitch-down situation.  Note that the angle of pitch may be selected using the 
pitch markers shown.
Roll
In roll, as with pitch, the rigidity of the vertical gyro provides the stable attitude reference. As 
the aircraft rolls (about the longitudinal axis - ZZ in the diagrams) the instrument case and the 
gull-wing will rotate about the stabilised gyro rotor and gimbal system.
The gyroscopic rigidity of the spinning rotor holds the horizon bar in the rolling plane so that 
the amount and direction of bank are displayed by the gull-wing relative to the horizon bar. 
A more accurate indication of the amount of bank is given by a pointer attached to the outer 
gimbal and showing bank angle on a scale painted on the face of the instrument.

The Artificial Horizon
Limitations
The amount the case can move relative to the gyro is controlled by fixed stops.  With older 
designs, typical limits are ± 60° in pitch and 110° each way in roll.  In modern instruments 
there is complete freedom in roll and up to 85° (plus or minus) in pitch.  If the limits are 
exceeded, the gyro ‘topples’, giving violent and erratic movements of the horizon bar.  Unless 
a fast erection system is incorporated, accurate indications will not be obtained until the gyro 
has re-erected itself over a period of 10 to 15 minutes.
Control Systems
The rotor assembly is made very slightly bottom-heavy in order to keep down the time taken 
for initial erection when the gyro is first started up, but a complex control system is required to 
maintain the rotor axis vertical in flight. A suction or air driven artificial horizon exhausts air 
through four slots which are normally half covered by four pendulous vanes.  Electric artificial 
horizons use levelling / mercury switches and torque motors.
Figure 13.5 The air driven artificial horizon
The Air Driven Artificial Horizon
In the air driven artificial horizon an engine-driven suction pump (or venturi tube in some 
light aircraft) is used to create a suction of about 4 inches of mercury in the instrument case. 
Replacement air, drawn in by this suction via a filter, is ducted through the outer and inner 
gimbals to enter the rotor case as a jet which spins the rotor at up to 15 000 rpm.  After driving 
the rotor, the air passes into the instrument case through slots at the base of the rotor housing.
Control System
The control system of the air driven artificial horizon consists of four slots and four pendulous 
(hanging) vanes at the base of the rotor housing. The vanes hang down so that when the rotor 
axis is vertical each slot is half covered by its vane, and four equal jets of air emerge from the 
slots, fore an aft and left and right, as in Figure 13.6. Because the four jets are of equal strength 
but in opposite directions no force is exerted on the gyro and therefore no precession occurs - 
the gyro rotor remaining vertical.

Figure 13.6 Equilibrium
However, the opposing vanes are fixed to a common spindle so that the four vanes operate as 
two pairs.  The positioning of the vanes is such that if the rotor axis wanders from the vertical, 
one vane will hang clear of its slot, allowing unrestricted  airflow, while the opposite slot is 
completely obstructed by its vane.  The resulting unbalanced airflow precesses the gyro and 
corrects the tilt, returning the gyro axis to the vertical. Exactly how this correction is achieved 
is shown in Figure 13.7.
The gyro has wandered from the vertical so that vanes A and C are not affected and remain 
half covering their slots. However, vanes B and D, on a common spindle, hang down so that slot 
B is now closed and D is wide open. A strong jet exits through D causing an equal and opposite 
reaction ‘R’ on the gyro. This reaction is precessed through 90° in the direction of rotor spin 
(anticlockwise when viewed from the top) and acts in the direction of ‘P’ which restores the 
gyro axis to the vertical.

Acceleration Error in the Air Driven Artificial Horizon
The control system of the air driven artificial horizon depends on the pendulous vanes being 
affected by the earth’s gravity. However, the vanes will be affected by any acceleration, not 
just that due to gravity.
When an aircraft accelerates in a level attitude (such as during the take-off run) a false nose-
up, right wing down, or  climbing right hand turn indication will result.  The pitch error is due 
to the effect of acceleration on the lateral pendulous vanes.  The roll error is due to the inertia 
of the bottom-heavy rotor housing.  These effects are now considered in more depth.
•	 Pitch Error. During acceleration, the lateral vanes lag, swinging back towards the pilot, 
opening the starboard slot and closing the port slot.  This results in a reaction ‘R’ which acts 
to port (see Figure 13.8).  By the rule of precession the effect on the gyro is as if the direction 
of application of R had been moved 90° in the direction of rotor spin (anticlockwise).  The 
gyro will now be precessed out of vertical with the base moving backwards towards the 
pilot. As shown in Figure 13.8, this movement is transmitted via the guide pin and horizon 
bar arm to bring the horizon bar below the gull-wing giving a nose-up indication.

The Artificial Horizon
•	 Roll Error.  Due to inertia, the weighted base of the rotor housing tries to lag during 
acceleration.  However, this force will be precessed, resulting in the base of the rotor housing 
moving to starboard and the gyro axis precessing out of the vertical (see Figure 13.9). This 
rotates the whole rotor / gimbal assembly about the longitudinal axis to give a right wing 
down indication.
Figure 13.9 Roll Error Due to Acceleration
Deceleration will cause a nose-down, left wing low error, the opposite of the acceleration error 
indication.  These errors assume that the rotor is rotating anticlockwise when viewed from the 
top, which is the case for British air driven artificial horizons.  Most electric horizons and some 
American air driven horizons have clockwise rotor spin, giving opposite errors.

The Artificial Horizon
Turning Errors in the Air Driven Artificial Horizon
Whenever an  aircraft turns there must be an acceleration  towards the centre of the turn 
(centripetal force).  Since the pendulous vanes are now affected by a horizontal acceleration as 
well as acceleration due to gravity, errors in pitch and roll indications will occur.  During the 
turns the centrifugal force will act on the fore and aft pendulous vanes (‘erection’ error) and 
weighted base of the rotor housing (‘pendulosity’ error).  The errors are complex and change 
as the turn progresses, cancelling out after a 360° turn.  The magnitude of the errors varies 
with speed, rate of turn and type of horizon.  For a chosen speed and rate of turn, the errors 
can be compensated for by tilting the top of the rotor axis slightly forward (for erection error) 
and slightly to the left (for pendulosity error).
However, in an uncorrected instrument the following errors will occur. (Assume a classic 
instrument  - air driven with the gyro rotating anticlockwise when viewed from above).

The tilts are of the order of 2°.  The setting of the horizon bar has to be similarly modified to 
indicate correctly in level flight.  Small residual errors occur, particularly if the speed and rate 
of turn are not those for which compensation has been applied, but the errors are very much 
smaller than they would be had no compensation been made.
Rigidity
High rotor speeds in suction horizons of up to 15 000 rpm result in high gyroscopic inertia. 
With electric horizons, speeds of 22 500 rpm are typical giving even greater rigidity.  Because 
of the high inertia, precession rates are low and therefore once a horizon topples it will take a 
significant period for re-erection unless a rapid erection device is fitted.
Serviceability Checks
Before Flight.  Check that the horizon bar takes up a laterally level position with the correct 
pitch indication for the aircraft type, and that this indication is maintained when taxiing.  If a 
caging device is fitted, the instrument should be uncaged at least five minutes before take-off 
to ensure that the rotor axis has had time to reach alignment with the true vertical.
In Flight.  The artificial horizon should give an immediate and correct indication of any change 
in pitch or roll attitude.

The Electric Artificial Horizon
The main advantage of an electrical artificial horizon over the air driven horizon is its greater 
rigidity due to its faster spin rate.  This greater rigidity results in increased accuracy due to 
reduced errors.  The basic principle of the instrument is the same as the air driven horizon. 
The vertical gyro is still tied by earth’s gravity, but by mercury / levelling switches and torque 
motors rather than the pendulous vanes of the air driven horizon.
Electric Artificial Horizon Control System
The gravity-operated control system consists of mercury / levelling switches (which are fixed to 
the base of the rotor) and electric torque motors.  If a levelling switch is not level, the mercury 
liquid ball moves from its central position and closes the circuit to drive its torque motor.  The 
torque motor provides the force which is precessed to return the gyro axis to the vertical. 
There are two levelling switches, one to sense pitch and one to sense roll.
They activate the pitch and roll torque motors respectively which precess the gyro back to the 
vertical as soon as it starts to wander.
Figure 13.10 The Electric Horizon Control System
Because of the 90° precession rule, the torque motor on the side of the inner gimbal corrects 
wander in the rolling plane (applying torque round the lateral axis to produce rotation about 
the longitudinal axis).  Likewise the pitch torque motor is on the outer (longitudinal) gimbal so 
that the precession is about the lateral axis to correct for pitch.
This control system, like that of the suction horizon, is designed to compensate for turning 
errors by maintaining the rotor axis slightly tilted away from the true vertical and having the 
horizon bar compensated by a similar amount.  The amount and direction of this tilt depends 
on the particular model of instrument in use.

The Artificial Horizon
Acceleration Errors in the Electric Horizon
Acceleration errors are minimal in the electric artificial horizon for the following reasons:
•	 The high rotor speed of an electric artificial horizon results in very high gyro rigidity and 
therefore very low precession rates. There is therefore less potential for the gyro to move 
out of the earth’s vertical.
•	 The rotor housing is less bottom heavy in the electric artificial horizon and therefore roll 
error is reduced while accelerating.
•	 Pitch and roll cut-out switches. When an aircraft in a level attitude accelerates the pitch 
levelling switch will falsely complete the circuit as the mercury ‘ball’ moves back in its tube 
(due to inertia). As this would then result in the pitch torque motor falsely precessing the 
gyro out of the vertical, a pitch cut-out switch is included in the circuit which activates when 
an acceleration of 0.18g or greater is detected.
Similarly in a turn the roll mercury switch would falsely activate the roll torque motor. A cut-
out is therefore incorporated in the circuit which is activated at 10 degrees angle of bank.
Fast Erection System
In many electric horizons a fast erect system is included to give rapid initial erection and quick 
re-erection should the instrument topple due to exceeding the operating limits.  Quoting typical 
figures, the normal erection rate of 4° per minute is increased to 120° per minute by pushing 
the fast erection knob on the face of the instrument.  This action increases the voltage to the 
erection torque motors.  One of the advantages of having a fast erection system is that the 
pendulosity (bottom-heaviness) of the  gyro can be reduced, so decreasing the turning and 
acceleration errors.
Note:  When airborne, the fast erection knob can only be used successfully in level flight with 
no acceleration.  During acceleration or a turn, the liquid level switches would be ‘off-centre’, 
and operation of the fast-erection system would align the rotor axis with a false vertical.
Adjustable Aeroplane Datum
This is a refinement found on some American artificial horizons.  The idea is that if when 
an aircraft is trimmed out to fly straight and level it has a pitch up attitude, the ‘aeroplane’ 
datum can be adjusted to lie on the horizon.  However, there is a risk that such adjustment in 
flight could result in a misleading datum for flying approach procedures in IMC conditions. The 
Aeronautical Information Circular 14/1969 discusses this risk in depth, and strongly recommends 
that in light aircraft the datum be set before flight and thereafter left well alone.  EASA 
require that such movable datums be removed or otherwise rendered inoperative on aircraft 
having a maximum all-up weight in excess of 6000 pounds (2727 kg).
Vertical Gyro Unit
This unit performs the same functions as the gyro horizon, i.e. it establishes a stabilized 
reference about the pitch and roll axes of an aircraft. It is sometimes referred to as a remote 
vertical gyro, or occasionally a vertically axised data generation unit.

The Turn and Slip Indicator
The Rate of Turn Indicator
This instrument incorporates two measuring devices, both indicating on the same instrument 
face. One of these, the rate of turn indicator, (commonly shortened to ‘turn’ indicator), uses 
a rate gyro to measure rate of turn about a vertical axis.  The other, the slip indicator, is a 
very simple pendulous device which is used mainly to show whether or not a turn is balanced, 
(whether the angle of bank is correct for the TAS and rate of turn), and if not, to indicate the 
extent of slip or skid.
The Rate Gyro
The turn indicator is based on a horizontal-axis rate gyro, which has only one gimbal and 
therefore only one degree of freedom.  If the aircraft banks (without turning) the gyro axis 
has the freedom to remain horizontal.  However, if the aircraft yaws, the frame, fixed to the 
airframe, applies a force (labelled primary torque in Figure 14.1), in a direction where the gyro 
is not gimballed, and therefore has no freedom.  This results in a precession which will cause 
the gyro to depart from the horizontal.  A spring system prevents the gyro from turning all the 
way to the vertical, and the amount of spring stretch is a measure of the rate of turn.
Operation
Figure 14.1and Figure 14.2 illustrate the principal of operation.  If the aircraft turns, the rotor 
is subjected to a primary torque acting about the ZZ axis. This produces a primary precession 
about the YY axis, the direction of this precession being as if the applied force were moved 90° 
in the direction of rotor spin.  As the rotor tilts about the YY axis it causes a spring between 
gimbal and frame to be extended.  The resultant spring tension subjects the rotor to a secondary 
torque acting about the YY axis.  This secondary torque, with the precession, will continue until 
the gimbal has tilted just the right amount to give the spring tension required to generate a 
rate of secondary precession equal to the rate of turn of the aircraft.  This gives  equilibrium.  It 
should be emphasized that the chain of events is virtually instantaneous - as the aircraft goes 
into a turn, the gimbal takes up the appropriate angle of tilt.
Figure 14.1 
Figure 14.2 
If the rate of turn changes, the tilt of the gimbal will also change, to re-establish the balance of 
torques on the gyro.  The angle of tilt is thus a measure of the rate of turn.  A pointer fixed to 
or linked with the gimbal indicates the tilt on a scale on the face of the instrument.  The scale 
is calibrated to indicate rates of turn either side of the centre zero so that the first graduation 
corresponds to a Rate 1 turn with the aircraft turning 3° per second.

The Turn and Slip Indicator

The Turn and Slip Indicator
A second mark for rate 2 corresponds to 6° per second. There may be further graduations for 
higher rates of turn.
Calibration of correct rate of turn (the spring tension) is optimized for a design TAS.  
However, only a small amount of error is introduced, even for quite large departures from 
design TAS.
In practice the errors produced by TAS deviations are not serious.  One manufacturer quotes 
a maximum error of 5% over a speed range of 85 to 350 knots, the calibration value being 
260 knots.
Constructional Details
Suction and electrically-driven types are available.  With the former, an engine-driven pump 
or venturi tube is used to apply suction to the case.  Replacement air enters via a filter and 
is directed by a jet at the ‘buckets’ cut in the  periphery of the rotor.  The rotor rpm are low 
compared with those of the DGI and artificial  horizon.  This is because the gyroscopic property 
of precession is used to measure rate to turn, so that a high gyroscopic rigidity is undesirable. A 
damping system fitted to the gimbal reduces oscillation.  This may be the piston-in-cylinder type 
or an electromagnetic device.  Stops limit the movement of the gimbal to tilt corresponding to 
a turn of about 20° per second.
Note  
As there is only one gimbal, the gyro will not ‘topple’ when it comes against the stops.
Effect of Varying Rotor Speed
If the suction is inadequate (at high altitude, or with a choked filter, or a leaking suction tube) 
with an air driven instrument, gyro rigidity will be lowered as the gyro is “underspeeding”. 
Consequently the secondary precession needed to equal the aircraft turn can be generated by 
a smaller secondary torque.  This reduced torque will be produced by a smaller angle of gimbal 
tilt, and this means that the instrument will under-read the turn rate.
Alternatively, if the gyro were to “overspeed”, by the same token it will over-read the rate of 
turn that is being achieved by the angle of bank applied.
Errors in the Looping Plane
In a gently banked turn, the aircraft is turning mainly in the yawing plane, but in a steep turn 
there is more movement in the looping plane.  Normally movement in the looping plane means 
that the aircraft is rotating about the rotor axis, with no effect on the gyro.  However, if the 
gimbal is tilted before movement in the looping plane commences, as happens with a yaw, the 
movement in the looping plane will cause additional precession of the rotor.
The usual positive movement in the looping plane in a steep turn will increase the gimbal tilt 
causing the indicator to over-read, sometimes coming against the stops.

The Turn and Slip Indicator
The Slip Indicator
It is desirable that turns should be properly balanced, with no side slip or skid.  This implies 
that the angle of bank should be correct for the TAS and rate of turn.  The correct bank angle 
could be accurately calculated, or rules of thumb may be used.  For instance, with rate 1 turns, 
we can take one tenth of the TAS and add seven to give approximately the required bank 
angle.  For example; rate 1, TAS 150 knots; bank angle should be 15 + 7 = 22°.  This rule gives 
reasonable accuracy for rate 1 turns with TAS between 100 and 250 knots.  During instrument 
flight however, the fewer the calculations that have to be made, the better.  The slip indicator 
gives a direct indication of the state of balance of the turn.
Construction
Early types of slip indicator employed a simple metal pendulum suspended in the instrument 
case, its oscillations being controlled by a piston-in-cylinder damping device.  The modern 
version is usually a ‘ball-in-tube inclinometer’.  This comprises a solid ball in a curved tube 
containing liquid with damps out the unwanted oscillations.  It is sketched in Figure 14.4. and 
Figure 14.6. The heavy ball behaves like a pendulum, with the centre of curvature of the tube 
acting as the effective point of suspension.
Operating Principles
Consider first the aircraft in level flight with lift L balancing weight W viewed in Figure 14.3. 
The weight W of the ball in the tube acts downwards and is exactly balanced by the equal and 
opposite reaction of the base of the tube on the ball, acting upwards towards the centre of 
curvature of the tube.  If the wings are level, the ball will lie just between the two vertical lines 
etched on the tube, as indicated in Figure 14.4.

Figure 14.4 Ball-in-tube (Level Flight)

The Turn and Slip Indicator
Now let us consider a balanced turn to the left.  Figure 14.5 shows the aircraft with lift L equal 
and opposite to the resultant of aircraft weight W and centrifugal force C, the latter being 
proportional to TAS and rate of turn.
The ball is also subject to a centrifugal force depending on TAS and rate of turn, so it rolls 
outwards, taking up a new equilibrium position such that the reaction of the base of the tube 
on the ball is again exactly balanced, this time by the resultant of ball weight W and centrifugal 
force C (Figure 14.6)
Because both aircraft and the ball are experiencing the same TAS and rate of turn (and so the 
same acceleration towards the centre of the turn) it can be proved that the resultant weight 
and centrifugal force for the aircraft will be parallel to the resultant of weight and centrifugal 
force for the ball.  Now if the ball is laterally central in the tube, (between the two etched lines), 
the resultant and reaction forces of the ball must lie in the aircraft’s vertical (see Figure 14.6). 
These forces are parallel, as stated above, to the resultant of aircraft weight and centrifugal 
force with must therefore also lie in the aircraft’s vertical and will thus be in the same line as 
the lift L (Figure 14.5) - which means that the turn is balanced.
Figure 14.5 Balanced Turn To Port  
Figure 14.6 Balanced Turn To Port  
Unbalanced turns are most simply considered as follows.  Let us assume that the TAS and rate 
of turn are the same as in Figure 14.5 and Figure 14.6, so that the ball will not have moved 
laterally. Now if too much bank is applied, (for the TAS and rate of turn), the tube will have 
been rotated too far in the rolling plane so that the ball appears as in Figure 14.7, no longer 
central, but correctly indicating the aircraft to be ‘slipping in’ to the turn, the radius of which 
will be less than it should be.  If on the other hand insufficient bank has been applied, the 
instrument will be indicating that the aircraft is ‘skidding out’ of the turn (see Figure 14.8), the 
radius of turn this time being greater than it should be.

Flying at 360 kt each minute you will fly 6 NM and so.......... in 2 minutes you will cover 
12 NM.
2.	
The circumference of a circle =  × d (diameter of the circle)
3.	
The circumference is 12 NM, therefore

The Turn Co-ordinator
Turn Co-ordinator
The Turn Co-ordinator is an interesting development of the Turn and Bank indicators.
The primary difference is in the setting of the precession axis of the rate gyroscope and the 
method of display.
The gyroscope is spring restrained and is mounted so that the axis is at about 30 degrees with 
respect to the aircraft longitudinal axis, thus making the gyroscope sensitive to banking of the 
aircraft as well as to turning.
A turn is normally initiated by banking the aircraft, the gyroscope will precess, and this in turn 
will move the aircraft symbol in indicate the direction of bank and enable the pilot to anticipate 
the resulting turn.
The pilot then controls the turn at the required rate by alignment of the aircraft with the 
graduations on the instrument dial.  The rate of turn will depend on the instrument in use 
either as a rate one turn, 3 degrees per second, or any other rate dependent on instrument 
design.  The ball still has to remain central for a balanced rate of turn.
The annotation “No Pitch Information” on the indicator scale is given to avoid any confusion in 
pitch control which might result with the similarity with the presentation of the gyro horizon.

Deviation
The compass needle would accurately define the magnetic meridian were it not for the aircraft’s 
own internal magnetism deflecting it. Deviation is the angular difference measured between 
the direction  taken up by a compass needle and the magnetic meridian. Deviation is named 
easterly or westerly depending on whether the north-seeking end of the compass needle lies 
to the east or west of the magnetic meridian.

Compass Swing
The basic method of determining deviation is to compare the aircraft’s heading compass 
reading with magnetic heading as defined by a high quality ‘land or datum’ compass.  This 
comparison of aircraft compass and magnetic datum readings is carried out in an area selected 
specifically for this purpose.
Therefore the aims of a compass swing are as follows:
•	 To observe / determine the deviations / differences between magnetic north (observed on 
a landing compass) and compass north (observed in the aircraft) on a series of headings
•	 To correct / remove as much deviation as possible
•	 To record the residual deviation which is left after the compass has been adjusted
The magnetic deviation observed during a compass swing can be said to be derived from hard 
iron and soft iron magnetism and this total field can in turn, for our purposes, be later resolved 
into two further combined components (coefficients B and C).

Hard Iron Magnetism
The total force at the compass position 
produced by permanent hard iron magnetism 
can be resolved into three components.  These 
components will be fixed for a given aircraft 
and will not change with change of heading.
Soft Iron Magnetism
Soft iron magnetism is induced in parts of the 
aircraft structure by surrounding fields - the 
most important of these being the earth. 
The earth’s field has a vertical  as  well  as 
horizontal component.  However, again for 
our purposes we will within the constraints 
of the syllabus only consider vertical soft iron 
(VSI) magnetism (Z is the vertical component 
of the earth’s field and H is the horizontal 
component).  The component Z has an 
increasing effect with latitude as the compass 
magnets try to follow  the earth’s flux lines 
therefore VSI magnetism must also vary with 
latitude. However,  Z is zero at the equator, 
where the horizontal component H is greatest, 
so no VSI magnetism is induced there.
When we examine the effective positioning 
of the imaginary magnets found when 
completing a compass swing we must 
remember that we use a real system (the 
compass) to give us aircraft heading and that 
this read-out is affected by these magnetic 
forces which we have gone to some trouble 
to discover.
We can see from Figure 16.3  that the 
positioning can vary, (even  to  the  extent  of 
having  two  imaginary magnets affecting our 
compass) but the effect will be easily resolved 
by the compass swing which can cater for any 
positioning as long as we follow the basic 
rules.
For example we may examine the case where 
the effect of the blue pole is said to be in the 
nose or forward of the aircraft compass.

Aircraft Magnetism
Heading north the isolated blue pole is in the same horizontal 
direction as the earth’s blue pole and so the needle is not 
deviated. The directive force or alignment of the earth’s field  is 
being augmented by the blue pole, effectively they are pulling 
together.
As the aircraft now turns right on to 045°, deviation begins 
to take place and by 090° this has become maximum. It then 
starts to become less as we approach 180°.	
 
Remember that the blue pole represents a magnetic force which 
on this heading acts along the same line but in opposition to 
the stronger earth’s field.
On the remaining headings 180° to 360° the effects of the blue 
pole in the nose are as expected i.e. the red end of the compass 
needle is being attracted to the west of magnetic north giving 
the maximum westerly deviation on 270°.
If the deviations caused by the blue pole in the 
nose are plotted against compass heading, 
a positive sine curve is obtained.  Had the 
blue pole been aft of the compass a negative 
sine curve would have been obtained.  This 
would mean that on a heading of 090° the 
deviation would reach a maximum westerly 
value instead of a maximum easterly value. 
The changes in directive force would also be 
revised, the maximum occurring on 180° and 
the minimum on 360°.

Equally we should be able to  see that if a further magnetic source is resolved to the right wing 
we would achieve a positive cosine curve along the same lines.
Correction of Coefficients
The principle for correcting coefficients is the same for any system and can be summed up as 
follows:
Coefficient A - a mechanical problem of a displaced lubber line corrected by loosening the bolts 
holding the compass body or in the case of the RIMC the detector unit and carefully turning it 
until the correct heading is in place.
Coefficient B - correction required because of magnetic deviating forces acting upon the DRMC 
or the detector unit and giving errors known as deviation. Firstly calculate the error to be 
removed or more correctly the heading you wish to make the compass read and this will be 
done on an easterly or westerly heading.
Coefficient C - correction required because of magnetic deviating forces acting upon the DRMC 
or the detector unit and giving errors known as deviation. Firstly calculate the error to be 
removed or more correctly the heading you wish to make the compass read and this will be 
done on a northerly or southerly heading.
We can see that the correction for B and C are very similar but that we must remember to 
apply the sign of the correction properly to ensure an accurate correction to our compass 
system. When the compass swing is completed we of course have to check our work and this 
‘check swing’ is carried out using eight or perhaps twelve points of the compass to allow us 
to derive a compass card that will be placed in the aircraft. This compass card indicates to us 
the residual deviations that we have been unable to resolve within the essentially horizontal 
procedure.  Alternatively, the Residual Deviations affecting the compass after the completion 
of a compass swing may be shown by the use of a graphical table or a curve constructed from 
the information obtained. Either set of calculations will allow for the placing of a Compass 
Deviation Card near to the compass in the aircraft.
Accuracy Limits
In accordance with CS OPS-1 (European Regulations) the aircraft’s compasses must, after 
correction, be within the following limits:
	
	
Direct Reading Magnetic Compass	
+/- 10°
	
	
Remote Indicating Compass	 	
+/- 1°

Limitations of the Direct Reading Compass
The Direct Reading Compass has three major limitations:
•	 Turning and acceleration errors.  The compass cannot be read accurately during a turn.
•	 The magnetic sensing element (the magnets on the vertical card) is contained within the 
instrument and is therefore situated close to the pilot so that the card can be seen.  The 
cockpit area is close to sources of deviation, such as electric lights, electric motors and 
ferrous metal.
•	 The instrument is self-contained.  It is not possible to take a magnetic heading and input 
it into other equipment.
Limitations of the Directional Gyro Indicator
The Directional Gyro Indicator attempts to solve some of these problems by use of an air 
driven or an electromechanical gyro.  Turning and acceleration errors are eliminated and an 
output can be taken to other equipment.  However, there is no magnetic input, so if the gyro 
drifts with time there is no correction except by the pilot manually synchronizing to the direct 
reading compass at regular intervals.
Requirement for the Gyro-magnetic Compass
What is required is a system which combines the best of both. The short-term rigidity of the 
gyro overcomes turning and acceleration errors.  This needs to be combined with the longer-
term monitoring of the earth’s magnetic field so that if the gyro starts to drift, a servo system 
slaves it to alignment with a magnetic input.  Such a system is a gyro-magnetic compass.
The gyro-magnetic compass is known by several names.  It can be referred to as the:
•	 Gyro-magnetic Compass.  
•	 Remote Indicating Compass.
•	 Slaved Gyro Compass.
They all mean the same thing.
Basic System Description
At its simplest, the system comprises the following elements:
•	 Magnetic Detector Unit.  This is also often known as a flux valve or a flux detector.
•	 Heading Indicator.  This is what most people refer to as ‘the compass’.
•	 Precession Amplifier.  This may also be known as a slaving amplifier.
•	 Precession Motor.  This may also be known as a slaving or synchronizing motor.
•	 Horizontal Gyro.
In simple systems, the horizontal gyro is directly connected to the compass card of the heading 
indicator via a bevel gear and a drive shaft.  This is assumed in the description which follows.

Operation with Steady Heading – Correction for Gyro Drift
This description assumes a steady heading, which gives a steady input from the detector unit 
(flux valve), and assumes that the compass has already been synchronized.  Any difference 
between the flux valve field and the gyro alignment would only arise if the gyro were to drift. 
•	 The detector unit (flux valve) senses the earth’s magnetic field and reproduces it within the 
compass unit, where it is compared with the position of the gyro drive shaft (which also 
positions the compass card indicator – the indication of heading to the pilot).  
•	 If the two are aligned, no further action takes place. The compass card is reading the right 
heading.  If, however, the gyro starts to drift, the drive shaft will not be in alignment with the 
flux valve field, and an AC error signal is generated and  passed to the precession amplifier 
(marked with a big A in Figure 17.1), where it is amplified, phase detected, and rectified to 
DC.   
•	 The DC signal drives the precession motor, which turns the gyro.  This gyro output is fed via 
the direct drive shaft to the heading indicator for comparison with the flux valve signal.  
•	 If the two are aligned, the compass is synchronized and no further action takes place.   If 
not, the error correction continues until the compass is synchronized.

Remote Indicating Magnetic Compass
It would be possible to cut out the gyro, in theory.  The flux valve field could be passed for 
comparison with the compass card and the error signal passed to a motor which would 
directly drive the compass card shaft.  This would still give an electromagnetic compass, with a 
detector unit remote from the major source of deviations, and its output could be used to drive 
other systems.  However, such a system would be overly responsive to any fluctuations in the 
field detected by the flux valve and would suffer significantly from turning and acceleration 
errors.  The use of the gyro gives stability and rigidity because the precession motor applies 
corrections to the drive shaft at the rate of approximately only 3° per minute.
Operation in a Turn – Gyro Drift Small Over Period of Turn
Now consider what happens in a turn.  We will assume, initially, that the gyro does not drift 
during the turn, which is not unreasonable, because even during a full 360° orbit, the turn 
will only take 2 minutes.  The aircraft turns, but the gyro, having rigidity, does not.  This gives 
relative rotation between the horizontal gyro and the instrument case and so operation of 
the bevel gear causes the direct drive shaft to rotate, changing the heading indication on the 
compass card.  However, at the same time, the heading sensed by the flux valve, which is being 
passed to the driveshaft for comparison, is changing at the same rate.  Therefore no error 
signal is generated and the compass should remain synchronized during the turn.
If there is some gyro drift during the turn, on completion of the turn there will be a small error 
signal.  This will be taken out as described in the previous paragraph.
Rapid Synchronization
When the gyro is started up on initial switch-on, the alignment it adopts is random and is 
unlikely to be in synchronization with the earth’s magnetic field.  Therefore an error signal is 
detected at the gyro drive shaft.  The problem is that the precession motor’s normal correction 
rate is only 3° per minute and if the gyro happened to be 90° out, it would take 30 minutes to 
synchronize, which is obviously unacceptable.
The solution is to have a rapid synchronization facility, which can either be a mechanical clutch 
operated by the pilot (as in the DGI) or, in later compasses, a high gain mode for the precession 
amplifier (similar in principle to rapid erection in the electric artificial horizon).  This is operated 
by a 2 position switch, spring-loaded to the normal position, which has to be held against the 
spring for rapid alignment.  Operation of this switch increases the precession motor’s correction 
rate so that synchronization takes only a few seconds.

Detector Unit (Flux Valve)
Figure 17.2 A magnetic detector unit
The detector unit is positioned in a part of the aircraft least affected by on-board electrical 
fields (usually the wing tip or tail fin, where any aircraft generated magnetic disturbances are 
at a minimum).  Its function is to sense the direction of the earth’s magnetic field. It contains 
a pendulous magnetic detecting element mounted on a Hooke’s Joint which enables the 
detector to swing within limits of 25° about the pitch and roll axes, but allows no rotation 
in azimuth. The unit itself is contained in a sealed case partially filled with oil to dampen any 
oscillations created during flight. 
Figure 17.3 Flux valve components
The circular plate is screwed to the underside of the wing.  The black hemisphere protrudes out 
into the airflow and is simply a protective cover for the flux valve inside.  The cable carrying the 
signals passes along inside the structure of the wing.
The primary component is the flux valve, a 3-spoked device, fixed in azimuth but with some 
freedom in the vertical to allow alignment with the plane of the earth’s magnetic field.  Parts 
of the flux valve are shown in Figure 17.3.

The parts in red in Figure 17.3 are shown in isolation in Figure 17.4  below.  All 3 legs are shown 
together, as in the actual unit:
Figure 17.4 Three flux valve legs
The curved ‘rams’ horns’ at the end of each of the 3 legs are simply to improve magnetic flux 
gathering efficiency, but they do not affect the principle  The flux valve would detect even 
without them.  To explain how the flux valve works, we will start by considering just a single 
leg (without the ‘rams’ horns’).
Figure 17.5 A single leg of a flux valve
A simplified diagram of a flux valve leg is shown here.  Alternating current is fed to the coil 
wound around the centre post which in turn produces fields of opposite sign in the top and 
bottom legs of the flux valve.

Figure 17.6  Flux fields at A and B and resultant
The magnetic flux (a measure of the density of 
the lines of force) in legs A and B is shown in 
Figure 17.6 as red and blue lines.    They are at 
the same frequency and amplitude, but are in 
anti-phase.  If we add the components A and 
B together, the resultant flux (the green line) 
is therefore zero, and so no current is induced 
in the pick-off coil.
If the flux produced by the earth’s magnetic 
field were present as a background, the 
positive and negative flux would start from a 
different baseline, which would not be zero. 
This is shown in Figure 17.7.
However, the physical characteristics of the 
metal used in the flux valve legs are such that 
they magnetically saturate at a certain level. 
The metal will not magnetize further beyond 
a certain point.  In this case, the saturation 
curve tops-out at a limiting saturation level, 
giving the response shown (the upper end of 
the blue and red lines).
When we add the flux level together to see 
the resultant, the total flux follows the path 
of the green line.
The operation of the flux valve is in accordance with Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic 
Induction:
	
‘If the number of lines of force threading a circuit is changing, an induced electromotive 
force (EMF) will be set up in the circuit, the magnitude of the EMF being proportional to 
the rate of change in the number of lines of force threading the circuit’

Therefore the secondary winding (the one coloured red in Figure 17.4) will pick up change in 
magnetic flux density (the dips in the green line) as an EMF.  This will be detected as an AC 
signal.
Figure 17.9 shows that if the flux valve leg is in line with the earth’s field, then the EMF induced 
will be at a maximum value.  The secondary winding (which is aligned with the leg) is shown 
in the diagram.  If the flux valve leg is at right angles to the field, then the EMF induced will 
be zero.
Figure 17.9 Effect of earth’s field on different directions 
of flux valve leg
Figure 17.9 shows that the EMF induced varies as the cosine of the magnetic direction of the 
flux valve leg.  Unfortunately, this cannot be transformed directly into heading because, except 
for 0° and 180°, there are 2 possible values of heading for each value of voltage.  Furthermore, 
any slight change of input voltage would give an altered value of output voltage, resulting in 
a different measured heading.
Instead, the 3-leg system shown in Figure 17.4 
is used and the output from each leg is fed to 
one of the 3 legs of a stator.  This re-creates 
the earth’s field relative to the direction of the 
flux valve as shown in Figure 17.10, around the 
direct drive shaft from the gyro to the heading 
indicator compass card.

Error Signal Comparison
Earlier we said that if there were any difference between the gyro shaft alignment and the 
magnetic field detected by the flux valve, an error signal would be generated which would be 
amplified to precess the gyro so that it takes up the alignment of the magnetic heading.  This 
error signal detection is achieved by rotor-stator comparison.
A wound coil is mounted on the gyro drive shaft.  This coil is known as a rotor.  If the coil is in 
line with the AC field generated by the stators, a secondary AC voltage will be induced in the 
rotor (similar to the situation shown in Figure 17.9).  If the rotor is at 90° to the AC field, no 
secondary voltage is induced.  This is known as the null position.  At any position other than 
the null, some secondary voltage is induced.  This secondary induced voltage is passed to the 
precession amplifier where it is amplified, phase detected and rectified to DC.
	
Amplified.  The reason for the amplification is that the un-amplified error signal is not 
powerful enough to drive the precession motor.
	
Phase Detected.  It is important that the precession motor ‘knows which way to turn’. 
Suppose that the gyro shaft is misaligned 2° clockwise from the null.  The motor should 
rotate the shaft 2° anticlockwise, not all the way round 358° clockwise. Otherwise, the 
system would go into continuous rotation.  The purpose of phase detection is to detect 
the sense of the error.
	
Rectified.  The mechanism of the precession motor is an electromagnetic solenoid acting 
on a permanent magnet.  This requires DC. The amplified AC is therefore rectified to 
DC which, depending on the phase detected, will either be in a positive or a negative 
direction, turning the shaft either clockwise or anticlockwise for the shortest route for 
error correction.
Heading Indicator
The heading indicator dial (compass card) is directly driven by the shaft from the gyro.  The 
compass card rotates as heading changes and the heading is read against the index line in the 
12 o’clock position (the lubber line).

A desired heading can be selected by the pilot by rotating the heading selector control.  The 
heading select marker (usually called a ‘bug’) indicates the selected heading.  If the magnetic 
input from the flux valve fails, a warning is given in the form of a heading warning flag. 
Operation as a DGI
If the magnetic input from the flux valve should fail or if it becomes unreliable due to proximity 
to one of the earth’s magnetic poles, it is possible to operate the gyro-magnetic compass in 
gyro mode only, in which case it acts as a DGI and will need to be re-set periodically to a 
directional reference such as a standby compass or other source of aircraft heading.  When it 
operates as a DGI, this is referred to as FREE mode, whilst its normal magnetically monitored 
operation is referred to as SLAVED mode.
Figure 17.12 shows a typical modern compass 
controller.  With the FREE/SLAVE switch at 
SLAVE, the compass operates as previously 
described, with the gyro slaved (in the long 
term) to the input from the flux valve.  If the 
switch is moved to FREE, the magnetic signal 
from the flux valve is disconnected, the rotor/
stator comparison ceases, and the gyro is no 
longer tied in azimuth and so acts as a free 
gyro (DGI).
When the Heading Indicator in FREE the pilot adjusts the indicated heading in order to correct 
it to an external datum heading by use of the CCW/CW (counter-clockwise/clockwise) control 
switch, which is spring-loaded to the central position.
Annunciator
During 
normal 
flight 
in 
SLAVE mode there is usually 
continuous slight motion due 
to oscillations of heading and 
to vibration which means 
that rotor/stator comparison 
of the magnetic flux valve 
signal 
against 
the 
gyro 
shaft position continuously 
generates very small error 
signals.  The error signal and 
therefore 
the 
precession 
amplifier are continuously 
‘hunting’.  This is normal, and 
is how the system is designed 
to work.  
These 
error 
signals 
pass 
through an indicator on their 
way from the amplifier to the precession motor.  This indicator is called an annunciator and an 
example is shown in Figure 17.12.

The annunciator is useful to the pilot for 2 main reasons:
•	 It is an indication that magnetic monitoring of the gyro is taking place.  It shows that the 
compass is ‘synchronized’.
•	 On systems where it is necessary for the pilot to synchronize manually, it indicates which 
way to turn the compass.
Keeping the Gyro Axis Horizontal
Gyro wander can take 2 forms - drift and topple.  The tendency to drift is overcome, as already 
described, by slaving the gyro to the flux valve output, thereby making it a tied gyro in azimuth.
However, the gyro would still topple, over a period of time, unless prevented from doing so.  It 
therefore needs to be tied, either to the aircraft yaw axis, or to gravity in order to keep it erect.
Both the yaw axis and the vertical as defined by gravity have been used as the datum in various 
models of compass.  Both systems use a levelling switch and a torque motor.  
To tie the gyro to the yaw axis, the inner and outer gimbals are maintained at 90° to each 
other by a system of commutators, insulating strips and brushes.  To tie the gyro to the vertical, 
mercury gravity switches are used.  Either way, the correcting signals are passed to a torque 
motor which applies a rotational force to the gyro in the yaw axis.  The resulting precession 
causes the gyro to return to the horizontal, but at a slow precession rate, so that it does not 
react wildly to temporary departures from the horizontal such as turns, accelerations, climbs 
and descents.
Transmitting Heading Output to Other Instruments
One of the advantages of the gyro-magnetic compass over the simple direct reading compass is 
the facility to electrically transmit heading information to use as an input into other instruments. 
The information is picked off from the drive shaft between the gyro and the compass card.  The 
transmitting and receiving device is called a Selsyn Unit.

Remote Indicating Magnetic Compass
The rotor of the transmitter (shown in Figure 17.14) is attached to the heading drive shaft and 
rotates with it.  The orientation of the rotor is therefore the heading which is to be transmitted. 
The rotor is supplied with a constant primary excitation AC voltage, which induces a field in 
the stators.  The stators are directly connected by 3-strand wire to the 3 stator arms of the 
repeater, so an identical field is reproduced there.
If the rotor of the repeater is not perpendicular to the field in the repeater stators, an AC 
voltage will be induced in this repeater rotor.  This is passed to an amplifier and then to a motor 
to turn a shaft on which the repeater rotor is mounted.  The repeater shaft will turn until no 
further voltage is detected.  The repeater shaft therefore follows any heading changes in the 
main gyro drive shaft.
Summary
The gyro-magnetic compass system overcomes the weaknesses of the direct reading compass 
(turning and acceleration errors, magnetic element close to source of deviations, no feed to 
other equipments) and of the directional gyro (no magnetic monitoring).   
The gyro-magnetic compass system combines the short term stability of a gyroscope with the 
long term directional stability of the earth’s magnetism.

Inertial Navigation Systems
Introduction
The fundamental element of this complex system is the Inertial Sensor System (ISS).  To make 
up this system we have a stable platform consisting of high quality gyros and accelerometers 
and a computer.
The purpose of the computer is to integrate the accelerometer outputs with time to give velocity 
and then integrate velocity with time to give distance travelled. From this is available pitch and 
roll attitude, true heading, true track, drift, present position in latitude and longitude, ground 
speed and wind. To change all this information from ISS to Inertial Navigation System (INS) 
we have a further computer which allows us to inject and store waypoints and then compute 
track angle error, distance and time to go to reach them. This information can be used by the 
autopilot, flight director or for normal manual flying of the aircraft.
The modern INS was the first self-contained single source of all navigation data; now joined 
by the similar IRS, laser gyro system which will be discussed later.  The current state-of-the-art 
engineering has enabled production of INS with performance, size and weight characteristics 
which far exceed other older navigation systems.

Basic Principles of INS
Newton’s laws of motion state:
•	 A body continues in a state of rest, or uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is acted 
upon by an external force.
•	 The acceleration - rate of change of velocity - of a body is directly proportional to the force 
acting on the body and is inversely proportional to the mass of the body.
•	 To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Einstein however, in 1905, totally destroyed the premise of absolute motion.  The substance 
of his new theory was that nothing is at rest and that the term at rest meant merely that the 
object under observation was moving at the same velocity as some other object, its co-ordinate 
system and the observer.
The primary measuring device in an INS, the accelerometer, demonstrates this theory for it 
makes no distinction between at rest and any other fixed velocity.  It does, however, make 
distinction between truly fixed velocities and those which we may regard as fixed, but are 
really fixed speeds along curved paths.
Accelerometer and Integrators
Two 
accelerometers 
are 
mounted at the heart of 
the inertial system. These 
acceleration   measuring 
devices sense any change 
in 
the 
aircraft’s 
velocity 
either as an acceleration or 
deceleration very accurately.
One of the accelerometers 
measures 
the 
aircraft‘s 
acceleration in the north-
south 
direction 
and 
the 
second 
in 
the 
east-west 
direction.
The accelerometer is basically 
a pendulous device. When the aircraft accelerates, the pendulum, due to inertia, swings off the 
null position.  A signal pick-off device tells how far the pendulum is off the null position.  The 
signal from this pick-off device is sent to an amplifier and current from the amplifier is sent back 
into a torque motor located in the accelerometer.  A torque is generated which will restore 
the pendulum to the null position.  The amount of current that is going into the torquer is a 
function of the acceleration which the device is experiencing.
The accelerometers would be mounted on a platform; there would be two, one in the north-
south direction, the other in the east-west direction (often a third accelerometer is fitted to 
measure vertical acceleration).

Figure 18.4 Accelerometers
The acceleration signal from the amplifier is also sent to an integrator which is a time 
multiplication device. It starts out with acceleration which is in feet per second squared.  In the 
integrator, it is literally multiplied by time and the result is a velocity in feet per second.

It is then sent through a second integrator, and again, it is just a time multiplier.  With an input 
of feet per second which is multiplied by time, the result is a distance in feet or nautical miles.

Figure 18.7 
The computer associated with the inertial system knows the latitude and longitude of the take-
off point and calculates that the aircraft has travelled so far in the north direction and so far in 
an east direction.  The computer can then compute the new position of the aircraft and give a 
digital read-out which we should note is to tenths of a minute.
In 
like 
manner 
using 
stored velocity and present 
positions 
the 
system 
is 
able to calculate additional 
navigation data and display 
it as requested by the 
operator. The information is 
chosen for display through 
the rotary switch at the 
bottom left of the control 
unit; the information that 
may be obtained will be 
described in full later.

Gravity Effects on Accelerometer
Normally the accelerometer is part of the gyro stabilized platform, but if it was hard mounted 
to the aircraft it could suffer problems in the pitch and roll planes.
The fact that the device has been tilted makes the pendulum swing away from the null position 
through the effects of gravity.
If this were to take place it would obviously output an erroneous acceleration signal which 
would in turn result in an erroneous velocity and distance travelled.  Therefore, if we allow this 
there will be a false acceleration problem caused by the pitch or roll angle.  If the accelerometer 
was kept earth horizontal this would not happen and no error would occur.

The Integrating Gyroscope
An integrating gyroscope used in INSs is a one degree of freedom gyro using viscous rather 
than mechanical (spring) restraint as seen in the more commonly found rate gyroscope
Figure 18.10 shows a simple rate-integrating gyro.  It is basically a can within which another can 
(the inner gimbal) is pivoted about its vertical axis.  The outer can (frame) is filled with a viscous 
fluid which supports the weight of the inner gimbal so reducing bearing torques.

Inertial Navigation Systems
The Platform
To keep the accelerometer level, it is mounted on a gimbal assembly, commonly called the 
platform.  The platform is nothing more than a mechanical device which allows the aircraft to 
go through any attitude change and yet the very inner element of the platform on which the 
accelerometers are mounted is able to stay earth level.  Gyroscopes which are used to stabilize 
the platform are also mounted on the inner-most element of the platform. They provide inputs 
to amplifiers and motors which control the gimbals and keep the accelerometers level.
Figure 18.11 The platform
The gyro and the accelerometer are mounted on a common gimbal.  When this gimbal tips 
off the level position, the spin axis of the gyro will remain fixed.  The case of the gyro, then, 
is moved off level and the amount that the case is tipped will be detected by the signal pick- 
off in the gyro.  That signal is then amplified and sent to a gimbal drive motor which restores 
the gimbal to the level position again.  Since the accelerometer is always kept level, it does 
not sense a component of gravity and is able to sense only the horizontal accelerations of the 
aircraft as it travels across the surface of the earth.
In reality, three integrating gyros are mounted on the inertial platform, with their input axis 
mutually perpendicular.  Three gimbal motors drive the platform gimbal rings about the pitch, 
roll and vertical axes respectively.  The gyros sense incipient displacement of the platform and 
activate the appropriate motors to provide for the relative movement of the gimbal rings, as 
the aircraft moves about the stable platform.

Inertial Navigation Systems
Earth Orientation
The previously described gyro stabilized platform would remain fixed in space, but the aircraft 
is not operating in space.  It is operating on an earth which is rotating and an earth which is 
assumed to be round.  In order to keep the accelerometers level with respect to the earth so 
that they sense acceleration of the aircraft in a horizontal direction only, some compensation 
must be made for the earth rotating and the earth being assumed to be round.
Figure 18.12 Earth orientation
Apparent Wander
Corrections must be made to gyroscopically stabilized platforms to allow for apparent 
wander due to earth rotation and aircraft movement over the earth.  The required earth rate 
compensation is a function of latitude since what is being compensated for is the horizontal 
component of the earth rate felt by the gyros, and that varies with latitude.  At the equator, 
this value is zero degrees per hour and with travel either further north or south, it increases 
until it becomes a maximum of  +/- 15.04 at the poles.
Transport rate compensation is developed using the velocity signal.  The electronics through 
which it is sent contain a term proportional to the earth’s radius.  So, in reality, the transport 
rate signal torquing the gyro is the velocity of the aircraft divided by the earth’s radius.
Both the earth rate and transport rate compensations are compensated by torquing the gyro. 
The following diagram should be used to follow the system as explained.

Inertial Navigation Systems
There are a number of compensations generated within the system.
Coriolis and centrifugal effects must be compensated for within the system. Other 
compensations are necessary because the earth is not a perfect sphere.

The stable element in an INS must be accurately aligned in both azimuth and attitude to allow 
the accelerometers to measure accelerations along their chosen axes.
•	 Warm up period - the first stage in any alignment sequence is to bring the fluid-filled 
components to the correct operating temperature.  This phase normally takes between 3 
to 4 minutes.
•	 Coarse alignment - the platform is roughly levelled and aligned in azimuth; this removes 
gyro alignment errors and cuts the time to a minimum.
•	 Coarse levelling - pitch and roll driven until they are at 90° to each other.  The platform is 
then roughly levelled using either the aircraft frame as reference, or using the outputs from 
gravity switches or the horizontal accelerometers.
•	 Coarse azimuth alignment - is achieved by turning the platform until the heading output 
agrees with the aircraft’s best known True Heading.
•	 Coarse alignment level and aligns the platform within 1° - 2° in a few seconds. 
•	 Fine levelling - with zero output from the accelerometers fine levelling is achieved. The 
process takes anything up to 1 to 1½ minutes, levelling the platform to within 6 seconds of 
arc.
•	 Gyro compassing - the platform can be aligned  in azimuth by connecting the gyro normally 
used to stabilize the platform about an east-west axis, to the azimuth gimbal motor.  With 
the platform correctly aligned in azimuth the east gyro should not be subject to rotation of 
its input axis due to earth rotation; when the platform is out of alignment the east gyro will 
detect a component of earth rotation and the resultant output signal can be used to torque 
the azimuth gyro until the table is aligned.
•	 Accelerometers must be levelled (velocity set to zero).
•	 Platform must be orientated to true north - gyro compassing (position verified).
Schuler Period
Schuler postulated an earth pendulum with length equal to the radius of the earth, its bob at 
the earth’s centre and point of suspension at the earth’s surface.  If the suspension point were 
accelerated around the earth, the bob would remain vertically below the suspension point 
because it is at the earth’s centre of gravity.  
A platform mounted on the suspension point tangential to the  earth’s surface, i.e. horizontal 
would therefore remain horizontal irrespective of the acceleration experienced.  
The vertical defined by the normal to the platform is therefore unaffected by acceleration.  If, 
for any reason the bob on the earth pendulum became displaced from the earth’s centre, the 
pendulum would start to oscillate.  The oscillation period would be 84.4 minutes.
The INS stable element is maintained normal to the local vertical by feeding back the aircraft’s 
radial velocity as levelling gyro signals, and in this way the north and east accelerometers are 
prevented from detecting components of the gravity acceleration.

Figure 18.15 The Schuler Period
The control signals are the V/R and U/R terms for vehicle movement.  By mechanizing the 
platform to remain horizontal, an analogue of the earth pendulum of period 84.4 minutes 
is produced.  Should the platform be displaced from the horizontal it would oscillate with a 
period of 84.4 minutes, which is known as the Schuler Period.
Errors of INS
Errors can be conveniently considered under the following headings:
•	 Bounded errors
•	 Unbounded errors
•	 Inherent errors
Bounded Errors
Errors which build up to a maximum and return to zero within 84.4 minutes Schuler cycle are 
termed bounded errors.  The main causes of these errors are:
•	 Platform tilt due to initial misalignment 
•	 Inaccurate measurement of acceleration by accelerometers
•	 Integrator errors in the first stage of integration
Unbounded Errors
Unbounded errors - are either cumulative track errors or distance errors:
•	 Initial azimuth misalignment of the platform
•	 Wander of the azimuth gyro
Errors which give rise to cumulative errors in the recording of distance run:
•	 Wander in the levelling gyros.  This causes a Schuler oscillation of the platform but the mean 
recorded value of distance run is increasingly divergent from the true distance run.
•	 Integrator errors in the second stage of integration.

Inertial Navigation Systems
Inherent Errors
The irregular shape and composition of the earth, the movement of the earth through space 
and other factors provide further possible sources of error.  Such errors vary from system to 
system depending upon the balance achieved between accuracy on one hand and simplicity of 
design, reliability, ease of construction and cost of production on the other. 
INS Control and Display Panels
There are many makes and models of INS currently on the market.  The “state-of-the-art” 
trend is towards a single control/display unit with a standard keyboard, but with a single small 
video screen (rather than the various individual LED windows which are shown in the following 
illustrations). With the modern video screen presentation, the loading and extraction of 
information is achieved by selecting a “page number”, with each page (which is displayed on 
the screen) dealing with associated functions.  One major advantage of this type of system is 
that hundreds or even thousands of waypoints can be “stored” in the machine memory.  These 
waypoints (normally airway reporting points such as VORs and intersections) are automatically 
loaded from a master disc, which is supplied and regularly updated by specialist agencies.
Because of the high capital investment which was involved in the last generation of INS 
systems, and because they are proving to be extremely reliable, you are perhaps more likely to 
encounter the traditional type of control/display units described below.  Another good reason 
for considering this system, rather than the modern one, is that the JAA examination questions 
are based on the older type of INS.
Figure 18.16 Mode Selector Unit
In any event, please appreciate that the following paragraphs are intended only as a general 
guide and not as a definitive operating instruction for any particular model of INS.
The traditional INS system employs two panels for control and display.  The simpler of the two, 
the mode selector panel, is shown at Figure 18.16.
The function of the mode selector panel is straightforward:
•	 In the standby mode the power is supplied to all parts of the system.  It is normal to insert 
the start position (the aircraft’s ramp position in lat/long to the nearest tenth of a minute 
of arc) whilst the equipment is in this mode.
--- Page 246 ---
Inertial Navigation Systems

Inertial Navigation Systems
•	 In the alignment mode the platform is levelled and aligned (gyro compassed), and when 
these processes are complete and READY NAV illuminated.  The equipment can now be 
switched into the Nav mode, and the aircraft is free to taxi without degrading the accuracy 
of the INS. 
There may be occasions when full navigation computing is not available but the gyros are 
serviceable.  This could be in the event of a computing malfunction so that earth rate and 
transport wander corrections cannot be calculated or it could be after an alignment failure 
in flight.
However, on many aircraft the gyros are used as primary attitude information as well as 
for inertial navigation and it may be possible to retain gyro information.  This is done by 
selecting ATT REF on the MSU.
Selecting ATT REF disconnects computing and loses alignment, if this has not already 
happened anyway.  The accelerometers now act as gravity switches, as they do during the 
levelling phase of alignment and the gyros become gravity-tied in the long term - earth 
gyros.  The system now gives attitude information and a limited form of heading.  The gyros 
are normally very accurate, but there is no correction for earth rate and transport wander 
and the heading needs to be reset periodically to an independent (usually magnetic) source. 
In effect, the gyros are acting as a super-accurate form of DGI and as an attitude indicator.
Should the aircraft electrical supply to the INS cease for any reason the INS will automatically 
switch to its own battery pack.  For as long as a satisfactory level of power is being supplied by 
the internal battery, the INS BATT light will be illuminated on the Control and Display Unit.  As 
the power from the battery starts to fail, the BATT warning light on the Mode Selector Unit will 
illuminate, indicating that the INS is about to fail.  If you are half way across the Pacific Ocean 
at this time, this could spoil your whole day, since of course the INS cannot be re-levelled and/
or re-aligned in flight (for this the aircraft must be stationary, and the exact position known).
The control/display unit (CDU) is shown at Figure 18.17.
The reader who has completed 
his or her studies of the radio 
syllabus 
will 
undoubtedly 
notice the similarity between 
this CDU and the control/
display   panel of a similar 
vintage VLF/Omega receiver. 
Although the inputs for the 
two equipments are vastly 
different, the presentation 
of navigational information 
to  the pilot is more or less 
identical in both cases.

As already mentioned, these notes are not intended as an operator’s brief, but rather to help 
you pass an examination.  Please appreciate that, although other INS panels may look dissimilar 
to the one shown at Figure 18.17 the information given by the system will be basically the same.
Using the panel shown at Figure 18.17 let us start at the top left hand corner and look at the 
function of each of the displays and controls.
The two large windows at the top of the panel (labelled left and right numerical displays) 
comprise the principal outputs of the system.  Glance now at the function selector (bottom left 
hand corner), we will start with the selector in the seven o’clock position (TK/GS) and work 
anticlockwise through the functions considering the values shown in the two LED windows as 
we go.
The waypoint selector switch is thumbed to the appropriate waypoint number (shown in the 
window to the left of the thumbwheel) when  loading the waypoint lat/longs before flight, 
reloading new waypoints in flight, or checking that waypoints are correctly loaded.
The FROM/TO waypoint display shows the two waypoints between which the INS assumes that 
it is flying.  All digital read-outs flight director displays and autopilot commands will be based 
on this information, and so you can imagine the consequences or either giving the equipment 
the wrong to/from waypoint numbers or feeding the system with the wrong waypoint lat/
long to begin with.
The track change push-button enables the operator to tell the system between which two 
waypoints the aircraft is required to fly (in the event that the system is not set up to fly 
sequentially through the loaded waypoints).
The DIM control governs the brightness of the LED displays and the panel lighting.
The ALERT annunciator warns the operator that the aircraft is approaching the next waypoint. 
In AUTO mode the alert light will come on, steady, 2 minutes to run to the waypoint, and will 
extinguish as the track changes overhead the waypoint.  In MANUAL mode the alert light will 
come on, steady, 2 minutes to run to the waypoint; the light will then flash 30 seconds before 
the waypoint, and will continue to flash until the track is changed. The annunciator will not 
illuminate below a set speed (typically either 100 kt or 250 kt).
The battery annunciator will illuminated when the INS is operating on internal power.
The warning annunciator illuminates when a system malfunction occurs.
The auto/manual/remote switch determines the level of pilot intervention necessary to fly the 
aircraft.  In the automatic mode the INS will automatically switch from one track to the next 
as each waypoint is overflown.  In the manual mode the operator is required to update the 
waypoint from/to read-out as each waypoint is overflown.  The exact function of the remote 
position will depend on the complexity of the INS computer programme, and is outside the 
scope of this syllabus but in general terms it allows for simultaneous insertion of waypoints into 
more than one INS from one CDU.
The INSERT push-button is used in conjunction with the data input keyboard to enter 
information into the system.
Finally, the HOLD push-button is used primarily for updating the INS position when overflying 
a reliable fix, such as a VOR overhead.  The HOLD button is depressed as the fix is overflown,

the function switch is placed in the POS (position) mode, the exact lat/long of the radio fix (in 
this case the lat/long of the VOR) is punched into the machine, and the hold button is then 
released. Appreciate that if this is done, the radial error rate assessment (discussed shortly) will 
be invalid, unless the position update vector is accounted for.

Heading & Drift
The INS derived true heading (the angle 
between the north-south axis of the platform 
and the aircraft fore and aft axis in a north 
aligned system) is shown to the nearest tenth 
of a degree in the LH window.
The INS derived drift angle is shown to the 
nearest tenth of a degree in the RH window, 
and is preceded by an L (left/port drift)  or  an 
R (right/starboard drift).
The heading is 050°(T) and the drift 10°.        
Cross Track Error & Track Keeping Error
XTK/TKE (Cross track distance and track error angle). The cross track distance (the displacement 
of the aircraft perpendicularly from the  direct great circle track between the two waypoints 
selected) is shown to the nearest tenth of a nautical mile in the LH window.  This figure is 
preceded by an L or an R to indicate that the aircraft is left or right of the direct track.
Figure 18.20 XTK / TKE (Cross track distance and track error angle)
The track angle error (the angle between the track which the aircraft would require to make 
good were it flying along the great circle route between the specified waypoints and the track 
which it is actually making good) is shown to the nearest tenth of a degree in the RH window. 
The L or R which precedes this value indicates that the actual track is to the left or right of the 
required track. In this case, remembering that we desire a track of 060°, we must be “making 
good” a track of 040° because we have an indication that we are tracking 20° to the left of our 
desired track between consecutive waypoints.
In summary the cross track error is 12 NM to the right and the track angle error is 20° to the left 
in the situation also shown at Figure 18.20

Present Position
The aircraft’s present latitude is shown to the 
nearest tenth of a minute of arc in the LH 
window.
The aircraft’s present longitude is shown to 
the nearest tenth of a minute of arc in the RH 
window.
The aircraft’s position is therefore shown as 
34°31.5’N 117°11.3’W.
Waypoint Positions
The waypoint positions are shown in latitude 
(LH window) and longitude (RH window) to 
the nearest tenth of a minute of arc.
In the system which we are considering there 
are 10 possible waypoint selections (0 through 
9).  Waypoints 1 through 9 are simply  selected 
turning  points,  and  are normally placed into 
the system by the operator before the flight.
Waypoint   0   represents   the   aircraft’s 
position  at the last time a track change from 
present   position   to   a   specified waypoint 
was selected by the operator.
Let us consider briefly how this could be useful.
Suppose that you are half way between, say, 
waypoints 3 and 4 and air traffic control  clear 
you direct  to  waypoint 6.  By selecting a track 
change from waypoint 0 (the aircraft’s present position) to waypoint 6 and inserting it, the 
aircraft will fly you directly to Wpt 6 if coupled to the flight director/autopilot.
Figure 18.23 Waypoint Zero
Waypoint zero is reserved for the  computer  to establish a track from the aircraft’s present 
position and will not accept operator entered waypoint co-ordinates.

Distance and Time
The distance to go from the aircraft’s present 
position direct to the next selected waypoint 
is shown to the nearest nautical mile in the LH 
window.
The lapsed time from the aircraft’s present 
position to the next waypoint is shown to the 
nearest tenth of a minute in the RH window.
The distance to go here is shown as 140 NM 
and the time as 16.7 minutes.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Wind Speed and Direction
The INS derived  wind direction (°T) is shown 
to the nearest degree in the LH window.
INS derived wind speed is shown to the nearest 
knot in the RH window.
The W/V is shown as 155°(T)/85 kt.
Desired Track and Status
The desired track (assuming that the aircraft 
is on the direct great circle track between the 
two selected waypoints) is shown in degrees 
true to the nearest tenth of a degree in the 
LH window.
Figure 18.26 DSR TK / STS (Desired track and status)
The RH window will normally be blank, since the status check is generally only available with 
the equipment in the alignment mode.

Inertial Navigation Systems
The desired track is 060.0°(T) which allows us to see the relationship between the aircraft’s 
current position and track and the direct track between the two selected waypoints.  You 
may by now have reached the conclusion that the programme upon which the INS computer 
operates assumes that the INS will normally operate coupled to the flight director/autopilot, 
so that across track errors do not occur.
Test
The diagram at Figure 18.27 shows the 
function   switch in the test position resulting 
in all of the digits on the various displays being 
illuminated either showing a figure or letters. 
This enables the operator to check that all of 
the functions are operating.
	
	
	
	
	
Manual and Automatic System Checks
At the initial setting up stage the start position must be fed into the INS computer with a 
high degree of accuracy.  If the initial latitude is slightly in error the platform will not remain 
earth horizontal once the equipment is switched into the navigation mode, since the torque 
motors will be tilting the platform at an inappropriate rate, due to computer calculations 
based on incorrect latitude.  Likewise, and for the same reasons, the platform will not remain 
directionally aligned with respect to north.
If the initial latitude setting is grossly in error the system will detect the error and warn the 
operator (this is one of the principal functions of the warning annunciator on the CDU whilst 
the equipment is in the align mode). The equipment is able to sense a gross latitude input error 
since the apparent drift and topple rates sensed by the rate gyros will not correspond to the 
corrections being applied by the torque motors.
An incorrect operator input of longitude will not affect the stability of the platform, but 
obviously the track and distance from the departure point to the first waypoint will be 
incorrectly computed. Furthermore, all subsequent indications of longitude will be in error by 
the amount of the initial input error.
An incorrect input of the lat/long of any of the waypoints will have serious consequences.  The 
INS will navigate very accurately between waypoints, but it is incapable of detecting operator 
malfunctions (finger trouble)!  In order to check that the waypoints have been correctly 
inserted they should be recalled from store onto the LED display, and rechecked before flight.
A second check is to call up the initial great circle track (TK/GS) and distances (DIS/TIME) 
between consecutive waypoints, and to compare these values against those shown on the 
flight log/flight progress log/flight plan.

Inertial Reference System
Inertial Reference System
The laser gyro has caused a technological revolution in the design of inertial reference and 
navigation systems.  This solid state high precision, angular rate sensor is ideally suited for 
highly reliable strap down system configuration.  It eliminates the need for gimbals, bearings, 
torque  motors,  and  other  moving  parts,  and  consequently  changes  the  system  operation 
considerably from conventional inertial navigation systems.
Figure 19.1 GEC-Marconi FIN3060 Commercial Aircraft Inertial Reference
Inertial Navigation
Inertial Navigation means the determination of a vehicle’s location without the aid of external 
references.  Strap down inertial navigation goes a step further by enabling navigation without 
the use of a mechanically stabilized platform.  This has been achieved through the advent of 
laser gyros / rate sensors  and powerful, high speed microprocessors.  The laser gyros allow a 
microprocessor to maintain a stable platform mathematically, rather than mechanically.

Inertial Information
Inertial information is used by: 
•	 Flight management computer 
•	 Flight control computer 
•	 Thrust management computer
•	 Stability augmentation system
•	 Weather radar
•	 Anti-skid auto brake systems 
•	 Attitude direction indicator 
•	 Horizontal situation indicator 
•	 Vertical speed indicator
•	 Radio direction magnetic indicator
•	 Flight data recorder
The Primary Sources of Information
The primary sources of information for the IRU are its own internal sensors, three laser 
gyros, and three inertial accelerometers.  The only other inputs required are initial position, 
barometric altitude, and True Airspeed (TAS).
Initial position is required because present position is calculated from the distance and direction 
travelled from the initial start position entered.
Barometric altitude stabilizes the vertical navigation, and thereby stabilizes the vertical velocity 
and inertial altitude outputs.
The TAS input allows the IRU to calculate wind speed and wind direction.

Inertial Reference System
The Laser Gyro
The laser gyro is an example of the application that uses the characteristics of light to measure 
motion.  This device operates based on the SAGNAC effect.  One beam rotates in one direction 
and the other beam in the opposite direction. One of the conditions that must be satisfied to 
maintain lasing is that the number of wavelengths in the beams path length must equal a whole 
number.  When the wavelengths change there is  a concurrent change in the light’s frequency. 
This means that in a rotating gyro, one laser beam will exhibit an increase in frequency, whereas 
the other beam will exhibit a frequency decrease.  The frequency difference between the two 
beams is easily and accurately measured along optical paths.
Principles of Laser Gyros and IRS
Laser (Light Amplification and Stimulated Emission of Radiation) gyros measure rotation by 
comparing two laser beams created and directed to rotate in opposite directions within a very 
narrow tunnel.  Photons are emitted within the laser cavity in all directions but only the light 
that radiates backwards and forwards between the mirrors is reinforced by repeated trips 
through the gain medium: continued  passage amplification soon reaches saturation and a 
steady state oscillation ensues,  a laser beam.
Construction and Operation
Construction.  The laser gyro contains three mirrors to achieve a rotational path for two beams 
that are generated and sent around in a triangular path in opposite directions.  The lasers are 
sent around small tunnels drilled parallel to the perimeter of a triangular block of temperature 
stable glass with reflecting mirrors placed in each corner.
Lasing is achieved by running high voltages through helium neon gas between the anodes and 
the cathode transforming many of the atoms of the gas into light in the pinkish orange part of 
the visible spectrum (this action is helped by the tuned cavity effect of the tunnel in the glass 
block).
Operation.  The laser beam that is created can be described as a high energy beam  of coherent 
light which is said to be of a pure frequency.  The light will be reflected by the mirrors but light 
of unwanted frequencies ( i.e. not at the design frequency) will be absorbed by the mirrors and 
their coatings.  Because the frequency of the light is known it can be measured and modified 
by adjustment of the path length i.e. “If the path length is decreased, the light is compressed 
and the frequency will increase - if the path length is expanded, the frequency decreases”.

Inertial Reference System
Figure 19.2 
The triangular path of the device does not rotate but the two beams of light are caused to 
travel in opposite directions and will of course travel at the same speed - the speed of light.
If there is no movement of the device the beams cancel each other out but when movement is 
induced one of the beams will take longer to complete its path and the other, in opposition, a 
measurably shorter length of time to complete its journey.  This whole process is measured by 
devices known as gain elements and the rate of rotation can be calculated.
A laser gyro is used in an IRS as an Angular Rate Sensor. 
The change in frequency, caused by the change in path length due to rotation of the gyro, is 
known as the SAGNAC effect.
The three mirrors involved are not identical - one makes micro adjustments to keep the physical 
light path accurately aligned and another is partially transparent to allow the laser light to be 
detected on the photo cell detectors.
Included with the second mirror is a prism which flips / redirects the light beam around causing 
it to meet and interfere with the light beam that is aimed directly at the photo cell.  The beams 
alternately cancel and reinforce each other (known as interference) thus generating a fringe 
pattern.
The photoelectric cell detects the direction and speed at which the fringe pattern moves.  The 
change in the pattern, moving in one direction or other, depends upon which way the laser 
gyro is being rotated.  The faster the rotation the faster the fringe pattern moves across the 
photoelectric cell - this is then converted to signals used within the aircraft systems.
Limitations and Accuracy
Drift.  The principle source of error with this form of device, as with the conventional gyro 
stabilized platform INS device, is associated with random drift.  In a conventional gyro this 
is caused by imperfections of gyro bearings and mass imbalances but with the laser system 
noise is the cause and this is derived almost entirely from imperfections in the mirrors and their 
coatings.

Accuracy.  The accuracy of the laser system is directly influenced by the length of its optical 
path - the longer the path available the greater the accuracy with a small percentage increase 
in length leading to a substantial increase in accuracy.
Lock in.  The most significant potential problem is lock in, also known as laser lock, which 
occurs at very low rotation rates.
At very low rotation rates the output frequency can drop to zero as a result of back scattering 
between the two beams which causes the beams to synchronize, that is, no longer indicate the 
rotation  correctly and indeed introduce undesirable errors.  This phenomena is overcome by 
the introduction of a vibration device known as a piezo electric dither motor which breaks the 
lock in.  The motor is mounted in such a way that it vibrates the laser ring about its input axis 
through the lock in region, thereby unlocking the beams and enabling the optical sensor to 
detect the smaller movement  of  the  fringe pattern.  The motions caused by the dither motor 
are decoupled from the output of the ring laser gyro / rate sensor.
Platform / Strap Down Principles
Platform.  The INS (platform set in gimbals) requires three rate integrating gyros and 
accelerometers to achieve an output that we can use and this process is started by ensuring 
that the platform is horizontal at the correct latitude. IRS (strap down) attaches the three laser 
gyro / rate sensors and accelerometers directly to the aircraft chassis.
High speed microprocessors then achieve a stable platform mathematically rather than 
mechanically (as per the INS) - this results in greatly improved accuracy and reliability.
Integration.  Integration principles are used as per the older INS system.
Gravity.  Gravity - the microprocessor subtracts the effect of local gravity from any vertical 
acceleration to compensate for local effects.
Earth rotation.  Earth rotation rate - compensated for at the rate of 15.04 degrees as with a 
gyro (INS) system.
Transport compensation.  Transport rate - Schuler tuning is again required to compensate 
for oscillation errors as the system is transported over the earth (this in relation to pendulum 
theory which results in an 84.4 minute error cycle as described in the older INS).
Calibration.  Automatic calibration - completed automatically by computer to enhance the 
overall accuracy of the system.
Platform Alignment
True North.  The system, as with the INS, requires to find true north to achieve an alignment 
and this is achieved when the aircraft is stationary on the ground and the only rate of change 
is that associated with the movement of the earth.  True north is then found.
Latitude.  Initial latitude must be put into the system by the operator, the computer then, after 
assessing the rotational vectors that it is experiencing, compares the latitude it finds with that 
entered by the operator during initialization. However, it should be noted that with this system 
the inbuilt memory function remembers its position at landing and will indicate to the crew any 
errors of initial position input (lat’or long’) upon startup.

Alignment.  The computer, after confirming the latitude, completes  a full mathematical 
levelling process - initial latitude and longitude must be entered manually as a present position 
to assist this align - THE AIRCRAFT MUST NOT BE MOVED DURING THIS PROCESS.
This process is called Establishing the Trihedron.
Advantages

Manoeuvring.  Insensitive to “g” attitude, rolling, pitching manoeuvres. 
Construction.  Mechanically simple and highly reliable.
Range.  Wide dynamic range.

Radio Altimeter
Introduction
The Radio Altimeter is a device capable of measuring the height of an aircraft above ground 
with a high degree of accuracy.  Apart from providing a flight deck display of height above 
ground level (AGL), the radio altimeter has two other important functions:  
•	 It supplies the automatic flight system with data to affect automatic landings when used in 
association with the ILS / MLS.
•	 It furnishes height information and rate of change of height to the Ground Proximity 
Warning System (GPWS), and is a crucial component of this system.
The instrument makes use of primary radio principles transmitting a Frequency Modulated 
Continuous Wave (FMCW) in an elliptical pattern vertically below the aircraft.
The radio altimeter determines the time taken for a radio wave to travel from the aircraft to 
the ground directly beneath the aircraft and back again.  During this time the transmitted 
frequency changes at a known rate from its start level to +50 MHz and back again to complete 
a “cycle”.
The carrier frequency cannot be increased indefinitely and so after half a wavelength the 
change is reversed, the frequency then being decreased at a constant rate down to a specified 
value before being increased again. The complete “modulation cycle/frequency sweep” is 
illustrated in Figure 20.1.
Figure 20.1
The equipment compares the frequencies of the transmitted and received signals and  since 
the rate of frequency change is known, the frequency difference becomes a measure of the 
time taken for the radio wave to travel to and from the surface. From the information gained 
aircraft height may be determined.
The breakdown of frequency difference, which occurs when the transmitter changes the 
direction of its frequency sweep, is overcome by relating aircraft height to the average beat 
frequency (the difference between transmitted and received frequency) observed over a short 
sampling period. The frequency changeover points are thereby ignored.

Frequencies
Two frequency bands have been used in the past, but only the SHF band is used at present:
4200 MHz to 4400 MHz - SHF band
1600 MHz to 1660 MHz - UHF band
The total sweep of the carrier frequency is automatically varied ± 50 MHz 300 times a second. 
At very low altitude with  the  reflection returning almost instantaneously, a wide sweep is 
necessary to give a measurable frequency difference.  The signal is transmitted downwards 
from a flush mounted horn antenna.  The conical / elliptical beam generated is wide enough to 
always allow some portion of the beam to travel vertically even with pitch angles of ±30° and 
roll angles of ±60°.  The height will be determined from the shortest path to the ground which, 
of course, will always be vertically below the aircraft.
Transmission being  continuous, it is necessary to use a separate antenna, similar to the 
transmitting antenna for reception. The receiver antenna needs to be positioned far enough 
away to avoid interference with the transmitted signal.
Radiated power generated is of the order of one watt.

Height Scale
The scale is logarithmic being expanded from zero to 500 feet and at a reduced non-linear scale 
from 500 to 2500 feet.
Mask
The height pointer disappears behind a mask:
•	 when altitude exceeds 2500 feet
•	 when there is any fault in the transmitted signal
•	 when the altimeter is switched off
Failure Warning Flag
The flag appears when there is too much radio noise which will corrupt the returning signal, 
or if  local reflections are received from the airframe itself, or in the event of a loss of power to 
the equipment.
Press to Test Button/Height Selector
When this button is pressed,  the  height  pointer  swings round to a known pre-set altitude. 
This provides a confidence check for the user indicating  that the equipment is likely to operate 
satisfactorily. This button is a dual-purpose device. When turned, it selects the reference Low 
Altitude Index to the desired height.
Low Height Warning
The warning light illuminates if the aircraft is flown below any pre-selected height set by the 
pilot. This occurrence is also audibly marked by the sudden cessation  of an alert tone which will 
sound with increasing loudness from approximately 100 feet above the decision height setting.

Digital Read-out - Boeing Style
A digital read-out, and when below 1000 ft a pictorial image of an altimeter dial, is drawn on 
some EFIS displays.  The colour of this icon (which also shrinks in size below 1000 ft indicating 
height change) changes from white to flashing amber as decision height is approached. One 
further function of the radio altimeter is to desensitize the autopilot and flight director response 
to the ILS glidepath in the latter stage of an approach.
EFIS Indicator - Airbus Style
Figure 20.6  
On some more modern systems, such as that used by the A300, the indication of  height is 
given at the base of the EADI / PFD attitude display.  This height indication changes colour 
from Green to Amber and the numbers also grow in size as Decision Height is passed. It is also 
important to note that the Radio Altimeter is a major component of the Ground Proximity 
Warning System (GPWS).

Radio Altimeter
Range and Accuracy
The instrument can be used between zero and 2500 feet above the surface with an overall 
expected accuracy of ± 3% of indicated height or ± 1ft whichever is the greater. The figures 
include various error  contributors, principally Doppler shift, step error in the digital counting 
circuits, and height lag.
Aircraft Installation Delay
(Cable Length Compensation)
The radio altimeter is required to indicate zero height AGL as the main wheels touch down 
on the runway; because of this it has to be extremely accurate and in practice is designed to 
perform to an accuracy of +/- one foot.  However, in practice a single manufacturer’s product 
may be found in multiple aircraft types from the very large Boeing 747 to a much smaller 
corporate commuter jet and this must be catered for.  At either extreme the aircraft weight 
and  oleo compression will vary and this leads to the need for compensation to cater for this 
variable.  The height difference between the antennas on the fuselage and the bottom of the 
trailing wheels on the main landing gear bogeys, on the approach to a touchdown, is known as 
the Residual Height. In addition, the different physical sizes of the aircraft concerned will create 
differences in cable run length between the avionics bay and the position of the antennas on 
the underside of the aircraft fuselage.  When investigating the larger aircraft this distance may 
be as much as 100 ft or, in the smaller jet, as little as 6 ft.  If compensation for cable length is 
not catered for in the larger aircraft an error would be generated and this would be seen as an 
error of height (perhaps up to 100 ft in the example above).
The aircraft installation delay is therefore adjusted to compensate for residual height and cable 
length (times two - Tx antennas/Rx antennas to avionics bay). This is done to ensure that at 
touchdown with the main bogeys trailing the radio altimeter reads zero.
Additionally, it should be noted that when on the ground, the radio altimeter may show a 
small negative altitude.  The reason for this is that the equipment has been adjusted to indicate 
zero when the main wheels first touch the runway surface on landing and therefore when 
the aircraft is level on the ground the antenna will be below its calibrated position relative 
to the aircraft landing attitude.  The effect is particularly noticeable with aircraft such as the 
B747 (which actually indicates -8 ft) which have multi-wheel assemblies which are inclined at 
an upward angle when deployed in flight and thereby create a larger difference between 
antenna position and wheels at the point of touchdown.

Flight Management System
Principle of Operation
Flight management systems are designed to improve navigation, aid fuel efficiency and to 
reduce crew  workload. Computers are used to fly aircraft along complex routes using Lateral 
Guidance (LNAV).
Vertical Guidance (VNAV) enables the system to calculate optimum cruise altitudes and to 
determine the best combination of autothrottle control and speed during climb and descent.
At all times when the crew are not actually controlling the aircraft by hand, they use the FMS 
controls to “fly” the aircraft.  The controls of an FMS are, in effect, a miniature flight deck with 
fingertip control.

Control and Display Unit (CDU)
The primary function of the CDU is to act as the interface between the aircraft and the crew. 
The  CDU  can  be  used  to  command  completely  automatic  control  of  the  aircraft  or semi-
automatic with varying degrees of pilot involvement including full manual control.
Two CDUs are usually fitted either side of the centre console with the left CDU normally being 
the master (in the B747-400 they are joined by a third CDU placed upon the centre console 
for use primarily by engineering staff). They comprise a monochrome or coloured cathode ray 
tube (CRT) display on which different “pages” of selected data can be shown, and a selector 
key panel.

Figure 21.2 
The FMCs may be decoupled to provide fully Independent Mode operation. This is not usual in 
that there will be no safety/cross check between the two FMCs.
When operating in Dual Mode (the norm for ordinary flight profiles) both FMCs independently 
process pilot entries on both MCDUs and compare the results to ensure that crucial information 
is consistent on both systems. The same output is then passed to both FMCs.
If there is a failure of an FMC, the second system can be expected to operate the aircraft 
successfully on its own - this is known as Single Mode.  The failed FMC may be selected out of 
the system to allow single mode operation of the “surviving” FMC if required by the crew. 
Data Base
The information stored in the FMC is called its data base.  The data base is divided into two 
major  sections.    One  contains  performance  related  information  and  the  other  contains 
information dealing with navigation.
--- Page 279 ---

         Flight Management System

Flight Management System
The purpose of the performance data base is to reduce the need for the flight crew to refer to 
the Cruise Control  Manual  during flight and to provide the FMC with information required to 
calculate pitch and thrust commands.  All reference data normally required can be displayed on 
the FMS-CDU.  The data stored in the data base includes aircraft drag and engine characteristics, 
maximum and minimum speeds.  Maintenance can refine the data base for each aircraft by 
entering factors for drag and fuel flow.
The FMC navigation data base includes most information that would normally be determined 
by referring to navigation charts.  This information may be displayed on the FMS-CDU / AMD 
and eliminates most of the cockpit chart reading in aircraft without an FMC.  The geographic 
area covered includes all areas where the aircraft is normally flown.  The stored information 
includes the location of navigation aids, airports, runways and other airline selected information 
such as SIDs, STARs, approaches and company routes.
The FMC contains two sets of navigation data, each valid for 28 days.  Each set corresponds 
to the normal revision cycle for navigation charts.  During preflight the flight crew can select 
which set is active.  The FMC uses the active set for navigation calculations.  The contents of the 
navigation data base are updated by maintenance every 28 days.  When the navigation chart 
revision date arrives, the new data is already in the FMC and ready for selection.
Operational Procedures - Initial Actions
IDENT Page:   Upon application of power to the aircraft the FMS immediately executes a 
self-test procedure and upon its successful self completion the IDENT page of the system is 
displayed. The IDENT page of the FMC allows the crew to confirm aircraft details on start-up 
and this in turn initiates a series of prompts to direct the crew through the route procedures 
that need to be generated for their flight. Importantly on this page we have confirmation of 
the navigation data base in operation and an indication of the date of changeover to the next 
programme - if the data base is out of date it will tell us to change to the in date programme.
POS INIT Page:   When we have checked the IDENT page we will be directed to the POS INIT page 
where we must check the FMS clock time against the aircraft clock to ensure synchronization 
between the systems: data is saved on the FDR against time and of course ETAs are generated 
by the FMC and need to be in line with times indicated by the aircraft clock. As we complete 
this task we must also ensure that the airfield datum or gate position, if available, is entered 
accurately to allow for IRS alignment (this position will be suitable for alignment but is often 
updated at the take-off point to obtain the best possible initial position for use in flight).
RTE Page:   After completing our tasks upon the POS INIT page we will be directed to the RTE 
page where we will enter our starting and destination airport ICAO designators. We may then 
expect to enter our flight number details and identify a “standard” company route to take us 
to our destination: if a standard route is not available, other actions will have to be taken to 
input the information into the system.
PERF INIT Page:   We may now move on to the PERF INIT page to update the aircraft to its 
current performance / weight configuration for the route to be flown. On this page we may 
input details of fuel weight, fuel reserves required, cruise altitude and even, in the case of the 
B747, if we are carrying a fifth engine to our destination upon its suspension point on the wing. 
At this stage we may also enter Cost Index requirements related to our flight as discussed later 
in the chapter.

Operational Procedures - Climb Vertical Navigation (VNAV) 
Entering a cost index of “ZERO” provides economy speeds representing a maximum range 
cruise. The VNAV profile that the FMC commands is a climb with climb thrust to remain within 
all airspeed and altitude constraints that are part of the SID entered into the active route, then 
climb at economy speed to the entered cruise altitude.
If when flying the climb speed profile it would cause a violation of an altitude constraint, the 
UNABLE NEXT ALT message is displayed.  The pilot must then select a different speed on the 
FMS-CDU that provides a steeper climb angle.  Reaching cruise altitude, the FMC commands 
cruise at economy speed until the top of descent point.
A number of cost index modifications are allowed until passing Top of Descent point (TOD) for 
example Long Range Cruise (LRC) and “selected speed” cruise may also be entered.

Notes:  Time Related Cost is a function of speed selected; the higher the speed in climb, cruise 
or descent the higher the “trip fuel cost” but the lower the “trip time cost”.
Economy Cruise Mode will yield the lowest operating cost based on the cost index.
Cost Index is determined by dividing aeroplane operating cost ($ / £ per hour) by fuel cost ($ / 
£ per pound or litre). A cost index of zero results in “minimum trip fuel operation” and so will 
include cruise at “maximum range” cruise and a low speed descent.
Operational Procedures - Cruise Lateral Navigation (LNAV)
LNAV guidance outputs from the FMC are normally great circle tracks between the waypoints 
making up the active route.  However, when a procedure stored in the FMS data base is entered 
into the active route the FMC can supply commands to fly a constant heading, track or follow 
a DME arc, as required to comply with the procedure.
FMC determines present position by using inputs from the IRS / INS, DME, VOR and other 
navigation systems fitted.  It uses its calculated present position to generate lateral steering 
commands along the active leg to the active waypoint.  To function, the FMC requires position 
information from at least one IRS / INS.  While the aircraft is on the ground, the FMC calculates 
present position based only on information received from the IRS / INSs.
The FMC present position is normally the combination of all IRS / INS positions and since inertial 
systems accumulate position errors as a function of time, the position information being used 
by the FMC is slowly accumulating errors.   These position errors can be detected by observing 
the various positions of the individual IRS / INSs on the CDU.  If an extended ground delay 
occurs and a significant map error is noticed, the IRS / INS should be realigned and present 
position re-entered.
Operational Procedures -  Descent
When a programmed “arrival” is entered, the FMC calculates  a  descent path based on the 
procedure’s airspeed and altitude constraints and the End of Descent (E/D).   The E/D is a 
waypoint with an altitude and airspeed constraint that coincides with a final approach fix or 
runway threshold.
For VFR and non-precision approaches, the FMC computed path is built to a point that is 50 
feet over the approach end of the runway.  It is the flight crew’s responsibility to not descend 
below “DH” until adequate visual contact has been  achieved.  During a missed approach, 
LNAV guidance is available to the missed approach point and altitude.
Operational Procedures - Accuracy
Radial error rates of less than 0.05 NM/hour are not uncommon. Introduction of  Ground 
Positioning by Satellite (GPS) as a navigation input will improve overall performance.  It must 
be stressed, however, that the skill of the operator and the need for constant  and  careful 
monitoring will always be a deciding factor.

Operational Procedures - Control and Display Unit
CDU Key Groups.  The keys on the lighted switch panel of the CDU perform various functions 
and may be broken down into three major groups:
•	 Alphanumeric
•	 Function and Mode
•	 Line Select Keys (LSK)
The function of each of the keys is briefly described below:
Alphanumeric Keys - Pressing any alphanumeric key results in that character appearing in the 
scratch pad.
Function and Mode Keys - Used for initializing the system, access to flight planning functions 
and status, and modifying the flight plan. Select climb, cruise or descent information for 
preplanning or modification.
      
 CLB
CLB  (climb)  - displays  current  or  alternate  climb  mode  for assessment 
and selection.  Cruise altitude is enterable, as is a speed / altitude 
restriction.
CRZ
CRZ (cruise) - displays current or alternate cruise mode for assessment 
and selection.  Information about optimum altitude, step-climb savings, 
and turbulence penetration N1 targets is also available.
DES
DES (descent) - displays current or alternate descent mode for assessment 
and selection.  Target speed is enterable, as is a speed / altitude restriction. 
Flight Path Angle (FPA), Vertical Speed (V/S), and Vertical Bearing (V/B). 
Information is provided for crew reference
INIT  REF
INIT/REF (initialization / reference) - allows access to data pages required 
for start-up of the FMCS and IRS. Also, the operator may select various 
reference data and maintenance pages.
N1 LIMIT
N1 Limit - permits manual command of the active N1 limit, and selection 
of any Reduced Climb N1 Limit that may apply.  (Allows the crew to select 
an engine, “LP Turbine”, rpm.)
MENU
The N1 Limit key may be shown as a menu key on the master (left hand) 
CDU and can be used to find data within the system.
DEP  ARR
DEP/ARR  (departures  /  arrivals)  -  used  for  selection  of  the procedures 
and runways at the origin and destination airports.
RTE
RTE (route) - permits flight plan data entries.  A primary means for lateral 
flight plan alteration.
LEGS
LEGS (route legs) - displays and accepts entries of detailed data concerning 
each leg of the flight plan, for both the lateral and vertical paths
HOLD
HOLD - permits planning or initiation of holding at a designated waypoint.

  DIR INTC
DIR/INTC (direct / intercept) - provides data capability to proceed direct 
to any point desired, or to intercept any leg presently in the flight plan.
FIX
FIX (fix information) - displays range and bearing data from the present 
position to an entered fix.  Facilitates creation of fixes for use in flight 
planning.
PROG
PROG (flight progress) - displays current flight status information such 
as ETA, fuel remaining at waypoint, navigation radio tuning status, 
wind, and path errors.
Line Select Keys (LSK) - entry of data from the scratch pad into the 
selected line and field is accomplished by using the LSKs. There are 
twelve LSKs on the CDU panel, six each to the left and right of the CRT 
display. Data entries are permitted only on lines adjacent to the LSKs. 
Data can also be duplicated into the blank scratch pad by pressing the 
LSK adjacent to the desired data line.
EXEC
EXEC (execute) - used to incorporate data displayed on the CDU as part 
of the active flight plan.  The EXEC key is operable when its annunciator 
bar is illuminated. The key is used for activating the flight plan, changing 
the active flight plan, changing the active guidance mode, or inserting 
data which will affect the active flight plan, guidance mode, or data 
base.  Illumination of the white annunciator bar indicates that a valid 
set of data is on display and may be made active for guidance of the 
aircraft. 
+ / -
Change Sign Key - changes data in the scratch pad from positive to 
negative and back again.  May also be used to insert a hyphen for 
specialized data entries.
NEXT PAGE
Page  Select  Keys  -  when  multiple-page  displays  are  shown, pressing 
the NEXT PAGE key advances the display to the next higher page 
number.
PREV PAGE
Pressing PREV PAGE backs up the display to the next lower page number. 
Page access wraps around.
CLR
Clear Key - the scratch pad’s contents can be edited or cleared by 
pressing the CLR key.  When an entry is present in the scratch pad, a 
brief depression of the CLR key will clear the last character in the entry. 
If the CLR key is held down for more than one second, the entire entry 
in the scratch pad will be cleared.  The CLR key is also used to clear 
advisory and alerting messages from the scratch pad.
DEL
Delete Key - the delete (DEL) key is used to remove data from a display 
(and thus a flight plan) after it has been line selected and accepted 
into a data field. If the scratch pad is empty, depression of the DEL 
key writes (“DELETE”) into the scratch pad.  The delete process is then 
completed by line-selecting (LSK) the data item to be removed. If the 
deletion is a valid one, the data field reverts to its default value (box 
prompts, dashes, or a system-generated value).  The system prevents 
invalid use of the DEL key.

Electronic Flight Information Systems
The Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS)
The Electronic Flight Instrument System presents attitude and navigation information to the 
pilot on two electronic display units  in  a format that is easier to read and less likely to be 
misinterpreted than some older mechanical instruments.
As far as the pure basic functions and number of display units are concerned, this system, 
which is generally referred to as ‘EFIS’ is fully integrated with digital computer-based navigation 
systems, and utilizes colour Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)  types of 
Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) and Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI).
The system is therefore extremely advanced, not only in terms of physical construction, but 
also in the extent to which it can present attitude and navigational data to the flight crew of 
an aircraft.
The Units of a System
As in the case of a multi-crew conventional flight director system, a complete EFIS installation 
is made up of left (Captain), and right (First Officer), systems.
Each system in turn is comprised of:
•	 Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) or Primary Flight Display (PFD)
•	 Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI) or Navigation Display (ND)
•	 Control Panel
•	 Symbol Generator (SG)
•	 Remote Light Sensor Unit
A third (centre) symbol generator is also incorporated so that its drive signals may be switched 
to either the left or right display units in the event of failure of their corresponding symbol 
generators.
The signal switching  is accomplished within the left and right symbol generators, using 
electromechanical relays powered  from an aircraft’s DC power supply, via pilot-controlled 
switches.
The interface between EFIS units, data busses and other systems is shown in Figure 22.1.
Symbol Generators (SGs)
Symbol generators provide the analogue, discrete, and digital signal interfaces between 
an aircraft’s systems, the display units and the control panel, and they also perform symbol 
generation monitoring, power control and the main control functions of the ‘EFIS’ overall.
The interfacing between the card modules of an SG is shown in Figure 22.1.

Electronic Flight Information Systems
Figure 22.1 Multi-crew EFIS units and signal interfacing
Display Units
The display units may be Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) or Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). LCDs 
have the advantage of being smaller, and they generate less heat therefore need less cooling. 
The PFD and ND are usually identical units to facilitate spares commonality  and are often 
interchangeable with the systems display units (EICAS or ECAM).
The Colour Display System
There is no set colour standard and so colour displays may vary slightly.
In a typical display system, 5 colours are usually assigned for the display of the many symbols, 
failure annunciators, messages and other alphanumeric information, with a sixth colour (RED) 
for weather (WXR):
WHITE		
Display of present situation information.
GREEN		
Display of present situation information where contrast with white symbols 
is required, or for data having lower priority than white symbols. Engaged 
autoflight modes.
MAGENTA	
All ‘fly to’ information such as flight director commands, deviation pointers, 
active flight path lines.

CYAN	 	
Sky shading on an EADI and for low-priority information such as non-active 
flight plan map data.
YELLOW	
Ground shading  on  an  EADI,  caution information display such as failure 
warning flags, limit and alert annunciators and fault messages.
RED	
	
For display of heaviest precipitation levels as detected by the weather radar 
(WXR).
The Remote Light Sensor
The Remote Light Sensor is a photodiode device which responds to ambient light conditions on 
the flight deck, and automatically adjusts the brightness of the CRT displays to an acceptable 
level.
The Control Panel
A control panel is provided for each system, and typically, as shown in Figure 22.2, the switches 
are grouped for the purpose of controlling the displays of their respective EADI and EHSI units.

This displays the selected decision  height 
on the controller, and on the EADI.
The ‘EADI’ Display Presentation
The ‘EADI’ (Figure 22.3) displays normal pitch and roll attitude indications plus
•	 Attitude data from an Inertial Reference System (IRS)
•	 Flight director commands
•	 Localizer and glide slope deviation
•	 Ground speed
•	 Radio altitude
•	 Decision height
•	 Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) and Autothrottle modes
•	 Speed error scale (Difference between commanded and actual)
Note:	 The autoland status, pitch, roll-armed and engage modes are selected on the AFCS 
control panel.
Decision Height (DH)
Decision height is the wheel height above the runway elevation by which a go-around must be 
initiated unless adequate visual reference has been established and the aircraft position and 
approach path have been assessed as satisfactory to continue the approach and landing in 
safety.

Decision height and radio altimeter presentation below 1000 ft
At Decision Height
Figure 22.4 
Radio altitude on Boeing-based systems is digitally displayed during when the aircraft is 
between 2500 ft and 1000 ft above ground level.
Below 1000 ft the display automatically changes to a white circular scale calibrated in increments 
of 100 ft, and the selected decision height is then displayed as a magenta-coloured marker on 
the outer scale. The radio altitude also appears within the scale as a digital read-out. As the 
aircraft descends, segments of the altitude scale are simultaneously erased so that the scale 
continuously diminishes in length in an anticlockwise direction.

Electronic Flight Information Systems
On the descent, at decision height plus about 50 ft, an aural alert chime sounds at an increasing 
rate until decision height is reached.
On reaching DH the marker and scale flash and change from magenta to amber or yellow. 
Pressing the EADI control panel DH RST button will cancel the alert chime, stop the marker 
flashing and change the DH displays back to their normal colour.
Deviation beyond normal localizer and glide slope limits cause the scales to change colour to 
amber and the pointer to flash, which ceases if the aircraft returns to within limits.
Note: The A300 system currently in use differs from the above by using digital read-out only. 
This system, which is also found on some other aircraft types, displays Rad Alt at the base of 
the PFD centre display using green numbers above decision height and amber, slightly bigger 
numbers below (see Figure 22.3). The digital read-out is enhanced by a voice warning system 
which will give aural indications of height passing to the pilot. The aural warnings will be given

Map Mode
Figure 22.10 
The mode used normally is the MAP display, which, in conjunction with the flight plan data 
programmed into a flight management computer, displays information against a moving map 
background with all elements to a common scale.
The symbol representing the aircraft is at the lower part of the display, and an arc of the 
compass scale, or rose, covering 45 degrees on either side of the instantaneous track, is at the 
upper part of the display.
Heading information is supplied by the appropriate inertial reference system and the compass 
rose is automatically referenced to magnetic north (via a crew-operated MAG/TRUE selector 
switch) when between latitudes 73°N and 65°S, and to true north when above these latitudes. 
When the selector switch is set at TRUE the compass rose is referenced to true north regardless 
of latitude.
The aircraft active route as derived from the FMC is shown as a magenta coloured line joining 
the waypoints. The active waypoint (the one the aircraft is currently navigating towards) is 
shown as a magenta coloured star. The other waypoints making up the active route are called 
inactive waypoints and are shown as a white star. Both are identified by name.
Distance to next waypoint and time at next waypoint are shown at the top of the display 
Weather radar (WXR) return data and range arcs are displayed when the WXR switch is on. 
Turbulence mode (+T) may be available as previously described.
Indications of other data such as wind speed and direction, lateral and vertical deviations from 
the selected flight path are also displayed.
The flight management computer (FMC) can predict events by combining current ground speed 
and lateral acceleration to show a display of either a curved trend vector, white, (during turns) 
or a range to altitude arc, green,  (during climb or descent). Off route waypoints, airports, nav 
aids can all be shown in their relative position to the aircraft’s progress and selected range. 
Additional waypoint information can be displayed when selected: altitude, time etc.

Plan Mode
Figure 22.11 
In ‘PLAN’ mode a static map background is used with active route data orientated to true 
north.  Any changes to the route may be selected at the keyboard of the flight management 
computer, and the display shown on the EHSI, so they can be checked before they are entered 
into the FMC.
The top portion of the EHSI remains the same as in the map mode.
This mode allows the pilot to review the planned route by using the FMC / CDU LEGS page.
Weather radar display data is inhibited.
No wind speed or direction information is shown
Students should be aware that the arc of compass shown is “real time”. The planning section 
below this is north orientated. The heading from TOBIX to LOGAN is approximately 020°, NOT 
155°.
Data Source Selection
In the type of system described earlier, means are provided whereby the pilots can 
independently of each other, connect their respective display units to alternate sources of input 
data through a data source switch panel, e.g. the left or right Air Data Computer (ADC), the 
Flight Management Computers (FMC), the Flight Control Computers (FCC), and the Standby 
Inertial Reference Systems (IRS).

Failure Annunciation
The failure of data signals from such systems as the ILS and radio altimeter is displayed on each 
EADI and EHSI in the form of yellow flags ‘painted’ at specific matrix locations on their CRT 
screens.
In addition, fault messages may also be displayed, for example, if the associated  flight 
management computer and weather radar range disagree with the control panel range data, 
the discrepancy message ‘WXR/MAP RANGE DISAGREE’ appears on the EHSI.
Navigation Displays
The following symbols can be displayed on each HSI depending on EFI Control Panel switch 
selection. Symbols can be displayed with different colours but the general colour presentation 
is as follows:

Computers
A computer may be defined as: A device or set of devices that can store data and a program 
that operates on the data.  A general purpose computer can be programmed to solve any 
reasonable problem expressed in logical and arithmetical terms.
The first fully operational general purpose computer, electromechanical and using binary 
digits, was the Z3, built in Germany in 1941 by Konrad Zuse.
Basically there are two types of computer:
•	 Analogue
•	 Digital
By far the most common is the digital computer or microprocessor which now plays a part in 
most aspects of everyday life.
Analogue Computers
An analogue computer uses continuous physical variables such as voltage or pressure to 
represent and manipulate the measurements it handles.
Analogue computers are used as electronic models or analogues of mechanical or other systems 
in cases where conducting experiments on the system itself would be costly, time consuming 
or dangerous.  For example when designing a bridge or aircraft wing or any structure where 
motion can occur, the engineer must know beforehand how it will react to various physical 
variables such as wind speed and temperature.
In recent years analogue computers have become less popular because it is now possible to 
program digital computers to simulate moving physical systems.
The remainder of this chapter will deal with digital computers and their use in aircraft.
Digital Computers
Digital computers use digital data (binary data) in their operations.  This form of data has only 
two levels of voltage as opposed to the analogue system’s continuous variables.  The two levels 
correspond to ON or OFF i.e. switching circuits. Digital circuits are two state circuits.  Normally 
when working on paper we count from zero to nine - the decimal number system.  When the 
digital computer works it has to use the ON - OFF, two state or BINARY number system.

Digital Computer Components (Hardware)
Having discussed the language in which computers work, and remembering that binary is the 
basic language in which calculations are carried out and information is stored in memory, we 
shall now look at the construction of a basic computer.
All computers have the basic components shown in the diagram below:
Figure 23.1 A basic digital computer Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The CPU performs, organizes and controls all the operations the computer can carry out.  It 
is really the brain of the computer.  What the CPU can do is controlled by an instruction set.
The CPU itself consists of:
•	 Arithmetic  Logic  Unit:  The  ALU  performs  arithmetic  calculations and logical operations 
in the binary number system.
•	 Shift  Registers: The shift registers are temporary stores;  one of them, called the accumulator 
contains the data actually being processed.
•	 Control  Unit: The control unit contains the computer’s clock.  This is a crystal controlled 
oscillator which generates timing pulses at a fixed frequency, typically between 120 and 
45 MHz.  This synchronizes computer operations.
Input Output Devices
The CPU accepts digital signals from the input devices: keyboard, mouse or modem, in the case 
of a PC, via its input port.  In an aircraft these could be various sensors: Rad Alt, Baro Alt, TAS, 
fuel flow, etc.
After processing these are fed out via its output port to a Visual Display Unit (Monitor) or 
printer.  In an aircraft the output may be fed to an EFIS Symbol Generator or the FMS Control 
and Display Unit (CDU).

Basic Computers
BIOS (Basic Input Output System) converts the input signals to a form the computer can 
work with and converts the outputs to a form the operator or another aircraft system can 
understand.
Memory
Working Memory:  A computer needs a working memory to run the programme of instructions 
(software) it has to execute.  If the programme is fixed as in a computer controlled piece of 
equipment, the memory only has to be read. To do this a Read Only Memory  (ROM)  is  used. 
This  ROM  is  programmed  by  the  manufacturer.  A Programmable Read Only Memory 
(PROM), Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM), or Electronically Erasable 
Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) would be used if the user wanted to construct 
or modify the programme himself and keep it permanently in the memory.
Memory that retains data when the power is switched off is called NON-VOLATILE MEMORY. 
Memory that loses data in the event of a power failure or switch off is called VOLATILE 
MEMORY.
If the programme has to be changed during operation, then the memory must be able to be 
written to as well as read.  To do this Random Access Memory (RAM) is used. This allows 
instructions to be written in, read out and altered at will.  A RAM is also required to store the 
data for processing as this also will change continually.  RAM is normally volatile memory.
Permanent Memory: As stated above RAM is volatile and work is lost when power is removed. 
Permanent storage for computer programs, and the work they generate, may be stored in 3 
different ways. 
•	 Electronic chip.  Solid state memory, often known as “Flash Memory”. Very fast access and 
re-writable. They may be re-written indefinitely.
•	 Optical Disk.  Compact discs (CDs) read with a laser. These may be either read only or re-
writable, but there will only be a very limited number of times they can be re-written.
•	 Magnetic Disk. These may be internal, external or removable. They may be re-written 
indefinitely. The internal “hard drive” on a computer is traditionally a magnetic disk. 
Removable “floppy disks” are now virtually obsolete.
Software
Assembly Language
A low-level programming language for computers, and other programmable devices. It is a 
symbolic representation of the machine codes, and other constants, needed to program a 
given CPU.
The code is usually defined by the hardware manufacturer.

High Level Language
An advanced computer programming language that is not limited by the computer, or for one 
specific job, and is more easily understood by the author than an assembly language. Examples 
of high level languages are:
•	 FORTRAN
•	 ALGOL
•	 BASIC
•	 C++
Scripting Language
A programming language that allows control of one or more applications. “Scripts” are distinct 
from the core code of the application, and apply to a specific program only. They are usually 
written in a different language (similar to Basic) and are often created or at least modified by 
the end-user.
Specification for Software Used in Aircraft
To enable a flight to be conducted safely it is vital that any computer software must be safe to 
use and free of any errors that could endanger the flight. To this end a specification has been 
agreed to which all aircraft related software must comply. This is known as EUROCAE ED12B. 
There are 5 levels of software defined. The level required will depend upon the application. 
For example the galley oven controller could accept a major failure without endangering the 
aircraft, whereas any failure within the Flight Control Computer could be dangerous to the 
flight.

Basic Computers
Aircraft Systems 
Systems which are computer controlled include:
•	 Flight Management System (FMS)
•	 Digital Flight Guidance System (DFGS)
•	 Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)
•	 Traffic Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)
Of course fly-by-wire aircraft take computer control very much further, when the whole flight 
envelope is controlled by computer process with inputs from the crew when necessary.
Current design favours the use of dedicated computers for each separate system.  In the future, 
however, we may see sharing of computer power in the form of an Integrated Hazard Warning 
System (IHWS).  Here a powerful central processor, with appropriate back-up, handles inputs 
from the stall warning system, windshear detection, GPWS, TCAS and even the Weather Radar, 
processes the information and prioritizes warnings to the crew.
Analogue to Digital Conversion (A to D)
Many aircraft sensors produce analogue information in the form of varying voltages, pressures, 
temperatures, etc. Of course digital computers use digital (binary) information and a device 
called an Analogue to Digital Converter is required in the interface between the sensor and 
the computer input device.
Digital to Analogue Conversion (D to A)
When a digital computer has to pass information to an analogue device the process is reversed 
and a Digital to Analogue Converter is used.

Introduction 
Currently aircraft are controlled using voice communications. Over and close to populated 
landmasses, ATC use radar to provide positive control of aircraft with VHF communications. 
However, over oceans, deserts and polar regions VHF, and radar, may not be available and ATC 
will have to provide a procedural control service, which generally requires HF communications, 
resulting in high vertical, lateral and longitudinal separation distances, resulting in a low traffic 
density. 
Position reports are passed by aircraft crossing the North Atlantic every 10° of longitude 
up to 70°N and every 20° north thereof, which means ATC receive a position update every 
30 - 60 minutes. With the increase in international air traffic this is posing major limitations, 
compounded by the difficulties associated with HF communications which means that in these 
remote areas the pilot is rarely communicating directly with the ATC controller but rather 
through a third party who relays messages between the two. 
Over and around populated areas radar allows positive identification and control of aircraft. 
The need to increase capacity over the rest of the world requires that ATC have real time 
information on the aircraft positions, which must have improved accuracy, and better 
communications between the air traffic controller and the pilot. 
The advances in technology mean we now have global satellite navigation systems (GNSS) 
providing position accuracy to better than one NM. Although there are still some issues on 
the service provided by GNSS, in general this high level of position accuracy is now globally 
achievable. Satellite communication systems (SATCOM) are also available giving the potential 
for global communications through a single medium. 
Communications Systems 
Until the late 1980s communications with ATC and the air operators was only achievable using 
VHF and HF voice communications. VHF communications are line of sight and therefore only 
available over and in the near vicinity of habitable areas and are limited to about 200 NM from 
the transmitter for aircraft at FL300. Outside these areas communications have to be effected 
using HF. HF is notoriously difficult to use, having high levels of static interference with fading 
of signals which leads to messages being repeated and/or relayed through other aircraft. This 
means that a third party communicates with the aircraft and relays messages between the 
ATC controller and the pilot. Because of the stressful nature of these communications, the 
pilot does not maintain a continuous listening watch but is alerted by a selective calling system 
(SELCAL) which is activated by the communicator when there is a message for the aircraft. 
In the 1990s voice communications were extended to SATCOM (using UHF frequencies) via 
geostationary satellites. Because geostationary satellites can only be positioned above the 
equator, coverage is limited to about 80° of latitude. To provide a service in polar regions it is 
intended to use satellites in lower altitude orbits with the orbits inclined such that polar regions 
will have a full SATCOM service.

Disadvantages of Voice Communications
•	 Many a/c on one frequency
•	 Synchronous transmission
•	 Language confusion 
•	 Limited channels
•	 VHF  -  line of sight only
•	 HF    -  Interference, tiring to listen to
	
Data Link 
To overcome many of the problems with voice communications, data link services have been 
developed.
A data link is a means of connecting one location to another, for the purpose of transmitting 
and receiving information. Data links may be established on any frequency, but will require 
additional equipment on both the ground and the aircraft.

Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) 
ACARS uses data link format to pass messages between the aircraft and ATC or aircraft operating 
companies using VHF, and the messages can be printed out in the cockpit. In the early 1990s 
this service was extended to SATCOM for flights outside VHF coverage using geostationary 
satellites. The gap in polar regions was closed in 2001 by extending the service to HF. 
In the 1990s interfaces with the FMS were developed which allowed operational data, for 
example meteorological information and alternate flight plan routes, to be evaluated using the 
FMS. Maintenance functions were also added to allow independent monitoring of the aircraft 
systems. This is implemented through ATSU/DCDU (Air Traffic Service Unit/Data link Cockpit 
Display Unit). 
Air Traffic Service Unit (ATSU)
The ATCSU is able to provide the following services to aircraft:
•	 Flight Information Service
•	 Alerting Service
•	 Air Traffic Advisory Service
•	 Air Traffic Control Service
•	 Area
•	 Approach
•	 Aerodrome
Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Systems/Air Traffic 
Management (CNS/ATM)
CNS/ATM is designed to use various levels of automation, digital technology and satellite 
systems to give a Seamless Global Air Traffic Management System.
Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Systems refer to the facilities offered by an ATSU.
Air Traffic Management refers to the facilities offered by an Aircraft Operational Centre (AOC). 
This is basically the airline, or company, operating the aircraft.

Logon 
To gain access to the data link service the pilot must perform a manual logon. This requires the 
pilot to input the four digit ICAO address for the ATSU into the FMS which then sends the logon 
message to the ATSU. The logon message includes the aircraft address and information on the 
services the aircraft equipment supports. The ATSU acknowledges the logon message then 
sends a connection request message to the aircraft. The aircraft responds with a connection 
confirm message and the process is complete. This known as the ATS facilities notification 
(AFN). 
This initial logon is performed on first contact with the ATSU on the ground, when entering an 
area with CPDLC from a non-CPDLC area and if there has been any interruption to the service 
(that is if the link is broken). Once the service is established the equipment will perform an 
automatic transfer to subsequent CPDLC capable ATSUs. 
The message from the aircraft to the ATSU is always referred to as the downlink (DL) message, 
and from the ATSU to the aircraft as the uplink (UL) message even if the aircraft is on the 
ground. 
Future Air Navigation Systems (FANS) 
The aim of FANS is to provide an integrated air traffic control system in areas where radar is 
not available by using GNSS to define aircraft position with data link and voice communications 
through geostationary and lower orbit satellites providing global coverage to ATC centres. 
This will provide ATC with continuous information on the aircraft positions and direct pilot 
to controller communications. When in operation this will allow separation distances to be 
significantly reduced, and if position accuracy is degraded for any reason, the aircraft still have 
TCAS to warn of any potential conflict. 
There are two systems established to give the required global coverage: FANS A and FANS B.
FANS A 
FANS A provides a communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) system and an automatic 
dependent surveillance system (ADS). Communications utilize current frequency allocations in 
HF, VHF and GNSS provide the navigation input for the surveillance. Currently it is used by 
some AOCs to monitor the progress of aircraft at all stages of flight. So, for example, the 
aircraft system will automatically inform the AOC of gate departure, take-off, landing and gate 
arrival. In-flight progress and the operation of on-board systems can also be monitored and, 
where necessary, messages can be passed to alert/assist the crew when potential problems are 
detected. FANS A is used over oceanic and remote airspace, and is transmitted over the ACARS 
network, operated by ARINC.

The components of the FANS A system are:
AFN:	
ATS Facility Notification
A contact message initiated by aircrew, or an automatic trigger within the aircraft.
If acknowledgement has not been received within a pre-set time or there is an 
erroneous reply, then an error message must be displayed to the aircrew.
ADS:	
Automatic Dependent Surveillance
Controller set-up contract (ADS-C) with an aircraft’s FMS, without any pilot input, 
using automated and customized reports.
The flight crew have no workload associated with this set-up.
	
The types of contract available are:
	
	
Periodic
	
	
On Demand
	
	
On Event
	
	
Emergency Mode
	
	
	
Only the flight crew can declare and cancel ADS-C emergency reporting.
	
	
	
Note: Flight crew can initiate the emergency mode. But the aircraft cannot initiate a contract
CPDLC:	CPDLC permits data link messages to be generated for all stages of flight. The messages 
have a fixed format defined within the FMS and ATSU computers and are activated by 
the ATC controller or pilot either as an instruction or response to a request. The messages 
are annotated according to whether a response is required or not. For example if the 
pilot is instructed to report levelling at FL310 then the message will remain open until 
the aircraft reaches FL310 when the FMS will send the response. The confirmation that 
the aircraft is at FL310 does not require a response from the controller, so the message 
will automatically close once received at the ground station.

FANS B 
FANS B is very similar to FANS A but operates within High Density airspace having good VHF 
coverage. 
FANS B is operated over the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN), which is 
operated by SITA.
The ATN is an internetwork architecture that allows ground/ground, ground/air and avionic 
data subnetworks to inter-operate.

Flight Director Systems
Introduction
The Flight Director System (FDS) was originally developed as an aid used by the pilot during 
landing. The FDS provides a pilot with steering and attitude signals on one instrument which 
helps reduce his workload. As autopilots became more advanced the signals produced by the 
FDS could be coupled to the autopilot allowing it to perform more complex tasks.
With an FDS, information about the attitude, heading and flight path of an aircraft, can be 
integrated with navigation information to produce either easy to interpret visual instructions 
for the pilot and/or input to the autopilot, or both.
To bring the terminology of FDS and autopilot together it is usual to describe the FDS as having 
2 “channels”. The first channel is the roll channel, the second is the pitch channel. You will 
learn more about channels in the autopilot section.
Information for the FDS can come from several possible sources:
•	 Pitot-Static system or Air Data Computer (ADC).
•	 VHF Nav receiver allowing input from VOR beacons or Instrument Landing System.
•	 Flight Management System, Inertial Navigation/Reference System.
The FDS also requires attitude and directional information. On older, electromechanical systems 
this would come from the gyro-magnetic compass and a vertical gyro system. More modern 
aircraft use Inertial Navigation/Reference System (INS/IRS) information in place of a vertical 
gyro and will be able to feed the navigation data from these systems into the FDS/Autopilot 
combination.

Flight Director System Components 
There follows a description of a “typical modern” FDS: 
Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI)
This is a fairly standard artificial horizon providing pitch and roll information and gives the 
Attitude to the name of the instrument. The Director part comes from the instruments ability 
to display demand information from the flight director system using Flight Director Command 
Bars. These come in 2 main forms as shown below.
Both of the indications for these apparently different displays are intuitive and essentially the 
same in that the pilot is required to “fly to” either the point where the “wires” cross, or the 
point between the wedges, in order to satisfy the demand from the FDS.

Primary Flight Display (PFD)
The PFD is part of an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) display and brings all of the 
information required to fly the aircraft onto one display. It has an EADI normally surrounded 
by speed, altitude and vertical speed tapes and often a compass display incorporating some 
minimal navigation information. It also has an area which is used for annunciating flight 
director, autopilot and autothrottle modes and status, known as the Flight Mode Annunciator 
(FMA).

Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI)
You may already be familiar with the gyro-magnetic compass. An HSI is a gyro-magnetic compass 
display with a Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) bar, a series of dots representing deviation in 
degrees (the scale varies with the type of display), a from/to pointer, a selected course window 
and a DME display of range. A heading bug is also included. In older systems the course selection 
is done directly on the HSI using an attached knob. The system we will refer to uses a remote 
centralized FD mode control and AP panel called the Autoflight Mode Control Panel (AMCP 
or simply MCP). The system we will be referring to also uses a Navigational Display (ND). This, 
like the PFD, is a more flexible display but is able to show “classical” representations of an HSI.

Flight Director Systems
Flight Director Computer (FDC)
This is where all the information is gathered and processed. On older aircraft this information 
could be in the form of analogue outputs from the ADC and VG. Current systems will be purely 
digital. Older aircraft that have been refitted may have analogue inputs to a digital converter 
so that modern displays and autopilot systems can be used. Outputs from here are sent to the 
symbol generators for the EADI/EHSI and/or the autopilot as required.
Optional Components
FDS use other components depending on what generation they belong to:
Instrument Amplifier or Symbol Generator
Where information is required to be displayed on electromechanical instruments the signals 
require amplification to drive the associated motors. On EFIS fitted aircraft the FDC output can 
be fed directly to the symbol generators for the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and Navigational 
Display (ND) units.
Vertical Gyro or INS/IRS
In older or smaller aircraft types, normally without any INS/IRS, reference to the vertical for 
the Artificial Horizon part of the ADI is provided by a remote vertical gyro system. This simply 
means that the gyro that acts as the artificial horizon is not contained in the instrument in the 
panel in front of the pilot but can be anywhere on the aircraft (normally near the C of G). The 
information derived from it is fed to motors that drive the display of the ADI. The benefits of 
this system are that the gyro can be near the aircraft’s C of G and therefore provide a more 
accurate display of the attitude of the aircraft, and this data in electrical form can be fed to any 
other items requiring attitude information e.g. the autopilot.
More modern and larger aircraft may use data from their INS or IRS to replace that normally 
provided by a VG as the INS is simply a more modern and much more sensitive version of a gyro.
Mode Controller or Mode Control Panel (MCP)
The mode controller allows the pilot to change the mode of the FDS, alter the pitch trim and 
switch the FDS display on or off as required. The modes available depend on the fit of the 
aircraft. On modern aircraft the MCP, on which most of the information for the autopilot is 
programmed, is used to replace the separate FD mode controller. Typical modes and the pitch 
trim will be discussed a little later. The MCP will also be described in more detail later.
Figure 25.6 
Mode Annunciators / Indicators or PFD Flight Mode Annunciators (FMA)
These are a series of simple lights, magnetic indicators or a small panel of illuminated indicators 
that show the pilot what mode or phase of a particular mode the FDS / autopilot is in. In 
more basic systems the most common indications are during an ILS approach. These panels are 
usually only powered with the FD switch on.

When the aircraft is awaiting capture of the localizer, the LOC (localizer) light will typically 
be amber. When the localizer has been captured the light will change to a green LOC light. 
Approaching the glide slope the GS light will be amber and again will change to green to 
indicate the fact that the FDS has locked on to the GS.
More capable systems will have more functions and consequently more lights, such as those 
indicating the state of the autothrottle and flare or go-around modes.
EFIS equipped aircraft display the appropriate information on the PFD/EADI in an area called 
the Flight Mode Annunciator. As the same space can be used for all the different messages, 
it can be kept small. Here all the modes for the FD autothrottle and autopilot are displayed. 
Newly changed information is often emphasized on the FMA type display by surrounding it in 
a box. Engaged modes are shown on the top line in green while armed modes are on the line 
below in white.
Flight Director Modes
As has been said the modes for each system vary. The modes described now are the most 
common but not all may be available depending on aircraft fit.
First it must be appreciated that there is a distinction in the way data is displayed to the 
pilot. The glide slope indicator to the side of the ADI and the CDI bar are what is termed raw 
information. That is the information is not processed in any way and simply indicates that the 
aircraft is left or right of track / localizer, or above or below the glide slope and knowledge of 
the system will tell you by how many degrees.
In order to anticipate turns, climbs and descents for smooth flying the FDS can use the raw 
data, compute and signal commands to either the pilot via the flight director bars or directly 
to the autopilot. This is called computed information and is derived from the rate of change 
of deviation of the incoming signal. As the rate of change of deviation from the desired track 
increases, the FDS computes that in order to intercept the track correctly, rather than fly 
straight through, it must indicate a turn onto track.
This becomes important if the FDS fails as, although the computed information will no longer 
be reliable / available, the raw information may still be available and used.
Many of the FD modes are common with the autopilot modes. We have detailed the FD modes 
in the following sections. Where they are similar to the autopilot mode the description is fairly 
basic with the full description being found in the autopilot chapter. Where the FD mode differs 
from the autopilot mode the description will detail the differences.
FD Fail Indications
Before going on to discuss the modes individually we need to know how the FDS informs 
us if the information it is giving is reliable. On electromechanical displays warning flags are 
used. If the vertical gyro or other vertical referencing system fails or its power supply fails 
then a “Gyro” warning flag will pop into view, normally on the ADI. Failures of the FDC, the 
instrument amplifier, or the ADI itself, are indicated by a flag labelled either “ATT” for attitude 
or “FD”. This will normally again be on the ADI display.
If glide slope information is unreliable, due to poor signal strength or failure of the system, a 
“GS” flag will appear in front of the raw glide slope scale where it appears, either to the side 
of the ADI or the HSI.

Poor reception, unreliable or loss of VOR, LNAV or LOC information is indicated by a “NAV” 
flag, normally located on the HSI.
The HSI will have a power failure flag to indicate loss of power to the instrument or the compass 
gyro. It will also indicate if the compass system is operating in Directional Gyro (DG) mode i.e. 
the magnetic reference has been lost and the compass is now essentially a DI.
Command attitude changes
When flying level the pilot selects an attitude that, for the given airspeed, will achieve level 
flight. With the aircraft at low airspeed the pitch angle will be several degrees nose-up to avoid 
descending. As an aid to keeping a constant pitch angle the FD command bars can be offset 
vertically to provide an intuitive aiming point for the pilot.
This can also be used for keeping constant pitch angles for climbing and descending. The 
movement of the bars is achieved by moving the Pitch Trim knob or wheel (dependent on age 
of design) until the command bars are in the desired position. The pitch trim system is inhibited 
whenever any other pitch mode is active.
Flight Director Take-off Mode
Initially both flight director systems should be switched on prior to starting the take-off roll. 
The FD take-off mode is engaged by pressing either of the TO/GA switches on the throttles. 
The AFDS annunciation is “TO/GA”. The initial FD commands are for 10 degrees nose-down 
pitch and wings level. At 60 kt IAS, the FD command changes to 15 degrees nose-up and wings 
level.
To engage the FD system during the take-off even if the FD switches are off press the TO/GA 
button after 80 kt IAS but before 2000’ or 150 seconds after lift-off and the command bars will 
automatically appear.
The FD provides pitch commands after lift-off. It continues to command 15 degrees nose-up 
pitch until sufficient climb rate is achieved. It then commands pitch to maintain the MCP speed 
plus 20 kt IAS; this speed is calculated and set during the pre flight. Next, when either autopilot 
is engaged or when the MCP speed selector is rotated, 20 kt IAS is added automatically to the 
MCP IAS display.
FD roll commands wings level from take-off mode engagement through to the take-off climb-
out. To terminate the take-off mode below 400’ RA, both of the FD switches must be turned 
off. Above 400’ RA, the take-off mode can be terminated by selecting other FD pitch modes or 
by engaging an autopilot.
Engaging an autopilot after a FD take-off automatically engages the autopilot and FD in LVL 
CHG (level change) for pitch and HDG SEL (heading select) for roll. If the FD mode had been 
changed from TO/GA to LNAV, HDG SEL or VOR/LOC, the autopilot initially engages in the 
same roll mode as the FDs. When LVL CHG engages, the MCP IAS/MACH display and airspeed 
cursors change to V2 + 20 kt.
If an engine fails during take-off before reaching V2 speed, the FD pitch commands are 
referenced to V2. If the engine failure occurs after reaching V2, but less than V2 + 20 kt, the 
reference speed is that at which the engine failure occurred. If the failure occurs at or above 
V2 + 20 kt, V2 + 20 kt is the commanded speed. Reference speed is never less than V2 for the 
current flap setting. Roll control remains the same as for all engines operating.

Altitude Acquire / Altitude Hold
In the cruise we require to fly at a constant level. The FDS can be used to help achieve this. 
Signals from the ADC through the FDS mean that when we are at the selected level, the FD 
command bars indicate a neutral position. If the aircraft were to deviate above the desired 
altitude the command bars would indicate a pitch down command and vice versa.

Navigation Modes
Heading Mode
In this mode VOR beacons and various internal navigation systems can be linked to either 
display information using the FDS or linked to the autopilot or both.
The simplest nav mode is to have the aircraft keep flying in the direction you select. This is 
called Heading Mode. In this mode the pilot selects a desired heading, either using a knob on 
the HSI, using the central FDS/autopilot panel or on the MCP. The FDS will now indicate a fly 
to command to bring the aircraft on to the desired heading.
LOC/ VOR (LNAV)
This selection allows VOR, Localizer or INS/IRS/FMS(GPS) nav information to be fed and 
displayed on the FDS. In the case of the VOR, after tuning and correctly identifying the station 
to be used, with VOR/LOC selected on the mode selector and the desired track to (or from) the 
beacon set in the course selection widow (using either on the HSI, MCP or the CDU), the FDS 
will give appropriate steering command to intercept and then maintain track.
Intercepting the LOC is very similar but will be discussed in more detail later.
With aircraft being fitted with more accurate navigation systems it is only logical that this 
information should be made available to the pilot and autopilot. INS/IRS/FMS/GPS information 
can be selected for display in very much the same way as the VOR information and is represented 
in the same way.
Note that because the actual track of the aircraft is being compared with the desired track, 
and the flight director commands are given to fly the desired track, the flight director system 
will effectively compensate for drift. There is no need for wind velocity information (although 
the INS could provide it), it is purely an effect of the flight director giving commands to fly the 
desired course/track selected.
Flight Director Approaches (FDA)
The ILS frequency is tuned into the VHF nav radios and identified and the QDM for the approach 
is set up in the course window. The mode selector should be set to AUTO/APP. The annunciator 
will show that the FDS is looking to capture the LOC. After beam capture, in a similar manner 
to VOR tracking the FDS will (given enough distance) arrange the intercept to establish on the 
localizer with a turn demand and the annunciator panel will indicate LOC capture.
The FDS is now looking for the glide slope signal and so the annunciator GS light or magnetic 
indicator will indicate such. As soon as the glide slope is captured the annunciator changes 
again and the FDS will indicate a pitch nose down demand to fly the ILS glide slope.
If the interception of the localizer has been misjudged it is possible to end up established on 
the localizer past the point of GS intercept i.e. above the glideslope. Modern systems may 
automatically adjust and capture from above by increasing the rate of descent. On older aircraft 
it was sometime possible to temporarily switch the FDS mode to MAN/GS. This forces the FDS 
into accepting a capture from above. It can also be used to establish a fixed intercept angle of 
the LOC beam and to force a LOC or GS capture condition if it is known that the beam- sensing 
circuits of the computer are inoperative.

FD Go-around (GA)
For the 737-400 series of a/c 2 criteria must be met before the FD can engage in the GA mode. 
The FD switches can be either on or off and:
In-flight below 2000’ RA and not in the TO mode
TO/GA switch pressed
After engaging in GA, command bars appear for both pilots, TO/GA is annunciated for the FD 
pitch mode, the MCP IAS/MACH display blanks and the Airspeed Cursors display manoeuvring 
speed for the existing flap setting.
Below 400’ RA, both of the FD switches must be turned from ON to OFF to exit the FD GA 
mode. Above 400’ RA, other pitch and roll modes can be selected. If the roll mode is changed 
first, the FD pitch mode remains in the GA mode. If the pitch mode is changed first, the FD roll 
mode automatically changes to HDG SEL.
Engaging an A/P following a FD GA automatically engages both the A/P and FD in LVL CHG 
and HDG SEL for pitch and roll respectively.
For a 2-engine GA the FD commands a 15 degrees nose-up pitch and roll to hold the approach 
ground track at the time of engagement. After reaching a programmed rate of climb, pitch 
commands hold the manoeuvring speed for each flap setting.
During a single-engine GA the FD pitch command is initially to 13 degrees nose-up but as climb 
rate increases, FD pitch commands maintain a target speed. Roll commands are the same as for 
the 2-engine case. If engine failure occurs prior to GA engagement, then MCP selected speed 
becomes the target speed. If the engine failure occurs after GA engagement, then FD target 
speed depends on whether 10 seconds have elapsed since GA engagement:
•	 If prior to 10 seconds, the MCP selected approach speed becomes the target speed.
•	 If after 10 seconds and the airspeed at engine failure is within 5 kt of the GA engagement 
speed, the airspeed that existed at the GA engagement becomes the target speed.
•	 If after 10 seconds and the airspeed at engine failure is more than 5 kt above GA engagement 
speed, then the current airspeed becomes the target airspeed.
In all cases, the GA target speed is not less than V2 speed based on flap position unless in 
windshear conditions.
The FD target speed is displayed on the MCP and by the airspeed cursors. No commanded 
acceleration can occur until a higher speed is selected on the MCP.
FD Manoeuvre Protection
Because the modern FDC is configured for each particular aircraft type it will have the aircraft 
performance parameters stored in its memory. As it has inputs from the ADC and other systems 
it can ensure that it never commands a manoeuvre which will overstress the aircraft. This is 
the beginning of the systems used for protection in aircraft with fly-by-wire controls (discussed 
fully in another chapter).

Flight Director Systems
Flight Director Gain Scheduling
Gain scheduling is the varying of the gain of the pitch and roll demands of the FDC in relation 
to the task. This has many parallels with autopilot gain scheduling or gain adaption. The FD 
mode of operation using gain scheduling is the FDA. As the approach progresses the glide 
slope beam converges with the runway (which is how it works and what we want). The ILS 
works as a beam set at a certain angle diverging from the runway, normally about 3 degrees. 
ILS equipment displays that received signal as an error in degrees from the ideal.
At 6 NM one degree of error equates to about 608 ft of vertical distance. At ½ NM that same 
one degree of error equates to about 54 ft of vertical distance. It should be obvious that 
although the indications on the raw ILS glide slope will be the same, a less forceful correction is 
required as the aircraft nears the ILS transmitter. So the FD computed pitch information must 
be modified as the approach progresses to reduce the commanded corrections.
As the aircraft approaches touch-down the magnitude of the pitch changes required to follow 
GS reduce. Gain scheduling reduces the magnitude of the commands as the aircraft proceeds 
on the FDA. So initially the FDS can demand manoeuvres almost to the full authority of the 
system. As the threshold approaches, however, the gain is reduced to perhaps a ½ or ⅓  of the 
original value.
The initiation of this scheduling can come in many forms depending on the age of the system: 
Early systems simply used time e.g. 45 seconds after GS capture the gain is reduced.
 The next systems used the marker beacons to try to actually match the scheduling required to 
the approach being flown. This system has fallen into disuse however because of the loss of the 
marker beacon systems at many airfields.

Radio Altimeter
This relies on no ground signals and gives accurate scheduling in relation to actual aircraft 
height. This also means that the actual scheduling can be phased in gradually as opposed to 
the stepped method of the timing or marker systems.
Gain scheduling or adaption can be made to occur for any change in the flight regime to 
reduce the demands from the flight director to ensure adequate safety.
Dual FDS
When, as on large aircraft, 2 FDS are fitted (one for each pilot), each system can be used to 
monitor the indications of the other. This system is the FD Comparator or Monitor.
The FD Comparator monitors command bar positions. The command bars are removed when 
a difference is sensed between the 2 FDS of approximately 1 to 4 degrees of pitch and/or 3 
to 9 degrees of roll. FD command bars reappear when the difference returns to within limits.
FD comparison is only active during certain modes of FD operation. First, both FD switches 
must be on and neither autopilot engaged. Second, it only operates in either the TOGA or APP 
mode below 800 ft RA.
FD comparison is inhibited for several reasons. It is inhibited on the ground or when either FD 
is affected by electrical bus transfer. Also, it is inhibited by failure of either a FD sensor or an 
FD itself.
Having 2 FDS also means a certain amount of redundancy in the system. It also means that if 
one system should fail, as long as the associated display equipment is serviceable, both sets 
of display can if necessary be run from one FDC. This on electromechanical instruments is 
often simply a switch which, when operated, splits the FDC output from the serviceable FDS 
instrument amplifier and feeds it into both sets of ADIs and HSIs. The flight instrument and FD 
power (and that of navigational information sources) may also be separate to aid redundancy.
EFIS equipped aircraft have a spare symbol generator also to retain extra redundancy.

Autopilot
Introduction
The main purpose of the autopilot is to relieve the pilot of the physical and mental fatigue of 
flying the aircraft, especially during long flights. This will result in the pilot being more alert 
during the critical phase of landing.
Autopilot systems also enable the aircraft to fly a prescribed route accurately due to the 
autopilot’s ability to react quicker than a human pilot to disturbances.
Many different autopilot systems exist offering many different modes of operation and facilities. 
Generally, however, today’s modern airliner, when fitted with an autothrottle system, will have 
the facility to fly the aircraft automatically for almost the entire route. In each such system, 
the autopilot flies the aircraft as it responds to commands from attitude sensors, navigation 
systems, and pitot-static systems. Power is controlled through the engine throttles moved by 
autothrottle servos responding to commands from the thrust management computer.
It should be noted that, as yet, the autopilot does not carry out the take-off which has to done 
by the pilot. The autopilot, though, can be engaged shortly after take-off at about 400 feet or 
possibly even a lower height.
The Autopilot
The basic autopilot has been in existence for about 50 years. It was introduced as an aid to the 
pilot flying the aircraft for 2 major reasons:
Reduction in Workload
Allowing automatic systems to fly the aircraft means that the crew not only are more rested 
for the more demanding phases of flight, but it also allows the pilots to concentrate on other 
tasks such as navigation.
The Response Time
An autopilot is much quicker than a human and as a result it can fly an aircraft more accurately. 
A human pilot takes approximately 1/5 of a second (200 milliseconds) in detecting a change in 
the aircraft’s attitude and then suffers a further delay while deciding which control to apply to 
oppose the disturbance. An autopilot will detect a disturbance and put on the required control 
to correct the disturbance in approximately 50 milliseconds.

Fail Safe Autopilot
With any automatic system it is necessary to protect against malfunctions - in particular, 
runaways. This is achieved either by limiting the authority of the actuator or the rate at which 
the actuator can travel. In this way the pilot should always be able to override the effects of a 
malfunction and retain control of the aircraft in the event of autopilot failure. Such a system 
would be called a fail-safe system and the term applies to any single autopilot.
The Basic Autopilot
The basic autopilot is a very simple system. Understanding of the basic autopilot is essential for 
understanding and explaining what any autopilot is doing throughout the flight.
Aircraft Stabilization
This is the key function for an autopilot (and this is all that some basic autopilots may achieve). 
All the modes such as VOR tracking and altitude hold etc. are “extras”.
Consider an early aircraft design. All that was originally required was a system that would keep 
the aircraft flying in the same attitude once the pilot was happy. He could then concentrate 
on navigation, disengaging the autopilot as necessary to correct headings and so on. To design 
such a system we need to consider the sequence of events that must occur to keep the aircraft’s 
attitude constant. Consider yourself flying a light aircraft, e.g. a Warrior, in slightly turbulent 
conditions. Now consider that the aircraft experiences a disturbance in pitch:
A human pilot controls the aircraft’s stability by sensing a change in aircraft attitude, computing 
the necessary corrective action required and using his muscles to move the flight controls. The 
aircraft then manoeuvres about its centre of gravity back towards its original position. He will 
then sense that corrective action has taken place and move the flight controls back to remove 
the correcting input.
The autopilot is capable of producing the same actions as the pilot to maintain aircraft stability 
in a shorter reaction time. It must detect the disturbance and then work out appropriate 
corrective action. It must then apply that correction using its “muscles” which will cause the 
aircraft to manoeuvre about its centre of gravity back towards its original position. Finally it 
must detect that the correction has taken place and re-centre the controls. This is known as 
inner loop control (or sometimes closed loop or auto-stabilization). In list form it can:
•	 Sense changes in attitude.
•	 Compute the amount and direction of control required.
•	 Provide the muscle to move the control surfaces using servomotors.
•	 Detect that the control has been applied and that the aircraft has responded.
•	 Return control surfaces back to the neutral condition when the disturbance has been 
corrected.
As you will learn in the principles of flight, aircraft will naturally tend to be stable in any case 
so you may wonder why go to the bother of installing this basic autopilot. Yes, aircraft are 
naturally stable but you will learn that there are different type of stability and that stability can 
change with respect to the ambient conditions. The basic autopilot then augments and fine-
tunes this stability to provide enhanced stability over a greater range of ambient conditions.
It must be emphasized that the most basic autopilot available will be of a type that will only 
provide auto-stabilization.

Control Loops
An autopilot is a control system which uses control loops. The inner loop is a classic example of 
a closed loop control system (hence one of its common titles). An outer loop  interacts with the 
inner loop to give the aeroplane guidance so as to achieve the required flight path. The basic 
elements of a closed loop control system are shown in Figure 26.1 and comprise:
•	 Input
•	 Error detector / Signal Processor
•	 Output
•	 Control element
•	 Feedback
Figure 26.1 Closed Loop Control
Figure 26.2 Open Loop Control
Figure 26.2 shows an open loop control system which does not have feedback. The controller 
may consist of a pre-determined programme or a human operator. However, if a human 
operator is used then the system, in effect, becomes a closed loop system with the human 
closing the loop and feeding back the output signals.
The difference between open loop and closed loop systems can be illustrated by the domestic 
central heating system. A system with a timing controller but no thermostat would be an open 
loop system i.e. the pump would continue to send hot water round the house regardless of the 
room temperature for the duration of the period set on the timer control. On the other hand, a 
system with a thermostat would interrupt the circulation when the room temperature reaches 
the preselected level i.e. it has feedback control.
Feedback control systems used for positional control e.g. aircraft flying controls, are usually 
referred to as servo systems or servomechanisms. A servomechanism can be defined as a 
closed loop control system where a small input is converted into a larger output in a strictly 
proportionate manner.

Aircraft Inner Loop Control System
The components of an inner (closed) loop control system in an aircraft shown in Figure 26.3 
are: 
Attitude Sensor
A rate gyro senses disturbance of the aircraft in one axis only.
Transducer
Converts mechanical movement of the gyro into an electrical signal.
Signal Processor
The error detector. Compares the signals from the transducer with the input signals, determines 
the required corrective action (the error) and transmits a signal to the servomotor. Receives 
and compares position and rate of movement feedback signals from the servomotor.
Servomotor
Converts processed signal into movement of the aircraft flight controls proportional to rate 
and direction of signal. Uses hydraulic, electrical or pneumatic power.
Aerodynamic Feedback
The attitude reached by the aircraft is sensed by the rate gyro which gives a measure of the 
output.
A disturbance to the selected flight path produces an error signal; the autopilot operates to 
move the aircraft back towards its stabilized condition. This causes the error signal from the 
transducer to be progressively reduced and therefore removes the control surface deflection 
after the disturbance has been corrected.
Inner Loop Systems
Inner loop systems are those that provide the auto-stability only. It is the innermost control 
loop.
Outer Loop Systems
Outer loop systems are those extra facilities offered e.g. Altitude Hold, Heading Hold, LNAV, 
VNAV. They are still essentially loops that act from an external position on the inner loop 
and make the inner loop manoeuvre the aircraft into the position required by the outer loop 
control.

Types of Autopilot
An aircraft can be subjected to disturbances about its three control axes i.e. longitudinal (roll), 
lateral (pitch) and vertical or normal (yaw). Stabilization must therefore be controlled about 
the same three axes. Autopilot systems are broken down into three basic control channels:
•	 Roll		
to control the Ailerons 
•	 Pitch	
to control the Elevators
•	 Yaw		
to control the Rudder
It is therefore possible to get an autopilot that is classed as single axis, twin axis or triple axis. 
There will be a separate inner loop for each axis of autopilot control. If an aircraft has more 
than one autopilot there will be one inner loop for each axis of control for each autopilot.
A Single Axis System
A single axis attitude control system would normally be limited to the roll axis only, i.e. a single 
autopilot channel controlling the ailerons. At its most basic, the single axis system will only 
give lateral stability or level the wings. The roll axis is known as the primary axis. This system is 
sometimes simply called a Wing Leveller.
A Two Axis System
A two axis control system would control the aircraft attitude in the roll and pitch axes. The 
pitch axis is known as the secondary axis. There are two autopilot channels that control the 
ailerons and the elevators.
A Three Axis System
A three axis system would give attitude control in all three axes, roll, pitch and yaw. The yaw 
axis is the third or tertiary axis.  
The roll and pitch channels are used as the primary control channels.  It is these two channels 
to which outer loop signals are fed to control the various modes.  
The rudder channel is basically a stability channel.
It is common to have interaction between the roll channel and rudder channel to assist in co-
ordinated turns and to give faster stability response.  
Three axis control is required for autoland.

EU-OPS Requirements
Single pilot operation under IFR or at night.
An operator shall not conduct single pilot IFR operations unless the aeroplane is equipped with 
an autopilot with at least ALTITUDE HOLD and HEADING MODE. This means that the aircraft 
must have at least a two-axis autopilot.
Installation of automatic pilot system
Each automatic pilot system must be approved and must be designed so that the autopilot 
can be quickly and positively disengaged to prevent it from interfering with the control of the 
aeroplane.
Unless there is automatic synchronizing, each system must have a means to readily indicate to 
the pilot the alignment of the actuating device in relation to the control system it operates.
Each manually operated control for the system must be readily accessible to the pilots.
Quick release (emergency) controls must be on both control wheels, on the side of each wheel 
opposite the throttles.
Attitude controls must operate in the plane and sense of motion specified for cockpit controls. 
The direction of motion must be plainly indicated on, or adjacent to, each control.
The system must be designed and adjusted so that it cannot produce hazardous loads on the 
aeroplane, or create hazardous deviations in the flight path, either during normal operation or 
in the event of a malfunction.
If the autopilot integrates signals from auxiliary controls or furnishes signals for operation of 
other equipment, there must be positive interlocks and sequencing of engagement to prevent 
improper operation. Protection against adverse interaction of integrated components is also 
required.
Means must be provided to indicate to the pilots the current mode of operation and any 
modes armed by the pilot.
Types of Actuator
Actuators produce the physical movement of the control surfaces and can be of different types 
depending on their principle of operation which can be:
•	 Electromechanical
•	 Electrohydraulic
•	 Pneumatic
--- Page 364 ---

                 Autopilot

There are two types of configuration in which actuators are connected to the flying controls:
Parallel
The actuator produces the movement of the control surface as well as providing feedback to 
the control stick i.e. the stick will move when the autopilot is controlling the control surfaces.
Figure 26.5 A/P Actuator in parallel
Series
The actuator produces movement of the control surface but not the control stick.
Figure 26.6 A/P Actuator in series
It is also possible to have a combined series/parallel configuration.
Torque Limiter
In flight, particularly where high rates of control are to be produced, the movement of the flight 
control surfaces can result in loads which may impose excessive stresses on the aircraft structure. 
It is necessary therefore, under automatically-controlled flight conditions, to safeguard against 
such stresses, and furthermore to safeguard against a servomotor ‘runaway’ condition which 
would cause control surfaces to be displaced to their maximum hard-over positions.

Autopilot
Such safeguards are implemented by limiting the torque applied to the servomotors, and also 
by allowing them either to slip, or to be completely disengaged, in the event that present torque 
limits are exceeded. The methods adopted usually depend on either mechanical, electrical or 
electromechanical principles.
Engagement Criteria
Autopilot Interlocks
Before coupling an autopilot with the aircraft’s control system the integrity of the Autopilot 
Inner Loop must be established to ensure that it may safely take control of the aircraft.To 
monitor the performance of the inner loop components a system of interlocks is provided which 
close to allow autopilot engagement and hold it engaged if the correct valid signals have been 
received. The function of the interlocks can be represented by a number of relays in series (see 
Figure 26.7), although in modern aircraft the actual switching is more likely to be accomplished 
by solid state logic switching. Failure of a circuit monitored by a relay will cause the autopilot to 
disengage accompanied by the associated aural and visual warning indications. Operation of 
the disengage switch will have the same effect.

Conditions of Engagement
Before the autopilot can be engaged, certain conditions must be met. These conditions vary 
with aircraft type. For the 737-400 these conditions are as follows.
Each autopilot can be engaged by pressing a separate CMD or CWS engage switch. A/P 
engagement in CMD or CWS is inhibited unless both of the following pilot-controlled conditions 
are met:
•	 No force is being applied to the control wheel.
•	 The Stabilizer Trim Autopilot Cut-out Switch is at NORMAL.
Once the above conditions are satisfied and no failures exist, either A/P can be engaged in 
CMD or CWS by pressing the respective engage switch. Control pressure applied after an A/P 
is engaged in CMD overrides the A/P into CWS pitch and/or roll. The light remains illuminated 
in the CMD engage switch.
--- Page 366 ---
Autopilot

                 Autopilot
26
The A/P automatically disengages when any of the following occur:
•	 Pressing either A/P disengage switch.
•	 Pressing either TOGA switch with a single A/P engaged in CWS or CMD below 2000 ft RA.
•	 Pressing either TOGA switch after touchdown with both A/Ps engaged in CMD.
•	 Pressing a lighted A/P engage switch.
•	 Pushing the A/P disengage bar down.
•	 Activating either pilot’s control wheel trim switch.
•	 Moving the Stabilizer Trim Autopilot Cut-out Switch to CUT-OUT.
•	 Loss of respective hydraulic system pressure.
•	 Repositioning the EFI transfer switch.
•	 Either left or right IRS system failure or FAULT light illuminated.
•	 Loss of electrical power or a sensor input which prevents proper operation of the engaged 
A/P and mode.
Only one A/P can be engaged at a given time unless the approach (APP) mode is engaged. 
Pressing an engage switch for the second A/P, while not in the APP mode, engages the second 
autopilot as selected and disengages the first A/P. The second A/P then operates in CWS or 
CMD without interrupting CWS or command operation.
If an A/P is engaged with the CMD engage switch during FD only operation while pitch or roll 
commands are more than ½ scale from centred, the A/P automatically engages in CWS for 
pitch and/or roll and the FD command bars retract.
Automatic Synchronization
In addition to the pre-engage requirements that the autopilot circuits are electrically complete, 
it must also be ensured that on engagement the ‘take-over’ is effected smoothly and without 
‘snatching’ of the aircraft’s control system. In other words the aircraft must be trimmed for 
the desired flight attitude before engagement and the automatic control system must be 
synchronized to maintain that attitude on engagement.
In the majority of autopilot systems synchronization is effected by specifically designed 
synchronizing circuits which automatically sense any existing ‘standing signals’ in the pitch and 
roll channels and automatically reduce or ‘wash out’ these signals to zero. This stops the servo 
actuator in a position which is synchronized with the datum attitude detected by the sensing 
element, such position being indicated by the return of the trim indicator pointer to its central 
position.

Trim
Manual Systems
The purpose of the trim system is to relieve the pilot of forces on the aircraft controls while 
maintaining aircraft attitude. In manual control, trim on light aircraft is provided in all three 
axes through mechanical linkages to trim tabs on the control surfaces. On larger aircraft this 
is usually achieved by electrical actuators that bias the Powered Flying Control Unit (PFCU), 
particularly for pitch trim. Trim steering signals would be provided to the trim tab actuators for 
elevator, aileron and rudder as well as to the horizontal stabilizer.
Manual operation of the pitch trim will, in most systems, automatically disconnect the autopilot 
as it cannot co-ordinate manual trim movement with movement of the C of G or aerodynamic 
movements.
Automatic Trim (Auto-trim)
As the aircraft uses fuel, or changes speed, thrust or configuration, the pitch attitude will 
change. If we are flying the aircraft manually we would trim these forces out manually to 
eliminate stick forces. Currently as our basic autopilot stands if it is flying the aircraft and the 
pitch requirement changes it will simply hold the stick forces using the brute strength of its 
servomotor outputs. This will not pose much of a problem unless the forces overwhelm the 
servomotor or until such time as we wish to disconnect the autopilot. Not only does this mean 
that the aircraft is producing more drag than necessary but if there is a standing load on the 
controls when we disconnect the autopilot we will not know of its existence or which way the 
aircraft will pitch. The aircraft will “snatch” or lurch in response to the out of trim condition. 
This is not a very satisfactory situation so a system of Automatic Pitch Trim was included in most 
autopilot systems.
When the autopilot is engaged automatic trim is available only in pitch. This is called Automatic 
Pitch Trim or simply Auto-trim. Auto-trim is active only when the autopilot is engaged. Fly-
by-wire arrangements will be explained later. It is typically achieved by a separate trim servo 
actuator operating either the normal trim tab or, more commonly on modern jet transports, the 
variable incidence horizontal stabilizer. The latter permits the elevator to always be in neutral 
position with respect to the horizontal stabilizer, therefore allowing the autopilot full elevator 
control authority both sides of the trimmed position. Another important consideration is that 
in the event of autopilot disconnect the aircraft will be in a trimmed condition and thus will not 
suddenly pitch up or down.
The out of trim condition is sensed most commonly by using one of two methods:
•	 A standing load being sensed on an electrical actuator. Due to the out of trim situation the 
autopilot is having to hold a force against the out of trim condition in exactly the same way 
as a pilot would have to. The magnitude of the load on the actuator is going to be directly 
proportional to the force being held, and of course the direction is known from which way 
the actuator is having to apply that load. That information can be used to move the normal 
trimming system of the elevators to reduce the standing load to zero. The aircraft is now in 
trim.
--- Page 368 ---
Autopilot

                 Autopilot
26
•	 The actual position of the actuator. If there is an out of trim force to be coped with the 
actuator will be positioned to input the required control displacement to hold that force. 
The displacement of the actuator will again give the direction and magnitude of the force. 
Large modern aircraft tend to use Trim Tails or all moving tail-planes. Both of these systems, 
due to the way they trim, reset the control inputs to give full elevator movement up and 
down from the trimmed position. So now, as the auto-trim moves the normal elevator trim, 
the displacement of the normal control input is reset, removing the actuator displacement.
Figure 26.8 Trimming by variable incidence tailplane
The output is applied to the trim tab actuator or the horizontal stabilizer.
In the event of a failure of the trim system the pilots would be alerted by warning lights and/
or suitable indications on the electronic display unit. At the same time the autopilot would 
disengage, giving both visual and aural alerts. The latter can also sound when there is an 
excessive trim input as, for example, in an actuator runaway situation. If the auto trim system 
is not available, then the autopilot may become inoperative (will become inoperative for the 
B737-400). If another autopilot is available, it would be common practice to use the fully 
operative system.
If there is only one autopilot or the aircraft is not fitted with auto-trim, the aircraft must be 
correctly in trim before the engagement of the autopilot to minimize the control loading 
expected on disengagement. The standard operating procedure for the aircraft will stipulate 
a time period after which the autopilot must be disengaged, the aircraft re-trimmed and then 
the autopilot re-engaged. This will minimize the control snatch on autopilot disengagement.
The pilots may have some indication of the trim controls but in the case of auto-trim there is 
always a stabilizer trim indicator and an auto-trim failure warning so that the system can be 
monitored during autopilot operation. The autopilot may not engage if there is too great a 
standing load, i.e out of trim condition, already present.

Independent Systems
Mach trim (if required) will operate independently of the autopilot. A Mach trim system is 
provided in aeroplanes that fly at high subsonic speeds and are susceptible to Mach tuck. At 
these speeds as the aeroplane approaches its critical Mach No. the centre of pressure moves aft 
resulting in a nose-down attitude known as Mach tuck. This condition is automatically trimmed 
out by a Mach trim system. The Mach trim system will be armed at all stages of flight but will 
only activate at high subsonic speeds.
Yaw dampers will be covered in detail in another chapter. They are, however, another example 
of an inner loop system.
Fly-by-Wire
Fly-by-wire aeroplanes function differently to conventional aeroplanes in that the pilot or 
autopilot input is via a flight control computer. The computer translates this input into an 
aircraft attitude using all three axes, which it will then maintain until another input is made. 
Even if configuration, thrust or speed changes are made, which would affect the pitch attitude 
of the aeroplane, the flight control computer will maintain the aircraft attitude selected. 
Any load being maintained by the flight control computer will be trimmed on a regular basis so 
the aeroplane is always in trim.  For example in pitch, the flight control computer will deflect 
the elevators, using an electric servomotor to reach the correct aircraft attitude as selected by 
the pilot or autopilot. After a short period of time this would be trimmed using the horizontal 
stabilizer allowing the elevator to return to its neutral position ready for any future use. 
There are mechanical trim backups in pitch and yaw which will override the automatic flight 
control computer trim. The pitch trim is operated by moving the pitch trim wheel which will 
cause the horizontal stabilizer to move, the autopilot to disconnect and override the flight 
control computers pitch attitude.
Outer Loop Control (also Known as Flight Path Modes)
In addition to performing the primary function of stabilization, an Automatic Flight Control 
System (AFCS) can also be developed to control the path of the aircraft horizontally or vertically 
to predetermined conditions. For example to hold a selected airspeed, altitude, magnetic 
heading or intercept and track radio beams from ground-based aids, etc. The number of inputs 
available serve as an indication of the progressive development of automatic flight from the 
basic single-axis wing-levelling type of autopilot, to the highly sophisticated flight guidance 
systems now used in many present-day transport aircraft.
The outer loop inputs are applied to the inner loop in such a way as to fool the auto-stability 
control into believing that the aircraft is being disturbed. The inner-loop systems reaction to

the input is calculated to produce the result required, such as altitude holding or turning to 
follow a heading.
Such data inputs constitute Outer Loop Control and can be referred to as Command Modes 
or Flight Path (Referenced) Modes. Outer loop command modes are coupled to the relevant 
autopilot channel by selection on the Mode Control Panel (MCP) which is located on the 
glare-shield and provides the pilot’s interface with the auto-flight system. A typical example 
of modern twin jet MCP is shown in Figure 26.12. It allows the pilot to engage an autopilot 
and select any of the pitch and roll outer loop inputs. Incorporated in the selector switches are 
lights to indicate which autopilot or command modes are selected.
Only one command mode may be engaged in a single channel at any one time (i.e. one in roll 
and one in pitch). For example it is impossible for the autopilot to hold speed and maintain 
altitude at the same time by pitching the aeroplane. If the aeroplane had an autothrottle the 
autopilot could hold altitude while the autothrottle maintained speed.
The provision of raw data inputs relevant to a particular flight path is referred to as ‘coupling’ 
or as a ‘mode of operation’. Other terms commonly used in connection with operating modes 
are ‘hold’ and ‘capture’. For example, an aircraft flying automatically at a selected altitude is 
said to be in the ‘altitude hold’ mode. The term ‘capture’ relates principally to modes associated 
with the selection and interception of beams from ground-based radio navigation aids; for 
example, ‘glide slope capture’.
In some cases, mode switching is automatic; thus, to switch from intercepting a beam or a 
heading, to tracking the beam on reaching it, a Beam Sensor is installed. This device senses 
beam deviation and switches modes automatically when the aircraft flies into the beam. Glide 
slope capture can also take place automatically, in this case the pitch control channel is switched 
from ‘altitude hold’ mode to glide slope track when the aircraft flies into the glide slope beam.
The raw data is supplied from aircraft sensors (attitude, air data, heading, radio etc.) to the 
relevant auto-flight computer which compares the data with the selected values on the MCP 
and computes control inputs to achieve those selected values.
In a modern transport aircraft which is using a flight guidance system with an automatic 
landing capability, the outer loop inputs could comprise some or all of the modes listed in the 
following table.

Mode Annunciator
The Mode Annunciator will indicate the current auto-flight system status and can be a separate 
indicator or an integrated part of the EFIS primary flight display (Figure 26.10). The electronic 
display indicates armed and engaged modes of the auto-flight system in different colours. It 
can also indicate autopilot, autothrottle, autoland and flight director status.
Figure 26.10 Primary Flight Display
  
There will also be illuminated switches or simply warning lights that will indicate whether an 
autopilot is engaged, warning of disengagement, warning of autothrottle disengagement, 
failure to achieve target speed and of auto-trim failure.

Aircraft Sensor Inputs to the Autoflight Computer
Manometric (or Air) Data
Raw data inputs which come under this heading are those associated with altitude, airspeed/
Mach No. and vertical speed. Each of these provides current aircraft status for outer loop 
control in the pitch channel of the autopilot.
Sensing may be carried out either by independent sensor units, or by a Central Air Data 
Computer (CADC). The sensors operate on the same fundamental principles as the basic pitot-
static instruments, the measuring elements being coupled to appropriate types of electrical 
transducers instead of instruments.
Attitude Reference
Attitude reference data (roll, pitch, yaw) is fed into the auto-flight computer from the primary 
attitude sensors which could be a Vertical Gyro and Directional Gyro combination, an Inertial 
Navigation System or an Inertial Reference System depending on the age of the aircraft. These 
sensors may also transmit data to the ADI and HSI.
Magnetic Heading Reference
A Magnetic Heading Reference System (MHRS or gyro-magnetic compass) combines inertial 
heading with magnetic compass heading providing magnetic heading signals to the HSI and 
reference data to the auto-flight computer.

Radio Navigation
To allow the auto-flight system to be able to capture and track a radio beam data signals are 
transmitted to the relevant auto-flight computer from the VOR and ILS receivers.
Computer Generated Data
Modern aircraft can follow a computer generated flight profile in both roll (lateral) and pitch 
(vertical) from a Flight Management System (FMS). Steering signals from the Flight Management 
Computer (FMC) are connected to the auto-flight computer to control the attitude of the 
aircraft.

Figure 26.12 Inputs to the MCP
An Example of an AFDS (737-400)
For these notes the Boeing 737-400 is used as an example. It is also officially the AFDS that the 
JAR objectives and exams are currently based around. Therefore a description of the AFDS as 
fitted to this aircraft is given.
General
The Automatic Flight System (AFS) for the 737-400 consists of the Autopilot Flight Director 
System (AFDS) and the Auto throttle (A/T). The Flight Management Computer (FMC) provides 
N1 limits and target N1 for the A/T and command airspeeds for the A/T and AFDS.
The AFDS and A/T are operated from the AFDS Mode Control Panel (MCP) and the FMC from 
the Control and Display Unit (CDU).
The AFDS MCP provides co-ordinated control of the autopilot (A/P), Flight Director (FD), A/T 
and altitude alert functions.
AFS mode status is displayed on the Flight Mode Annunciators (FMA) on each pilot’s PFD.
Normally, the AFDS and A/T are used to maintain airspeed and thrust settings calculated by 
the FMC.

Autopilot Flight Director System (AFDS)
The AFDS is a dual system consisting of 2 individual Flight Control Computers (FCCs) and a 
single MCP.
The 2 FCCs are identified as A and B. For A/P operation, they send control commands to their 
respective pitch and roll hydraulic servos, which operate the flight controls through 2 separate 
hydraulic systems.
For FD operation, each FCC positions the FD command bars on the respective PFD.
MCP Mode Selector Switches
The mode selector switches are pressed to select desired command modes for the AFDS and 
A/T. The switch illuminates to indicate mode selection and that the mode can be deselected by 
pressing the switch again. While a mode is active, de-selection can be automatically inhibited 
and this is indicated by the switch light being extinguished.
When engagement of a mode would conflict with current AFS operation, pressing the mode 
selector switch has no effect. All AFDS modes can be disengaged by selecting another command 
mode or by disengaging the A/P and turning the FDs off.

MCP Parameter Selection
The following information is in addition to that contained in the controls and indicators section 
of this chapter.
Parameter selections common to both FCCs for speed, heading, altitude and vertical speed are 
made from the MCP.
Two course selectors and course displays are located on the MCP. The Captain’s course selector 
provides selected course information to the A FCC, the No. 1 VHF Nav receiver and to the 
Captain’s HSI course pointer and course deviation bar. The First Officer’s course selector 
provides selected course information to the B FCC, the No. 2 VHF Nav receiver and to the First 
Officer’s HSI course pointer and deviation bar.
Examples of Outer Loop Inputs in Roll
Heading Select and Hold
The heading select mode sends roll commands to turn and maintain the heading shown in the 
MCP heading display. After mode engagement, roll commands are given to turn in the same 
direction as the rotation of the heading selector only. The bank angle limit is established by the 
Bank Angle Limit Selector on the MCP. Pressing the Heading Select Switch on the MCP engages 
the heading select mode. HDG SEL is annunciated for the AFDS.

Autopilot
The HDG SEL mode automatically disengages upon capture of the selected radio course in the 
VOR LOC and APP modes.
VOR Localizer Tracking (VOR LOC) Mode
The VOR mode gives roll commands to capture and track the selected VOR course. The LOC 
mode gives roll commands to capture and track the selected localizer along the inbound front 
course bearing. Back-course tracking is not available.
Pressing the VOR LOC switch selects the VOR mode if a VOR frequency is tuned, or selects 
a LOC mode if a localizer frequency is tuned. The VOR LOC switch illuminates and VOR LOC 
armed is annunciated.
The selected course can be intercepted while engaged in L NAV, HDG SEL or CWS ROLL, with 
an autopilot engaged in CMD. The capture point is variable and depends on intercept angle 
and closure rate. Localizer capture occurs not later than ½ dot deviation. When within the 
course capture area, the VOR LOC annunciation changes from armed to captured and roll 
commands track the VOR or localizer course.
Tracking Through VOR “Cone of Confusion”
The ‘cone of confusion’ is an area overhead a VOR navigation beacon where the signals 
are unusable. Thus an aircraft transiting the VOR will receive no usable signals for a period 
depending upon its ground speed and altitude.
As the aircraft approaches the VOR the radials are converging and the course deviation indicator 
becomes more sensitive. At some point, before it enters the cone of confusion, the information 
from the selected inbound radial becomes unusable due to the convergence. At this point the 
VOR signals are ‘cut off’ by the ‘over station sensing’ circuits i.e. the roll channel automatically 
de-couples from the radio beam and controls the aircraft through the cone of confusion on 
the drift-corrected heading existing when the radio signals are de-coupled. In other words the 
autopilot goes into Heading Hold for a set period after which it reverts to the VOR Mode. Note 
that the autopilot does not go into Heading Mode.
Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Inertial Referencing System (IRS)
Older aircraft without a Flight Management System may be able to couple the Inertial 
Navigation/Reference System to the autopilot to allow the aircraft to be steered sequentially 
through a series of waypoints that have been loaded into the INS/IRS before flight.
Lateral Navigation (L NAV)
In the L NAV mode, the FMC controls AFDS roll to intercept and track the active FMC route. 
The desired route is activated and modified through the FMC CDUs. In addition to en route 
guidance, the active routes can include terminal procedures such as SIDs, STARs and instrument 
approaches.
Engagement criteria must be met to use L NAV. There must be an active route in the FMC, 
capture criteria must be satisfied and the L NAV switch must be pressed.
L NAV capture criteria is divided into 2 categories. First, any aeroplane satisfies capture criteria 
when within 3 NM of the active route segment. Second, outside of 3 NM, the aeroplane must 
be on an intercept course of 90 degrees or less and intercept the active route segment before 
the active waypoint.
--- Page 376 ---
Autopilot

                 Autopilot

L NAV will automatically disconnect for several reasons. It will disconnect upon reaching the 
end of the active route or upon entering a route discontinuity. Additionally, it will disconnect 
upon either intercepting or missing the intercept of an approach path inbound track. Finally, 
either loss of capture criteria or selecting HDG SEL will disconnect L NAV.
Examples of Outer Loop Inputs in Pitch
Altitude Hold (ALT HLD)
The altitude hold mode gives pitch commands to hold the MCP selected altitude or the 
uncorrected barometric altitude at which the ALT HOLD switch was pressed. ALT HOLD engages 
in either of 2 conditions;
ALT HOLD at the MCP selected altitude. This is indicated by the annunciation of ALT HOLD 
and the ALT HOLD switch light extinguished.
ALT HOLD not at the MCP selected altitude.	This is indicated by the annunciation of ALT 
HOLD and the ALT HOLD switch light illuminated.
ALT HOLD not at the MCP selected altitude occurs with either of the following:
•	 Pushing the ALT HOLD switch while not at the MCP selected altitude.
•	 Selecting a new MCP altitude while in ALT HOLD at the currently selected altitude.
ALT HOLD is inhibited after glide slope capture. When in ALT HOLD at the selected altitude, LVL 
CHG, V/S and V NAV climb and descend functions are inhibited until a new altitude is selected.
The altitude selected on the MCP is referenced to the Captain’s barometric altimeter setting for 
the “A” autopilot and FDS, and to the First Officer’s barometric setting for the “B” autopilot 
and FDS. After ALT HOLD engages, changes in the altimeter barometric settings do not change 
the selected altitude reference.
Altitude Acquire (ALT ACQ)
The altitude acquire mode is the transition manoeuvre entered automatically from a V/S, LVL 
CHG, or V NAV climb or descent to a MCP selected altitude. The altitude acquire mode is also 
armed while climbing or descending in CWS with an autopilot engaged.
Altitude acquire engagement is annunciated ALT ACQ in pitch when levelling off in either V/S 
or LVL CHG. However, V NAV remains annunciated throughout the altitude acquire mode 
when levelling in V NAV.
ALT ACQ engagement is inhibited when the ALT HOLD switch is pressed or while the glide slope 
is captured.
IAS/MACH Hold (SPD)
This will hold a selected IAS or Mach No. by comparing the selected value with the actual value 
from the ADC and pitching the aircraft up or down to decrease or increase speed.
Vertical Speed (V/S)
The V/S mode gives pitch commands to hold the selected vertical speed and engages the auto-
throttle in the SPEED mode to hold the selected airspeed. The V/S mode has both an armed 
and engaged state.

Autopilot
Pressing the V/S switch engages the V/S mode unless the ALT HOLD is engaged or after glide 
slope capture.
V/S engaged is annunciated, the Vertical Speed Display changes from blank to present vertical 
speed and desired vertical speeds can be selected with the vertical speed thumb-wheel.
The V/S mode becomes armed if, while in the ALT HOLD at the selected altitude, a new MCP 
altitude is selected which is more than 100 ft different than the previously selected altitude. 
V/S armed is annunciated and the V/S mode can be engaged by moving the vertical speed 
thumb-wheel.
The V/S mode automatically engages when the altitude acquire mode is engaged and a new 
altitude is selected which is more than 100 ft different than the previously selected altitude. 
The V/S mode annunciates engaged and existing vertical speed appears in the vertical speed 
display. The commanded V/S can be changed with the vertical speed thumb-wheel. Vertical 
speeds can be selected which command flight toward or away from the selected altitude.
Level Change Mode (LVL CHG)
The LVL CHG mode co-ordinates pitch and thrust commands to make automatic climbs and 
descents to preselected altitude at selected airspeeds. A LVL CHG climb or descent is initiated 
by selecting a new altitude and engaging the LVL CHG mode.
During a LVL CHG climb, the annunciations are MCP SPD for pitch and N1 for the autothrottle 
(A/T). During a LVL CHG descent, the annunciations are MCP SPD for pitch and RETARD for 
the A/T while reducing the thrust toward idle. When at idle thrust, ARM is annunciated for the 
A/T.
If a speed mode was active prior to engaging LVL CHG, the previous speed is retained as the 
target speed for the LVL CHG mode. If the LVL CHG mode is engaged with no active speed 
mode, the IAS/Mach display and airspeed cursors synchronize to existing speed and present 
speed becomes the LVL CHG target speed. After LVL CHG mode engagement, the target speed 
can be changed with the MCP speed selector.
Vertical Navigation Mode (V NAV)
With the V NAV mode engaged, the FMC commands AFDS pitch and A/T modes to fly the 
vertical profile selected on the FMC CDUs. The profile includes preselected climbs, cruise 
altitudes, speeds, descents and can also include altitude constraints at specified waypoints. 
The profile may end with an ILS approach to the destination airfield.
Pressing the V NAV switch selects the V NAV mode provided FMC performance initialization 
is complete. The mode selector switch illuminates, the MCP IAS/Mach display becomes blank 
and the airspeed cursors are positioned at the FMC commanded airspeed. The FMA displays 
are V NAV SPD or V NAV PTH for the AFDS pitch mode and FMC SPD, N1, RETARD or ARM for 
the A/T mode.
V NAV climbs and descents are constrained by the selected MCP altitude. V NAV commanded 
speeds can be changed with the FMC CDUs.
During V NAV path cruise flight, selecting a lower MCP altitude arms the FMC to automatically 
begin the descent upon arrival at the FMC calculated top of descent point.

During a V NAV path descent, V NAV remains engaged until:
Glide slope capture, or
Another pitch mode is selected, or
Flaps are extended beyond 15°, or
L NAV is disengaged without glide slope capture.
Proper MCP altitude selections ensure correct altitude alerting.

Other Autopilot Features
Roll and Pitch Modes
Approach mode (APP) allows localizer and glide slope elements of the ILS system to be coupled 
to the roll and pitch channels of the autopilot to allow automatic control down to decision 
height, or to effect a fully automatic landing.
Control Wheel Steering (CWS)
A Control Wheel Steering mode (CWS) is provided in some automatic flight control systems 
(Boeing 737-400), its purpose being to enable the pilot to manoeuvre his aircraft in pitch and/
or roll, through the automatic control system without disconnecting the autopilot. The signals 
for the A/P are produced by transducers in the control column.
Pressing a CWS engage switch, engages the A/P pitch and roll axes in the CWS mode and 
displays CWS P and CWS R on the FMAs.

Autopilot
             
               
          
Autopilot
With CWS engaged, the A/P manoeuvres the aeroplane in response to control pressures 
applied by either pilot. The control pressure is similar to that required for manual flight. When 
control pressure is released, the A/P holds existing attitude.
If aileron pressure is released with 6 degrees or less angle of bank, the A/P rolls the wings level 
and holds the existing heading. This heading hold feature with bank less than 6 degrees, is 
inhibited when any of the following conditions exist:
•	 Below 1500 ft RA with the landing gear down.
•	 After FD VOR capture with TAS 250 kt or less.
•	 After FD LOC capture in the APP mode.
Pitch CWS with a CMD Engage switch selected
The pitch axis engages in CWS while the roll axis is in CMD when:
A command pitch mode has not been selected or was de-selected. 
A/P pitch has been manually overridden with control column force. The force required for 
override is greater than normal CWS control column force. This manual pitch override is 
inhibited in the APP mode with both A/Ps engaged.
CWS P is annunciated on the Flight Mode Annunciators (FMA) while this mode is engaged. 
Command pitch modes can then be selected.
When approaching a selected altitude in CWS P with a CMD engage switch selected, CWS P 
changes to ALT ACQ and when at the selected altitude, ALT HOLD engages.
If pitch is manually overridden while in ALT HOLD, the annunciator changes to CWS P. If control 
force is released within 250 ft of the selected altitude, CWS P changes to ALT ACQ and the A/P 
returns to the selected altitude and ALT HOLD engages. If the elevator force is held until more 
than 250 ft from the selected altitude, pitch remains in CWS P.
Roll CWS with a CMD engage switch selected
The roll axis engages in CWS while the pitch axis is in CMD when:
A command roll mode has not been selected or was de-selected.
A/P roll has been manually overridden with control wheel force. The force required for override 
is greater than the normal CWS control wheel force.
CWS R is annunciated on the FMA while this mode is engaged.
CWS R with a CMD engage switch illuminated can be used to capture a selected radio course 
while VOR/LOC or APP mode is armed. Upon intercepting the radial or localizer, the FD and 
A/P annunciation changes from CWS R to VOL/LOC engaged and the A/P tracks the selected 
course.
Touch Control Steering (TCS)
Touch Control Steering (TCS) also permits a pilot to manoeuvre his aircraft in pitch or roll, but 
unlike CWS the appropriate automatic control channels and servomotors are disengaged while 
the TCS button is held depressed while the pilot flies the aircraft to the desired attitude using
--- Page 380 ---

                 Autopilot
26
manual control. The autopilot is re-engaged by release of the TCS button and the autopilot 
continues to again hold the aircraft in the attitude in which it was left.
Autopilot Limitations and Operational Restrictions
Autopilot Disengage Warnings
The “A/P” light flashes red and a tone sounds when an autopilot has disengaged.
The warning can be reset by pressing either disengage light or either A/P disengage switch.
The A/P warning light stays at steady red if:
Stabilizer is out of trim below 800 ft RA on a dual channel approach.
Altitude Acquire mode is inhibited during an A/P go-around. (Stabilizer not trimmed for single 
A/P operation. See A/P Go-around).
Disengage light test switch is held in position 2 (red filament test).
Automatic ground system test fail.
The light will illuminate a steady amber when the disengage light test switch is held in position 
1 (amber filament test).
The light will flash amber if A/P automatically reverts to CWS pitch or roll while in CMD. The 
light will reset when either light is pressed or another mode is engaged.
Maximum Pitch and Bank Angles
During normal autopilot operation the maximum angles are:
Pitch	
± 10°
Roll	
± 30°
These limits are, however, not stipulated legally and will vary from aircraft to aircraft.
Gain Adaption
Variations in flight parameters such as altitude, speed, aircraft load, configuration and rate 
of manoeuvre, will have an effect on the handling characteristics of an aircraft. It is therefore 
necessary to incorporate ‘gearing’ elements within flight control systems which will adapt 
the parameters to the aircraft so that their effect on handling characteristics is reduced. In 
automatic systems the response is altered by changing the ‘gain’ of the system to a given level 
of input signal. This can be likened to changing gear ratios in a mechanical system.
Gain adaptation is particularly important for maintaining handling characteristics with changes 
in IAS during the different phases of flight and is similar to the gain scheduling in the flight 
director system.
Approach/Land Mode
During an autoland sequence the autopilot has to execute many important manoeuvres. These 
are described in the Autoland notes.

Autopilot
Flight Management System
The autopilot can form part of the overall Flight Management System (FMS). This is may also 
be designated the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) or the Flight Management and 
Guidance System (FMGS). It provides manual or automatic modes of control throughout the 
entire flight envelope from take-off to landing and roll-out. All the subsystems of the FMS are 
fully integrated and have levels of redundancy to achieve a high level of reliability. Redundancy 
is accomplished by providing two or more systems of each type so a failure of one system will 
not affect the operation of the complete system.
The AFCS and FMS will be checked completely during the preflight checks. During these checks 
all the automated systems will be engaged, tested and their various safety devices tested. The 
FMS will be checked for the correct information and any additional information will be entered.

Autoland
Introduction
The approach and landing manoeuvre is the most difficult one demanded of a pilot in that 
it entails control of the aircraft in all three axes simultaneously as well as control of airspeed 
through engine power changes. The pilot has to:
•	 Align the aircraft with the runway centreline
•	 Achieve a sink rate of about 2 feet per second before touchdown
•	 Reduce the airspeed from 1.3VS to about 1.15VS by progressive reduction of engine power
•	 Level the wings before actual landing yaw the aircraft to remove any drift angle (drift “kick 
off” or de-crabbing).
An automatic landing system that takes over from a pilot must be able provide guidance and 
control better than that required of the pilot.
Autopilots have for a long time now been able to fly most of the approach allowing the pilot to 
concentrate on navigating the approach correctly. The pilot would then take over at decision 
height and continue to land manually.  Aircraft that are fitted with all the equipment required 
for a fully automatic landing may, due to lack of required ground equipment or simply for pilot 
experience requirements, only be allowed to carry out an auto-approach. Essentially all the 
procedures are carried out as for an autoland, but when decision height is reached the pilot 
will take over manually.
Autoland System
Objective
In order to achieve the objective of automatic landing, the operation of an automatic flight 
control system must be of such a nature that it will:
Not disturb the flight path as a result of an active malfunction
Have adequate authority for sufficiently accurate control along the required flight path
Warn of a passive failure
Allow the intended flight manoeuvre to be completed following an active or a passive failure.
Requirements
To enable an aeroplane to complete an automatic landing the autoland system requires:
A minimum of two independent autopilots capable of following ILS signals
Two independent radio altimeters to give accurate height from the ground information
Category 3 ILS ground installation at the airport.
Autoland Status
The number of autopilots required also depends upon the autoland status of the aircraft. These 
fall into two main categories:
--- Page 386 ---

                        Autoland

Fail-passive (Fail-soft)
This is defined as the ability of the system to withstand a failure without endangering passenger 
safety, and without producing excessive deviations in the flight path but removing its capability 
to complete an automatic landing.
The minimum number of autopilots required for a fail-passive capability is two.
Fail-operational (Fail-active)
This status is defined as the ability of a system to withstand a failure without affecting the 
overall functioning of the system and without causing degradation of performance beyond 
the limits required for automatic landing.
The system requires a minimum of three autopilots. However, it is possible for an aircraft to have 
a fail-operational category with only two autopilots provided that there is suitable duplicate 
monitoring for each channel.
The Automatic Landing Sequence
Profile
During cruise and initial stages of approach to land, the control system operates as a single 
channel system, controlling the aircraft about its pitch and roll axes, and providing the 
appropriate flight director commands. The profile of an automatic approach, flare and landing 
sequence is shown in Figure 27.1 and is based on a system that utilizes triple digital flight 
control computer channels, allowing for redundancy to operate in the fail-operational and fail-
passive conditions already defined.
Status Annunciator
Depending upon the number of channels that are armed and engaged, the system performs 
what are termed a ‘LAND 2’ status or ‘LAND 3’ status autoland. Thus ‘LAND 2’ signifies there 
is dual redundancy of engaged flight control computers, sensors and servos (fail-passive 
operation) while ‘LAND 3’ signifies triple redundancy of power sources, engaged flight control 
computers, sensors and servos (fail-operational). Each status is displayed on an autoland status 
annunciator.
Approach
Since multi-channel operation is required for an automatic landing, at a certain stage of the 
approach, the remaining two channels are armed by pressing an ‘APPR’ switch on the flight 
control panel. The operation of this switch also arms the localizer and glide slope modes. Both 
of the ‘off-line’ channels are continually supplied with the relevant outer loop control signals 
and operate on a comparative basis the whole time.
Radio Altimeter
Altitude information essential for vertical guidance to touchdown is always provided by signals 
from a radio altimeter which becomes effective as soon as the aircraft’s altitude is within the 
altimeter’s operating range (typically 2500 feet).
AFS Radio Altimeter Loss
Two independent radio altimeters provide RA to the respective FCC. The Captain’s radio 
altimeter also provides RA information to the A/T.

Autoland
With a radio altimeter inoperative, do not use the associated FCC or the A/T, if affected, for 
approach and landing, i.e. failure of a single radio altimeter causes the autoland system to fail 
passive.
The Sequence
An example of an autoland sequence (for a Boeing aircraft) is described below.
Approach (APP) mode
The approach mode arms the AFDS to capture and track the localizer and glide slope. It can be 
engaged for dual or single autopilot operation (autoland with dual only). Dual autopilot (A/P) 
approach operation is described first.
Approach mode allows both A/Ps to be engaged at the same time. Dual A/P operation provides 
fail-passive control through landing flare and touchdown or an automatic go-around. During 
fail-passive operation, the flight controls respond to the A/P commanding the least control 
movement.
One VHF Nav receiver must be tuned to an ILS frequency before the approach mode can be 
selected. For a dual A/P approach, the second VHF NAV receiver must be tuned to the ILS 
frequency and the corresponding A/P engaged prior to 800 ft RA.
Localizer and Glide Slope Armed
After setting the localizer frequency and course, pressing the APP switch selects the APP 
mode. The APP switch illuminates and VOR LOC and G/S armed is annunciated. The APP mode 
permits selecting the engagement of the second A/P. This arms the second A/P for automatic 
engagement after LOC and G/S capture and when descent below 1500 ft RA occurs.
The localizer can be intercepted in the HDG SEL, CWS R or L Nav modes. Either the LOC or G/S 
can be captured first (although it is most common to capture LOC then G/S).
Localizer Capture
The localizer capture point is variable and depends on the intercept angle and rate of closure, 
but does not occur at less than ½ a dot deviation. Upon LOC capture, VOR LOC annunciates 
captured, 1 CH is annunciated for the A/P status, the previous roll mode disengages and the 
aeroplane turns to track the LOC.
Glide Slope Capture
The G/S can be captured from above or below (although from below is generally preferred). 
Capture occurs at 2/5 dot deviation. G/S annunciates captured, the previous pitch mode 
disengages, the APP switch light extinguishes if the localizer has also been captured, aeroplane 
pitch tracks the G/S and the annunciated N1 thrust limit for the A/T is GA.
After LOC and G/S are both captured the APP mode can be exited only by pressing the TOGA 
switch or by disengaging the A/P and turning off both FD switches or re-tuning a VHF Nav 
receiver.
After Localizer and Glide Slope Capture
The A/Ps will disengage and the FD command bars will retract to indicate an invalid ILS signal.

At 1500 feet Radio Altitude (RA)
Shortly after capturing both LOC and G/S and descending below 1500 ft RA, the second A/P 
couples with the flight controls, FLARE mode armed is annunciated and the A/P go-around 
mode arms but is not annunciated. ROLL OUT mode if available will also now arm. The autoland 
status will also now be annunciated as either “LAND 2” (or “LAND 3” for fail-operational 
aircraft).
The pitch and roll axes cannot be manually overridden into CWS. Attempts to do so will result 
in A/P disengagement.
800 ft RA
The second A/P must have been engaged by 800 ft RA to execute a dual A/P approach. 
Otherwise, engagement of the second A/P is inhibited on descending through 800 ft RA.
400 - 330 feet RA
The stabilizer is automatically trimmed an additional amount nose-up, with the elevators 
neutralizing and holding the pitching up moment. If the A/Ps subsequently disengage, forward 
control column force may be required to hold the desired pitch attitude. This biasing aids the 
flare and in the event of a subsequent fail-passive the aircraft will tend to pitch nose-up to 
prevent a hard contact with the ground and aids the initiation of a go-around.
If FLARE is not armed by approximately 350 ft RA, both A/Ps automatically disengage.
At 45 feet Gear Altitude (GA)/ 50 ft RA
The A/P flare manoeuvre starts at approximately 50 ft RA and is completed at touchdown. 
FLARE engaged is annunciated and the FD command bars retract. Also:
The stabilizer trim is again automatically trimmed an additional amount nose-up.
The FLARE mode is automatically engaged (replacing G/S) to reduce the vertical speed from 
around 10 - 12 feet per second at 50 feet to 1 - 2 ft/sec at the point of touchdown. 
It uses the rate of reduction of radio height as the controlling signal.
The A/T begins retarding thrust at approximately 27 ft RA so as to reach idle at touchdown.
The gear altitude calculation, which is pre-programmed into the computer, is based upon radio 
altitude, pitch attitude, and the known distance between the landing gear, the fuselage and 
the radio altimeter antenna.
At about 5 feet GA:
The flare mode is disengaged and there is transition to the touchdown
LOC disengages
Roll-out mode (if available) will engage.
At about 1 foot GA:
The pitch attitude of the aircraft is decreased to 2°
At touchdown, a command signal is supplied to the elevators to lower the aircraft’s nose and 
so bring the nose landing gear wheels in contact with the runway and hold them there during 
the roll-out.

Autoland
When reverse thrust is applied the autothrottle system is automatically disengaged.
Irrespective of reverse thrust deployment, the A/T automatically disengages approximately 2 
seconds after touchdown.
The automatic flight control system remains on until manually disengaged by the flight crew, 
which is when the autoland sequence is considered to be completed.
Other Features of Autoland
Runway Alignment
Although the yaw channel has not been mentioned any auto-flight system capable of an 
autoland must be capable of ‘kicking off drift’ prior to touchdown. This is known as runway 
alignment mode and will typically be armed at the same time as the flare mode and engaged 
at less than 100’. During the approach from 1500’ the yaw channel will compute the difference 
between heading and track, and when align mode engages the rudder deflects to align 
the aircraft with the runway centre line before touchdown. This manoeuvre is known as de-
crabbing, or drift ‘kick-off’.
Roll-out
Another function of Cat 3 autoland systems is roll-out which gives steering commands on the 
ground proportional to localizer deviation along the centre line. These commands can show 
left/right steering guidance through a rotating ‘barbers pole’ indicator known as a para-visual 
display (PVD). Alternatively automatic steering can be achieved by applying deviation signals to 
the rudder channel and nosewheel steering to keep the aircraft on the centre line throughout 
the ground roll.
A/P Go-around Mode
The A/P go-around (GA) mode requires dual A/P operation and becomes armed when FLARE 
armed is annunciated. The A/P GA mode cannot be engaged before flare arm is annunciated 
or after the A/P senses touchdown.
Note: if the GA mode is selected after touchdown and prior to A/T disengagement, the 
A/Ps will disengage and the A/Ts may command GA thrust, with the procedure being flown 
manually.
Pressing either TOGA switch engages the GA mode and GA engaged is annunciated for the 
AFDS. The MCP IAS/Mach display becomes blank and the airspeed cursors are positioned at 
the AFDS commanded speed. Command airspeed is the flap manoeuvring speed.
A/P GA Pitch Control
Upon GA engagement, the thrust levers advance toward the reduced GA N1. The A/P initially 
commands a 15 degree nose-up pitch attitude, and the airspeed cursors display manoeuvring 
speed for the flap setting. When a programmed rate of climb is established, the A/P controls 
pitch to hold airspeed based on the normal flap manoeuvring speed.
A/P GA Roll Control
With the GA mode engaged, the A/Ps maintain the aeroplane ground track existing at GA 
engagement.

Leaving A/P GA mode
Below 400 ft RA, the A/Ps must be disengaged to change either pitch or roll modes from GA. 
Above 400 ft RA, other pitch and roll modes can be selected.
If the roll mode is changed first, the selected mode engages in single A/P roll operation and is 
controlled by the A/P which was first engaged. Pitch control remains in the dual A/P GA mode.
The pitch mode cannot be changed from GA until sufficient nose-down trim has been input to 
allow single A/P operation. This nose-down trim is automatically added to reset the previous 
trim inputs that were applied during the auto-approach. If the pitch mode is the first to be 
changed from GA, the selected pitch mode engages in single A/P operation and is controlled 
by the first A/P that was engaged for the approach. The second A/P disengages and the roll 
mode changes to CWS R.
With pitch engaged in GA, ALT ACQ engages when approaching the selected altitude and ALT 
HOLD engages at the selected altitude if the stabilizer position is satisfactory for single A/P 
operation.
The transition from GA to ALT ACQ is normally successful if the selected altitude is at least
1000 ft above the GA engagement altitude. A higher selected altitude may be required if full 
GA thrust is used.
If stabilizer trim is not satisfactory for single A/P operation, ALT ACQ is inhibited and the A/P 
disengage lights illuminate steady red and pitch remains in GA. To extinguish the A/P disengage 
lights, a higher altitude can be selected or the A/Ps disengaged.
Approach (APP) Mode / Single A/P
A single A/P ILS approach can be executed by engaging only one A/P after pressing the APP 
switch. Single A/P approach operation is the same as for dual, with the following exceptions:
A/P status of 1 CH is annunciated for the entire approach after localizer capture.
Full automatic flare and touchdown capability is not available. FLARE is not annunciated and 
stabilizer trim bias is not applied.
An A/P GA is not available.
The diagram on the next page shows an automatic landing. See if you can correctly fill in 
the pitch and roll armed and engaged modes in the annunciator boxes at each stage of the 
approach and landing. I’ve started you off at point A as Approach mode has been selected.

ILS
An Instrument Landing System (ILS) is a short-range navigational aid which provides azimuth 
and vertical guidance during the approach to an airport runway. The system comprises ground-
based transmitting elements and also receiving elements carried on board the aircraft.
The ground-based elements are:
•	 A localizer transmitter which sends runway azimuth approach information.
•	 A glide slope transmitter which provides vertical approach information.
•	 Marker beacons which transmit information about the distance to the runway threshold. 
Marker beacons have been replaced with Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) in most 
installations.
The airborne elements are:
•	 A localizer signal receiving antenna (usually the same antenna as the one used for the VOR).
•	 A glide slope signal receiving antenna.
•	 A dual ILS receiver installation.
•	 An indicator which shows whether the aircraft is on the correct approach path. Loc and GS 
deviation.
•	 A marker beacon antenna and receiver (or DME).
•	 Marker lights on the main instrument panel.

Weather Minima
In low visibility operations, the weather limits for landing are given in the following terms:
Runway Visual Range (RVR), which is an instrumentally derived value that represents the 
range at which high-intensity lights can be seen in the direction of landing along the runway. 
The measurements are transmitted to the air traffic controller who can inform the pilot of the 
very latest visibility conditions.
Decision Height (DH) This is the wheel height above the runway elevation at which a go-
around must be initiated by the pilot, unless adequate visual reference has been established, 
and the position and approach path of the aircraft have been visually assessed as satisfactory 
to safely continue the approach or landing.
Minimum values of DH and RVR are known as ‘weather minima’ and are specified by the 
national licensing authorities for various types of aircraft and airports. When the traffic 
controller advises that the RVR is above the specified minimum, the pilot may descend to the 
specified decision height and if, by then, he has sighted a sufficiently large segment of the 
ground to enable him to be confident of his judgement, he may carry on and land. He must 
otherwise overshoot, and either enter the holding pattern pending another approach, or 
divert to an alternative airport. During the approach, the pilot’s line of sight is down the glide 
path and not along the runway, and this gives rise to another factor, called ‘slant visual range’, 
which a pilot must take into account in order to avoid misinterpretation of visual cues.
The ICAO Categorization of Low Visibility Landing Capabilities
All Weather Operations
The term ‘all weather operations’ is frequently used in connection with automatic landing 
systems and in describing low weather minima . This is a term which can, and sometimes is, 
taken to mean that there are no weather conditions that can prevent an aircraft from taking 
off and landing successfully. This is not the case, because no automatic system can, for example, 
perform the landing task in wind conditions in excess of those for which the aircraft has been 
certified, this being primarily governed by the controllability characteristics and strength factors 
of the aircraft. Similarly, no automatic system can land an aircraft on a runway which has a 
surface which is not fit for such an operation because of contamination by water, slush or ice.
Category of Operation
The definitions of the main categories are illustrated in Figure 27.2, overleaf.
The three categories also serve as an indication of the stages through which automatic 
approach and automatic landing development progress, and thereby designate the capabilities 
of individual automatic flight control systems. In addition, they designate the standards of 
efficiency of the ground guidance equipment available at airports, namely ILS localizer and 
glide path, and approach, runway and taxiway lighting.
Category 1
A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height no lower than 60 m 
(200 ft), and with either a visibility not less than 800 m, or a runway visual range not less than 
550 m

Category 2
A precision instrument approach and landing with decision height lower than 200 ft but not 
lower than 100 ft, and a runway visual range not less than 300 m.
Figure 27.2  Categories of low visibility landing capabilities
Category 3A
A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height lower than 100 ft and a 
runway visual range not less than 200 m.
Category 3B
A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height, if any, lower than 50 ft 
and a runway visual range less than 200 m but not less than 75 m.
Category 3C
To and along the surface of the runway and taxiways without external visual reference.
Alert Height
The alert height is a specified radio height, based on the characteristics of the aircraft and its 
fail-operational landing system. In operational use, if a failure occurred above the alert height 
in one of the required redundant operational systems in the aircraft the approach would be 
discontinued and a go-around executed, unless reversion to a higher decision height is possible. 
If a failure in one of the required redundant operational systems occurred below the alert 
height, it would be ignored and the approach continued to complete the autoland.

Autothrottle
Introduction
An autothrottle system is a computer controlled, electromechanical system which can control 
the thrust of an aircraft’s engines within specific design parameters. The throttle position of 
each engine is controlled to maintain a specific value of thrust in terms of:
•	 Fan Speed (N1)
•	 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) or
•	 Target Airspeed (set by SPD on mode control panel)
Thrust is the force generated by the engines. The throttles control the thrust and in some 
aircraft the preferred name for the throttles is thrust levers. It is worth noting that although 
there are thrust computation systems there is, as yet, no direct indicator of thrust value in use. 
Instead N1 and EPR are used to indicate a measure of engine thrust.
Using the above modes the autothrottle can control either engine thrust or aircraft speed from 
the beginning of the take-off roll until the system is disconnected after an automatic landing.
Autothrottle System
System Components
The autothrottle can also be called the Thrust Management System (TMS) that works in 
conjunction with the autopilot and the FMS.
Figure 28.1 shows a basic autothrottle system and signal interfacing between various aircraft 
systems and sensors.
Inputs
These would include:
•	 Mode selection and A/T Arm switch on the MCP
•	 TAS, Mach No. and TAT from the ADC
•	 Attitude and acceleration from the IRS
•	 N1 speed and/or EPR from engine sensors

Outputs
The main outputs from the system would be signals to:
•	 A/T servo actuator to move the throttles
•	 A/T disengage circuit
•	 BITE (built-in test equipment) circuits in the FCC and the FMC
•	 Mode annunciation to the EFIS symbol generator
•	 Thrust limits and to the EICAS / ECAM display
•	 Failure warnings annunciations (lamp and/or aural, electronic display)
Feedback
The autothrottle system compares the actual values with reference values and passes control 
signals to the servomotors of the thrust levers. In order to control the speed at which the thrust 
levers are moved, there is a suitable feedback from the servo actuators to the TMC.
Boeing 737-400 General
The A/T system provides automatic thrust control from the start of the take-off through climb, 
cruise, descent, approach and go-around or landing. In normal operation, the FMC provides 
the A/T system with N1 limit values.
The A/T moves the thrust levers with a separate servomotor on each thrust lever. Manually 
positioning the thrust levers does not cause A/T disengagement unless 10 degrees of thrust 
lever separation is exceeded during a dual channel approach after FLARE armed is annunciated. 
Following manual positioning, the A/T may reposition the thrust levers to comply with 
computed thrust requirements except while in the HOLD and ARM modes.

Power Management Control (PMC)
The thrust control system consists of a hydromechanical Main Engine Control (MEC) unit and a 
PMC unit mounted on each engine. The MEC schedules fuel to provide the thrust called for by 
the Thrust Lever setting on the flight deck. This fuel flow is further refined electronically by the 
Power Management Control (PMC) without moving the thrust levers.
The PMC uses MEC power lever angle, N1 speed, inlet temperature and pressure to adjust, or 
trim, the MEC to obtain the desired N1 speed. The PMC adjusts fuel flow as a function of thrust 
lever angle.
The PMC provides a constant thrust climb feature once the thrust lever is set at the beginning 
of climb. Thus, when thrust is set for climb, the PMC automatically maintains that thrust 
throughout the climb profile with no further thrust lever adjustments. If the thrust lever is 
repositioned, the PMC maintains the setting corresponding to the new thrust lever angle.
The PMC includes failure detection and annunciation modules which detect PMC failures 
and provide a signal to the crew. For detectable failure conditions, the PMC schedules a slow 
N1 drift over approximately 30 seconds and then illuminates the PMC INOP light, the ENG 
system annunciator light and the MASTER CAUTION lights. For a PMC failure, the PMC can be 
selected OFF by a switch on the aft overhead panel. The engine speed is then controlled by 
the hydromechanical MEC only. The PMC INOP light is suppressed below starter cut-out engine 
speed.
A/T - PMC Operation
The A/T system operates properly with the PMCs ON or OFF. In either case, the A/T computer 
controls the FMC N1 limits.
During A/T operation, it is recommended that both PMCs be ON or both OFF, as this produces 
minimum thrust lever separation. A/T take-offs may be performed with both PMCs OFF.
A/T Engagement and A/T Disengagement
Moving the A/T Arm switch to ARM, arms the A/T for engagement in the N1, MCP SPD or FMC 
SPD mode. The A/T Arm switch is magnetically held at ARM and releases to OFF when the A/T 
becomes disengaged.
Any of the following conditions or actions disengages the A/T:
Moving the A/T Arm switch to OFF.
Pressing either A/T Disengage switch.
An A/T system fault is detected.
2 seconds have elapsed since landing touchdown.
Thrust levers become separated by more than 10 degrees during a dual channel approach after 
FLARE is annunciated.
A/T disengagement is followed by A/T Arm switch releasing to OFF and the A/T Disengage 
light flashing red.

The A/T Disengage lights can be extinguished by any of the following actions:
•	 Returning the A/T Arm switch to ARM
•	 Pressing either A/T Disengage light
•	 Pressing either A/T Disengage switch
The A/T Disengage lights do not illuminate when the A/T automatically disengage after landing.
Take-off Mode
The take-off mode is engaged by pressing either TOGA switch with the aeroplane on the 
ground, the A/T armed and the desired take-off N1 thrust limit selected from an FMC CDU. 
The A/T annunciation changes from ARM to N1 and the thrust levers advance toward take-off 
thrust.
The A/T sets take-off thrust. THR HLD annunciates at 84 kt (64 kt for aeroplanes with earlier 
model A/T computers) to indicate that the A/T cannot change thrust level position, but thrust 
levers can be repositioned manually.
After lift-off, the A/T remains in the THR HLD until 400 ft RA is reached and approximately 
18 seconds have elapsed since liftoff. A/T annunciation then changes from THR HLD to ARM. 
Reduction to climb thrust can now be made by pressing the N1 switch.
Until 2½ minutes after lift-off, automatic reduction to climb thrust is inhibited when in LVL 
CHG or V/S mode. If V NAV, ALT ACQ or ALT HOLD is engaged during this 2½ minute period, 
automatic thrust reduction occurs normally.
N1 Mode
The A/T maintains thrust at the N1 limit selected from an FMC CDU. N1 is annunciated for the 
A/T and the N1 switch illuminates. Pressing the N1 switch changes the A/T mode from N1 to 
ARM.
If an engine fails while the A/T is in the N1 mode, the thrust lever of the failed engine will 
advance forward a few degrees and then return to or below the other thrust lever position.
Speed Mode
The speed mode is available throughout the flight once the take-off phase is completed. 
Pressing the MCP Speed Select switch selects the speed mode if compatible with the engaged 
AFDS pitch mode. MCP SPD is annunciated for the A/T mode and the Speed Mode switch 
illuminates. The speed or Mach shown in the MCP IAS/MACH display is the target speed. The 
A/T will not set power above the displayed N1 limit; however, the A/T can exceed an N1 value 
that has been manually set by the N1 manual set knob. If an engine fails while the A/T is in a 
speed mode, both thrust levers advance together to maintain the target speed.
When on final approach in landing configuration, it is not recommended to set the A/T 
command speed to allow for wind or gust corrections. Through airspeed and acceleration 
sensing, the A/T corrects for normal wind gusts. Higher command speed settings result in 
excessive approach speeds. The recommended A/T approach speed setting is VREF +5.
Below 400 ft RA, A/T thrust level response rate and engine power levels are sufficient to place 
the engines in the rapid acceleration range.

FMC Speed Mode
The FMC SPD mode is an A/T mode which is commanded by the FMC during V NAV operation. 
When engaged, the MCP IAS/Mach display is blank, the airspeed cursors are positioned at the 
FMC commanded airspeed and the A/T maintains this commanded speed. The A/T is limited 
to the N1 value shown on the thrust mode annunciators.
N1 Equalization
The A/T attempts to equalize N1 through the dual servo individual thrust lever control. 
Equalization control is limited to 8 degrees of thrust lever separation.
ARM Mode
The A/T annunciates ARM when the A/T Arm switch is at ARM and no A/T mode is engaged. 
The thrust levers can be manually positioned without interference from the A/T system while 
ARM is annunciated.
The A/T automatically transfers to ARM from the SPEED or N1 mode when the mode is 
deselected by pressing the respective mode selector switch while the switch light is illuminated.
Descent Retard Mode
The A/T engages and annunciates RETARD during LVL CHG and V NAV descents. RETARD 
changes to ARM when the thrust levers reach the aft stop or when they are manually prevented 
from reaching the aft stop.
Landing Flare Retard Mode
During landing, the RETARD mode engages, reduces thrust and annunciates RETARD 2½ 
seconds after FLARE mode engagement or at 27 ft RA, whichever occurs first. During a non- 
precision or visual approach with flaps extended to 15 or greater and the AFDS not in ALT ACQ 
or ALT HOLD, the A/T RETARD mode engages at 27 ft RA. The A/T automatically disengages 
approximately 2 seconds after landing touchdown.
Go-around Mode
With the A/T Arm switch at ARM, the A/T go-around mode is armed when descending below 
2000 ft RA, with or without the AFDS engaged. Once armed, the A/T go-around mode can be 
engaged until 2 seconds have elapsed after landing touchdown.
Pressing either TO/GA switch engages the A/T go-around mode. GA is annunciated for the A/T 
and the thrust levers advance to the reduced go-around thrust setting. This setting produces a 
1000 to 2000 fpm rate of climb. After reaching reduced go-around thrust, pressing either TO/
GA switch the second time signals the A/T to advance thrust to the full go-around N1 limit.
After reaching reduced or full go-around thrust, the A/T GA mode can be terminated by 
selecting another AFDS pitch mode or when ALT ACQ annunciates engaged.
During a single engine FD go-around, the A/T will increase thrust to the full N1 limit.
Autothrottle Disengage Switches
Pressing an Autothrottle Disengage switch disengages the autothrottle (A/T). The A/T 
Disengage light flashes and the A/T ARM switch on the MCP trips off. Pressing the Autothrottle 
Disengage switch a second time extinguishes the A/T warning.
After an automatic A/T disengagement, pressing the Autothrottle Disengage switch will 
extinguish the A/T warning.

Autothrottle Disengage Light
The A/T Disengage light will flash red if the A/T disengages for any reason.
The A/T Disengage light will illuminate steady red when the Disengage Light Test Switch is 
held in position 2 (red filament test position) and steady amber when the Disengage Light Test 
Switch is held in position 1 (amber filament test position).
The A/T Disengage light flashing amber indicates an A/T airspeed error if speed is not held 
within +10 or -5 knots of the commanded speed when all of the following conditions exist:
•	 In flight
•	 Flaps not up
•	 A/T engaged in MCP SPD, or FMC SPD mode
An automatic test of the A/T flashing amber function is performed if the A/T is engaged and 
the following conditions exist:
•	 MCP SPD or FMC SPD is the active A/T mode
•	 More than 150 seconds after lift-off
•	 Flaps extended
The A/T amber light flashes for 2 seconds, remains extinguished for 2 seconds and then flashes 
for 2 seconds again.
Thrust Mode Annunciator Panel (TMA)
On the Boeing 737-400 the Thrust Mode Annunciator panel is located on the centre instrument 
panel, above the N1 rpm indicators. It displays the active N1 limit reference mode for auto 
throttle and manual thrust control. N1 limits are also displayed on the N1 rpm indicator cursors 
with the reference knobs pushed in.
N1 limits are normally calculated by the FMC. When FMC N1 limit calculations become invalid, 
or if either engine N1 is less than 18%, A/T LIM is annunciated. The autothrottle computer then 
calculates a single N1 limit for the affected engine(s).

Flexible Take-off
In situations where take-off can be executed without the need for full engine power (such as 
light weight take-off from a long runway), then reduced power may be used, thereby reducing 
engine wear and increasing their life. This is called the Flexible Take-off mode (and in the Airbus 
aircraft there is a detent position for the thrust levers labelled FLEX TO). The most basic way to 
achieve the reduced thrust is to manually set a lower rpm setting. To achieve a reduced power 
setting with the autothrottle we can select a temperature on the control panel that is higher 
than the ambient airfield temperature. This causes the thrust computation system to calculate 
a lower limiting EPR or N1, thereby producing reduced power for the take-off.
Turbulence
When operating in light to moderate turbulence the autothrottle can stay engaged unless 
performance is poor.
There will be increased thrust lever activity and airspeed excursions of 10 to 15 knots are to be 
expected. The autothrottle is not to be used in severe  turbulence.
FADEC
The system example comes from the Airbus series of aircraft.
Function
FADEC stands for full authority digital engine control. It provides complete engine management 
throughout all phases of flight and performs the following functions:
•	 Gas generation control (fuel flow, acceleration/deceleration, variable bleed valve and 
variable stator vane schedules, turbine clearance control, idle setting)
•	 Engine limit protection (over-speed N1 and N2)
•	 Power management (control of engine thrust rating, computation of thrust parameter 
limits, auto-thrust system demand, thrust lever position manual demand)
•	 Automatic engine starting sequence (control of start valve, fuel, ignition, monitoring N1, 
N2, FF, EGT)
•	 Manual engine starting sequence (passive monitoring of start valve, fuel, ignition, N1, N2, 
FF, EGT)
In performing its functions it takes into account such variables as power demanded, air bleed 
for air conditioning and de-icing, temperature, static pressure and engine accessory selection.
Advantages
The FADEC system reduces crew workload, provides engine limit protection, improves engine 
life and saves fuel and maintenance down time.
Components
FADEC consists of an electronic engine control (EEC) plus a fuel metering unit, sensors and 
peripheral units. There are suitable interface circuits between the EEC and its peripheral units. 
There are 2 FADEC channels per engine, one in control and one in standby for redundancy.
--- Page 404 ---
Autothrottle
28
398
               Autothrottle
28
Each channel is powered by the aircraft’s A/C supply before and during the initial start and 
then by an individual internal magnetic alternator above 12% engine rpm.
Thrust control is provided by a FADEC dedicated to each engine. Thrust selection is achieved 
by means of the thrust levers when in manual mode or the Flight Management and Guidance 
System (FMGS) when in automatic mode. Thrust rating limit is provided by the FADEC according 
to the thrust lever position both for manual and automatic thrust.
Fuel Control
In addition to the high pressure fuel pumps and shut-off system there are again 2 main systems 
controlling engine performance. The Hydromechanical Unit (HMU) is modulated by the FADEC. 
It provides control of fuel flow to the combustion chamber, control of fuel hydraulic signals to 
actuators, and over-speed protection.
The Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) transforms FADEC orders through a torque motor / servo valve 
into fuel flow to the engine nozzle. The FMV resolver provides an electrical feedback signal 
proportional to the FMV position. The bypass valve regulates a constant pressure drop across 
the FMV to ensure that metered fuel flow is proportional to FMV position.
The FADEC computes fuel flow necessary to hold the target N1. To obtain this N1, the N2 is 
allowed to vary without exceeding N2 min and N2 max. The FADEC will also vary N2/N1 in 
order to maintain RPM under varying load conditions, maintain bleed air production, avoid 
engine stalls or flameout. With the Airbus FADEC it even modulates the cooling airflow around 
the engine in order to expand or contract the casing to control the compressor and turbine 
clearances at nominal settings.
Thrust Levers
The thrust levers are only moved manually (unlike many other autothrottle systems). They 
move over a sector which is divided into 4 segments defined by 5 detents or stops. Thrust lever 
position is transmitted to the FADEC which computes and displays the thrust rating limit and 
the N1 TLA. Note that there is no reverse idle detent. When the idle stop is cleared by pulling 
up the reverse thrust levers, reverse idle is selected.
Thrust Rating Limit
Thrust rating limit is computed according to the thrust lever position. If the thrust lever is set in 
a detent, the FADEC will select the rating limit corresponding to this detent. If the lever is set 
between 2 detents the FADEC will select the rating limit corresponding to the higher mode.
Thrust Control
Manual Mode
The engines are in the manual mode provided that the ATS function is:
•	 Not armed
•	 Armed and not active (thrust lever is not in the ATS operating range and/or no alpha 
floor condition)
In these conditions, each engine is controlled by the position of the corresponding thrust 
lever. Thrust modulation is performed by the pilot moving the thrust lever from IDLE to TO/
GA position. Each position of the thrust lever within these limits correspond to an N1. When 
the thrust lever is positioned in a detent, the corresponding N1 is equal to the N1 rating limit 
computed by the associated FADEC.

When the thrust lever is set in the FLX-MCT detent:
On the ground
When the engine is running, the flex TO thrust rating is selected provided a flex TO temperature 
greater than the current TAT has been selected through the MCDU. Otherwise the MCT thrust 
is selected.
After TO
A change from FLX to MCT is achieved by setting the thrust lever to TO/GA or CL position and 
then back to MCT. After that FLX rating setting is not possible.
MAX TO power is always available by pushing the thrust lever fully forwards.
Automatic Mode
In the auto-thrust mode (A/THR function active), the thrust is computed by the FMGC and is 
limited to the value corresponding to the thrust lever position (except if the alpha floor mode 
is activated).

Yaw Dampers
Dutch Roll
Dutch roll is caused by the interplay between lateral stability around the longitudinal axis (roll) 
and longitudinal stability around the vertical axis (yaw) of an aircraft in flight. An aircraft with 
an excess of lateral stability will by default have poor directional stability and therefore will be 
susceptible to Dutch roll.
More simply, any disturbance of an aircraft in yaw directly causes a secondary disturbance 
in roll and vice versa. Stability is the aircraft’s natural tendency to resist any disturbance and 
return to the same conditions that existed before the disturbance occurred. If lateral stability is 
greater than directional stability then Dutch roll will be the result.
Consider an aircraft disturbed by a gust causing it to yaw. As the aircraft yaws, one wing will 
travel slightly faster through the surrounding air and the other wing will travel slightly slower. 
The fast wing will produce slightly more lift than before and the slower wing will produce 
slightly less. This obviously will produce a roll.
As lift increases then lift induced drag will increase so the faster, higher wing will produce more 
drag and the low wing will produce less. This causes a yawing moment in opposition to the 
initial disturbance and the whole process is reversed.
Swept wing further exacerbate the tendency for Dutch roll because the forward going wing 
undergoes a reduction in effective wing sweep, further increasing the lift it produces, while the 
retreating wing experiences an increase in effective wing sweep, again reducing its lift.
All airline aircraft will be statically stable, in that they will naturally try to return to the 
undisturbed condition. The amount they are dynamically stable depends on the amount of 
damping force available. Aerodynamic damping is dependent on the change in the relative 
airflow, which affects the angle of attack and the TAS. As an aircraft climbs its true airspeed 
must increase to maintain the lift pressure. This increase in TAS means that the relative angle 
of attack for the aerodynamic surfaces is reduced for the same given disturbance, and so the 
corrective force supplied by that surface is reduced, so damping effectiveness is reduced at 
high altitude.
Function of a Yaw Damper
To increase the damping forces at altitude could mean an increase in the overall size of the 
stabilizing surfaces but this would also increase drag. Another option is to produce an aircraft 
that is dynamically stable at lower and middle altitudes and have a system to automatically 
counter Dutch roll. This system detects the yaw then applies rapid, small and effective rudder 
deflections stopping the Dutch roll before it starts. This system we call a Yaw Damper.
The yaw damper will either be the third axis of an autopilot system or will be an addition to the 
third axis of autopilot control.
The yaw damper will be on for the duration of the flight and will provide turn co-ordination, 
runway alignment and assist during asymmetric thrust.
Large, modern, airliners generally have poor Dutch roll characteristics and so tend to have 2 
and even 3 yaw damper systems. This is because the only way to control an aeroplane with 
poor Dutch roll tendencies, and a failed yaw damper system, is to operate at a much lower 
altitude where the TAS is reduced.

Yaw Dampers
The Yaw Damper
Typical Yaw Damping Signal Processing
Sensing
A single axis rate gyro, or in modern aeroplanes an input from the IRS, is used to sense the 
aeroplane’s motion about the normal or vertical axis. The objective being to sense the yawing 
motion as quickly as possible and produce a correcting demand signal to the servo/actuator 
which then feeds signals to the rudder control system to apply rudder in opposition to the yaw.
Phase Advance
Phase advance is a means of applying the damping application as soon as possible. The reason 
for this is that damping must be applied when the rate of disturbance is at its greatest, not 
when the disturbance has moved to the point where the natural stability of the fin has arrested 
the disturbance. If a rudder application is applied at the same instant the fin starts to return 
the aircraft, both the combined forces will over correct and cause the aircraft to overshoot. 
Figure 29.3 tries to explain when the ideal damping is required.
The phase advance accelerates the signal so that the rudder input occurs at the point of 
maximum yaw and cancels the signal quickly so as not to exaggerate the yawing effect.
Dutch Roll Filter
The system as described, however, would also interpret a normally commanded turn as a 
yaw and act in opposition to produce an unco-ordinated turn (in fact the rudder would be 
exacerbating the co-ordination problem by introducing the full amount of its rudder authority 
in the opposite direction to that required). So the yaw damper system needs to be able to 
distinguish commanded turn inputs from yaw due to a disturbance or apparent Dutch roll.
When an aircraft is turned, the aircraft rolls about the longitudinal axis in the direction of the 
turn and also YAWS about the vertical axis. A yaw damper is provided to dampen Dutch roll, 
not to prevent the aircraft following a turn command. Therefore only the Dutch roll frequency 
must be acted upon by the yaw damper.
The Dutch roll frequency is based on the natural yawing frequency of the aircraft. The frequency 
is relatively LOW and will differ slightly with aircraft type. 
Yaw dampers must be designed to allow the Dutch roll frequency to control the rudder but 
block other frequencies. Figure 29.5 illustrates a typical Dutch roll filter and circuit action.
Initially, while the rate of turn is building up to the constant rate, the Dutch roll filter output 
also builds, then falls off to nothing when the rate of turn becomes constant. The reverse, 
with opposite polarity as the filter capacitor discharges, occurs as the aircraft levels out on 
completion of the turn. Therefore, whilst the turn is constant the filter output is zero. This 
results in no rudder demand.
Figure 29.4 shows an aircraft yawing at the Dutch roll frequency. Since the rate of turn is 
constantly changing, the output from the rate gyro is constantly changing. The DC graph at 
the bottom of Figure 29.4 is the Dutch roll filter output.

Figure 29.4 Filter output - Dutch Roll
The DC polarities are the greatest when the rate of turn is the greatest and reverse when the 
direction of turn (rate of gyro signal) reverses.
Figure 29.5 is a super simplified yaw damper, illustrating mainly Dutch roll filter. The Dutch 
roll filter is a NARROW BAND PASS FILTER designed to pass only signals which change the 
frequency of the Dutch roll. The rate gyro produces outputs for all turns, but only those related 
to Dutch roll will appear at the input to the servo amplifier driving the rudder servomotor.

Rudder Control Computing Authority
As removal of oscillations does not require a large rudder movement and to reduce the hazard 
posed by a yaw damper runaway, yaw damper authority is normally only about 3-6 degrees 
left and right of centre. If 2 yaw damper systems are operating on a single span rudder their 
authority is accumulative, i.e. singly each system could move the rudder by 3 degrees, together 
they can move it by 6 degrees.

Yaw Dampers
On aircraft with a split rudder surface, if one yaw damper system fails then the aircraft has only ½ 
the yaw damper protection that it originally had. This is allowed for in the design and operation 
of the aircraft. As even this small input may cause overstress in certain flying conditions, some 
aircraft have an input to the yaw damper computer from the CADC to schedule the gain of the 
yaw damper inputs for the ambient flying conditions. At high speed therefore the yaw damper 
authority may be even further reduced to avoid an overstress condition.
Operating Modes
Synchronization
This is to prevent yaw axis engagement transients by cancelling servomotor outputs by an 
inverting integrator. RL1, see Figure 29.6, is energized prior to yaw damper engagement. 
Any amplifier output is fed back through the integrator, the inversion through the integrator 
cancels any transients present. On engagement of the yaw damper, RL1 is de-energized.
Engaged Mode
Providing the interlock logic is good, the engage solenoid engages allowing the yaw damper 
elements of the Power Control Unit (PCU) to pressurize. The rate gyro signal is phase advanced 
and applied to the demodulator. The demodulator converts the signal to a DC signal where the 
output polarity will represent the AC signal input phase. The yaw damper frequency is passed 
by the bandpass filter which blocks all other frequencies. Consequently, the yaw damper does 
not oppose normal turn manoeuvres and does not respond to aircraft vibration and bending. 
The modulator restores the AC signal maintaining the appropriate phase. The servo amplifies 
the signal and applies it to the transfer valve which in turn drives the yaw damper actuator 
which drives the main actuator. The maximum deflection of the rudder is 3° - 4° in either 
direction.
The Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) position feedback is applied to SP2 to 
cancel the processed rate gyro signal when the corresponding change in rudder position is 
appropriate for the rate of yaw change. Position feedback is also applied through the energized 
relays of RL2 which is fed back to SP2.The purpose of this is to ensure that the rudder will 
always return back to the neutral position. The rudder can be affected by crosswinds. If the 
crosswind is strong, the position feedback voltage may not be large enough to drive the rudder 
to the central position. The position feedback voltage now causes INT 2 to ramp up, increasing 
the voltage at SP2. This increase in position feedback starts to drive the rudder back to the 
neutral position. As the rudder returns the position feedback voltage decreases allowing the 
integrator to run down.
Yaw Damper Testing
Actuation of the yaw damper test switch to either the right or the left applies a voltage to 
the yaw damper rate gyro torquing coil which torques the rate gyro and simulates aircraft 
movement. The rudder position indicator responds to this action of an output from the position 
transducer. If the switch is moved to the left the indication will first move to the left and then 
back to the centre; on release of the switch the indication will move to the right and back to 
the centre. The reverse will happen if the switch is first moved to the right.
Yaw Damper Indications
Yaw damper controls and indications are fairly simple. On a typical aircraft (fitted with 2 yaw 
dampers), the main indications will be a panel or part thereof that contains an on/off switch, a 
test switch or button and a failure light for each of the yaw dampers. The failure light indicates 
many faults in the system: loss of hydraulic or electrical power, logic failure in the yaw damper 
computation system, loss of input from the rate gyro. The switch can then be used to isolate
--- Page 414 ---

the inoperative yaw damper to avoid spurious rudder inputs.
Also involved with the monitoring of the yaw dampers is a small rudder trim indicator, one 
for each yaw damper system fitted. It indicates the demands on the rudder by moving left 
and right of centre. It is mainly used during the testing of the yaw dampers during preflight 
checks. If the yaw damper test switch is operated for one of the yaw dampers, a test signal 
operates a small torquing coil on the yaw damper rate gyro. This moves the gyro and fools the 
yaw damper system into thinking that a yaw condition exists. A pass at test is indicated by the 
position indicator moving in the direction tested and back to centre. Moving the switch to the 
left simulates a yaw in one direction and the position indicator should move to the left also. If 
the switch is operated to the right then the rudder should move to the right.
Some aircraft do not have test switches and rely on the yawing movement of the aircraft 
during taxi to test the yaw damper system. So in a left turn the yaw damper signal will move 
left and the yaw damper will then move the rudder left and the signal will return to the neutral 
position.

Control Laws
Introduction
The autopilot must be able to manouevre the aircraft logically and safely in a similar manner 
to the way a human pilot should. This means ensuring the autopilot does not break aircraft 
limitations in terms of speed, load factor, pitch and bank limits etc. However, the autopilot 
should be able to use a satisfactory amount of the performance of the aircraft otherwise the 
manoeuvres would take too long to execute.
For example consider a light aircraft on a VFR navigational exercise. Overhead the next 
waypoint the pilot requires an 80° left turn to proceed to the next point. The bank angle used 
will be determined by that turn. The pilot will not generally choose under normal circumstances 
to turn with 5° of bank as that would mean the turn taking an inordinate amount of time. 
Conversely the pilot would not normally choose a 90° banked turn as that would be excessively 
hard, possibly breaking load factor limitations as well as probably causing a loss of height. A 
turn using 30° - 45° angle of bank would be the most sensible. If the turn required was about 
10° instead of 80° then banking to 30° would generally be considered to be too harsh.
The autopilot needs to be able to apply similar logic to all its actions. Whenever the autopilot is 
required to make a correction either for stability or when referring to a particular flight path, 
the control response will always be in proportion to deviation or corrective action required but 
only up to a limit that prevents the autopilot attempting a manouevre that would cause an 
excursion from the safe flight envelope.
Boeing 737-400 Autopilot Limiting and Reversion Modes
Command Speed Limiting and Reversion Modes
To prevent the AFS from causing a flight envelope excursion there is a system of command 
speed limiting and reversion modes. AFS command limiting and reversion is independent of 
the stall warning and airspeed/Mach warning systems.
Command Speed Limiting
The AFS provides speed, pitch and thrust commands to avoid exceeding the following limit 
speeds:
•	 VMO / MMO.
•	 Wing flap limiting speeds.
•	 Landing gear speeds.
•	 Minimum speeds
The commanded speed can be equal to, but will not exceed, a limit speed.
Speeds greater than VMO / MMO cannot be selected from the MCP. Speeds can be selected which 
exceed flap and gear limiting speeds or that are less than the minimum flight speed.
Minimum speed is based on an angle of attack and is approximately 1.3VS for the current flap 
configuration. It is sensed by the angle of attack vanes, one on either side of the forward 
fuselage.
If a speed greater than a placard speed or less than the minimum speed is selected, the AFS 
allows acceleration or deceleration to slightly short of the limit, then commands the limit speed. 
The over-speed or under-speed limiting symbol appears in the MCP IAS/Mach display when the 
commanded speed cannot be reached.
--- Page 420 ---
Control Laws
30
414
           Control Laws
30
Either pitch or thrust, whichever is engaged in a speed mode, attempts to hold the limit speed. 
The commanded limit speed and MCP speed condition symbol remain until another speed is 
selected which does not exceed the limit. A speed 15 kt greater than the minimum speed must 
be selected to remove the under-speed symbol.
Reversion Modes
During some flight situations, speed control by the AFDS or A/T alone could be insufficient to 
prevent exceeding a limit speed. If this occurs, AFDS and A/T mode automatically revert to a 
more effective combination. The reversion modes are:
Placard Limit reversion.
Minimum airspeed reversion.
Mode reversion occurs slightly before reaching the limit speed. Both the AFDS and the A/T 
have reversion modes which activate according to the condition causing the reversion.
Placard Limit Reversion
When one of the placard limits (gear, flap or VMO / MMO) is reached, the over-speed limiting 
symbol appears in the MCP IAS/Mach display and the following occurs:
•	 If not in AFDS or A/T speed control and the A/T is armed, the A/T reverts to SPEED mode 
and controls speed to the placard limit.
•	 If in AFDS or A/T speed control, no reversion is necessary. The AFDS or A/T, whichever is 
controlling speed, holds speed slightly below the placard limit.
•	 If the A/T is not available, no reversion response to gear or flap placard speeds is available. 
The AFDS reverts to speed control for VMO / MMO speed limiting.
Minimum Speed Reversion
The AFDS and A/T do not control speed to a speed which is less than the minimum speed for 
the current flap configuration. This speed is approximately 1.3VS. Minimum speed, FMC speed 
or selected speed, whichever is higher, becomes the AFS commanded speed. If actual speed 
becomes equal to or slightly less than the minimum speed, the under-speed limiting symbol 
appears in the MCP IAS/Mach display and if operating in the V/S mode, the AFDS reverts to 
LVL CHG.
The AFS commands a speed 5 kt greater than the minimum speed. Selecting a speed 15 kt 
greater than the minimum speed reactivates normal MCP speed selection control. The AFDS 
commands nose-down pitch to increase airspeed if the thrust levers are not advanced. When 
actual speed becomes 15 kt greater than minimum speed, the under-speed limiting symbol 
disappears.
The A/P disengages and the FD command bars retract when in LVL CHG climb with a command 
speed equal to minimum speed and a minimum rate of climb cannot be maintained without 
decelerating.
No minimum speed reversion is available when the A/T is OFF and the AFDS is in ALT HOLD, 
ALT ACQ or after G/S capture.

Control Laws
Flight Envelope Protection
Introduction
Flight envelope protection is taken to the extreme by fly-by-wire aircraft with the aim of 
ensuring that the aircraft remains within the normal flight envelope in all phases of flight. The 
system prevents the envelope being violated during extreme situations, such as:
•	 Windshear
•	 Very high turbulence
•	 Mid-air collision avoidance
•	 GPWS or TCAS activation
•	 Mismanagement by the crew.
The purpose of the flight envelope protection is to:
•	 Give full authority to the pilot in order to consistently achieve the best possible aircraft 
performance in those extreme conditions.
•	 Reduce the risks of overcontrolling / overstressing the aircraft.
•	 Provide the pilot with an easy, instinctive and immediate procedure to achieve the best 
possible performance when required.
The Protection
The system provides protection in all phases of flight to prevent the aircraft exceeding the 
limits for the following parameters:
•	 Angle of attack
•	 Speed
•	 Pitch attitude
•	 Bank angle
•	 Load factor
High Angle of Attack
The protection enables the pilot to execute a rapid pull-up manoeuvre in an emergency situation 
(as in a mid-air collision avoidance situation) at maximum angle of attack, max, without over-
controlling the aircraft. The technique requires simply that the pilot “snatch stick fully back”. If 
the aircraft exceeds the normal flight envelope for any reason, the pilot is immediately made 
aware of the situation by the pitch auto-trim stop and the aft pressure required on the stick 
to keep the flight path. The high angle of attack protection is an aerodynamic protection but 
thrust is required to maintain the flight path and the auto-thrust function would automatically 
provide TOGA thrust when the aircraft reaches a certain value (called floor ) before it gets to 
max. The input to the circuit is the angle of attack and the output is applied to the elevators 
and the auto-thrust.

           Control Laws

High Speed
High speed protection circuits prevent the aircraft from reaching Vd / Md by adding a positive 
nose-up g demand to the pilot demand on the stick; this demand is proportional to the amount 
of speed overshoot beyond VMO / MMO. This enables a pilot to enter a steep dive rapidly by 
pushing the stick forward, safe in the knowledge that the high speed protection will prevent 
the aircraft from exceeding the design speed limits.
The inputs to the unit would be airspeed/Mach No. from the air data computer and the output 
is applied to the elevators.
Pitch Attitude
The pitch attitude protection, which is only available in fly-by-wire aeroplanes, enhances the 
high angle of attack protection and the high speed protection. The circuit reduces the pitch 
demand of the stick when the aircraft reaches the pre-defined maximum pitch attitude values 
which are:
30° nose-up and 15° nose-down.
The input is the pitch angle from the attitude gyros and the output is applied to the elevators.
Bank Angle
On a commercial aircraft the bank angle does not normally exceed 30°. However, in certain 
circumstances higher bank angles might be required. Bank angle protection, which is only 
available in fly-by-wire aeroplanes, allows the pilot to achieve any roll manoeuvre efficiently 
and prevents the aircraft entering into an uncontrollable state. For example, the limits of bank 
angle for an Airbus aircraft are:
•	 67° in the normal flight envelope
•	 45° when high AoA is triggered
•	 40° when high speed protection is triggered.
After a roll manoeuvre if the pilot releases the stick, the aircraft would return to a bank angle 
of 33°. The bank angle limit is achieved by reducing the roll rate demand progressively as the 
bank angle increases.
Load Factor
A commercial aircraft is designed to withstand a maximum load factor, beyond which structural 
damage is likely to occur. In conventional aircraft where no protection is provided the pilot has 
to assess the instantaneous g load and could overstress the aircraft in an urgent situation.
Load factor protection, available in fly-by-wire aeroplanes, is provided by sensing the g load on 
the aircraft with accelerometers. The g load limiter protects the aircraft against overstress by 
maintaining it within its structural limitations while allowing the pilot to react immediately to an 
evasive manoeuvre. The load factor protection is linked to the high angle of attack protection.

Autopilot Gain Adaption / Gain Scheduling
In the same way as the Flight Director System uses gain scheduling to reduce demands when 
in close proximity with the ground in order to ensure that the FD system does not demand 
a manouevre that would endanger the aircraft, the autopilot has a comparable system. 
This ensures that for example, during an autoland the autopilot’s pitch and roll authority is 
significantly reduced as the aircraft nears the ground. An example of this may be an aircraft 
that has an autopilot which when used in the manual mode may have bank angle limited to 
45°. During VOR or Localizer tracking this may be reduced to 30° as that is deemed all that is 
necessary. However, during the final phase of an automatic approach or an autoland this may 
be reduced to 15°.
Gain adaption may also be used to alter the autopilot’s limits to allow for differing aircraft 
performance at different altitudes and speeds. Although artificial feel is provided to give pilots 
awareness of control forces, autopilots could easily ignore artificial feel inputs and overstress 
the aircraft. So an input from the ADC to the autopilot may be used to reduce the autopilot’s 
authority in proportion to Q.

Flight Warning Systems
Introduction
The purpose of the Flight Warning System (FWS) is to produce cautions and warnings for the 
crew to increase their situation awareness and to give them suitable indications of the action 
necessary to avoid impending danger.
The proliferation of various warning systems in today’s aircraft poses a severe problem in that 
the crew could be confused by the multiplicity of warnings. It is therefore necessary to install 
an integrated flight warning system that will prioritize the warnings. By producing warnings 
relevant to a particular stage of flight and inhibiting other warnings the system enables the 
crew to respond to the warning posing the most immediate threat to safety.
Levels of Alerts
The alerting and warning system produces the following levels of alerts:
•	 Warnings or Level A alerts. These require immediate crew action. Warnings must attract 
the pilot’s attention in sufficient time for appropriate action to be taken.
•	 Cautions or Level B alerts. These require immediate crew alertness and subsequent crew 
action.
•	 Advisories or Level C alerts. These require crew alertness.
Warnings in General
The alerting and warning messages are presented to the crew in visual, aural and sensory 
(tactile) forms.
Visual
The level of alert is indicated by colours as follows:
•	 Warnings are presented in red
•	 Cautions are shown in amber or yellow
•	 Advisories are any colour except red or green. (On EICAS panels they are also amber)
These visual indications can be presented in two different forms:
•	 Electronic Screens. Alerts and warnings appear in coloured text or symbols on various 
electronic screens (flight, navigation, engine and aircraft system displays).
•	 Lights or Flags. Red lights or reflective flags signify warnings and require remedial action if 
flight is to continue. An amber light or flag is used to indicate that a system or equipment 
is approaching a limit of normal function and that corrective action is necessary to prevent 
further deterioration and consequent failure.
Additionally, master warning and caution lights are normally provided and are located near 
the centre of scan in front of each pilot.

Flight Warning Systems
Aural
An audible warning is mandatory if the pilot is required to assume control. This can be in a 
variety of forms depending upon the type of aircraft. The alert can be in the form of sounds 
or synthetic voice messages or a combination of both. For multiple alerts, the warnings are 
prioritized: Stall, Windshear, GPWS, ACAS.
Warnings
Boeing aircraft produce the following aural warnings:
•	 A bell accompanies fire messages
•	 A siren accompanies warnings on cabin altitude, configuration and overspeed
•	 A wailer accompanies autopilot disconnect
•	 Synthetic voice messages for ground proximity, windshear, airborne collision avoidance
Airbus aircraft produce:
•	 continuous repetitive chimes (red warnings)
•	 cavalry charge (autopilot disconnect)
•	 cricket sound (stall warning)
•	 synthetic voice (GPWS, TCAS warnings)
Cautions
Beepers with various tones or chimes or musical chords are used to caution the crew to potential 
threats to safety.
Sensory
A vibratory mode on the controls is used to indicate stall approach and demands immediate 
action to avert loss of control. In some aircraft a stick-pusher provides guidance to prevent a 
further deterioration of the situation that demanded the vibratory warning.
To rationalize warnings systems, a Master Warning Indicator light is often provided near the 
centre of scan. In older systems the crew member would then refer to a Master Centralized 
Warnings Panel (CWP) where warnings were assembled in a rational order and annotated. In 
the modern Electronic Flight Instrumentation Systems (EFIS) most of the alerts and warnings 
appear on appropriate electronic screens together with associated aural messages and master 
warning lights.

The Flight Warning System (FWS)
General
The Flight Warning System generates alerts and warnings for the following situations:
•	 Engine and airframe systems malfunctions
•	 Aerodynamic limits exceeded
•	 Presence of external hazards
Engine and airframe systems malfunctions
These are dealt with in detail in the Engines and the Systems sections of the course.
Aerodynamic limits
If aerodynamic limits are exceeded the FWS provides the following alerts to the crew:
•	 Altitude Alerting
•	 Overspeed Warning
•	 Stall Warning
These are dealt with in the next chapter.
External hazard warning
The external hazards that constitute a threat to aircraft safety are proximity to terrain and to 
other aircraft. These hazards can be avoided by the use of:
The Ground Proximity Warning System and 
The Airborne Collision Avoidance System. These are dealt with in Chapters 34 and 35.

FWS Components
The FWS system comprises:
Inputs
There are inputs from various sources including hundreds of engine and airframe sensors, air 
data sensors, GPWS and ACAS systems.
A processing unit
This is made up of one or two flight warning computers.
Outputs
The outputs are classified either as alerts or as warnings and are generated according to the 
nature of the malfunction or threat to safety. Alerts can be visual (amber lights or text on 
VDUs) or aural (chimes or tones). Warnings are given in the form of red lights or by red text on 
electronic screens (steady or flashing) as well as aural signals (siren, bell, hooter). Additionally 
there are red and amber lights on the glare shield in front of the pilots to act as attention 
getters. A block diagram of a Boeing 767 warning and alert system is shown at Figure 32.2.

Aerodynamic Warnings
Introduction
The Flight Warning System alerts the crew if there are deviations from certain aerodynamic 
parameters like altitude, airspeed and angle of attack. The system therefore provides the 
following alerts and warnings:
•	 Altitude Alerting System
•	 Overspeed Warning
•	 Stall Warning
Altitude Alerting System
Function
The function of the altitude alerting system is to warn the pilots that the aircraft is approaching 
or deviating from the altitude selected on the autopilot control panel. It does this in certain 
height bands above and below the selected altitude.
Operation
The height bands within which altitude alerting operates are typically 300 feet to 900 feet for 
Boeing aircraft and 250 feet to 750 feet for Airbus aircraft. Figure 33.1 shows the operation of 
altitude alerting on a Boeing 747-400.
Figure 33.1 Altitude alert (Boeing 747-400)
Approaching a Selected Altitude
At 900 feet prior to the selected altitude a white box will be displayed around the current 
altitude display on the PFD, together with a momentary audible alert. At 300 feet prior to the 
selected altitude the white box disappears.

Deviation from Selected Altitude
At 300 feet from the selected altitude:
•	 Master caution lights illuminate
•	 Continuous caution beeper sounds
•	 EICAS caution message ALTITUDE ALERT is displayed
•	 Current altitude box changes to amber
The audible alert and master caution light can both be cancelled by pressing the light. The 
warning ceases on return to within 300 feet of the selected altitude, or when the aircraft 
exceeds 900 feet from the selected altitude.
Block Diagram
Figure 33.2 shows a block diagram of a Boeing 767 altitude alerting system. When the aircraft 
approaches the selected altitude the advisory light on each electric altimeter illuminates. If the 
aircraft deviates by more than 300 feet from the selected altitude the system generates a level 
B warning (i.e. a caution) consisting of a level B message on the EICAS display, an alert tone 
from the speakers and illumination of the master caution (amber) light and the ALT ALERT 
light.

Regulatory Requirement
It is a requirement for EASA registered Commercial Air Transport aircraft to be equipped with 
an altitude alerting system if it is:
•	 a turboprop aircraft weighing more than 5700 kg or has more than 9 passenger seats or
•	 a turbojet aircraft
The altitude alerting system must be capable of:
•	 alerting the crew on approaching the preselected altitude
•	 alerting the crew by at least an aural signal when deviating above or below a preselected 
altitude
Overspeed Warning
Function
The purpose of the overspeed warning system is to alert the flight crew if the airspeed exceeds 
the VMO / MMO limits calculated by the air data computer (ADC).
Operation
Whenever an overspeed situation occurs in an aircraft with electronic instrumentation the 
system:
•	 sounds the siren or horn
•	 illuminates the red master WARNING lights
•	 displays the message OVERSPEED on the EICAS upper display in red
The warning continues while the overspeed situation exists and cannot be cancelled by 
depressing the red master WARNING light switch.
The system obtains its input from the air data computers (ADCs) via the flight warning system. 
It can be tested on the ground before flight by pressing a test switch which would then sound 
the siren or horn as appropriate for that aircraft.
In case of system failure the pilot would receive no warning if VMO or MMO is exceeded.
Displays
The maximum allowable speed is shown on the airspeed indicator by means of a barber’s pole 
on a conventional instrument and on the airspeed tape on the primary flight display or EADI 
of an EFIS display. These are shown in Figure 33.3 and Figure 33.4. The barber’s pole indicates 
the VMO up until the MMO becomes limiting The barber’s pole will then move anti-clockwise 
to indicate the maximum allowable speed. As altitude increases when climbing at a constant 
indicated airspeed the MMO when expressed as an indicated airspeed will decrease.

Stall Warning System
Function
The purpose of the stall warning system is to warn the pilot of an impending stall. It does so when 
the aircraft approaches the stalling angle of attack for the current speed and configuration of 
the aircraft.
Stall Warning Systems
The simplest form of system, and one which is adopted in several types of small aircraft, consists 
of a hinged-vane-type sensor mounted in the leading edge of a wing so that the vane protrudes 
into the airstream. In normal level flight conditions, the airstream maintains the vane in line 
with the relative air flow. If the aircraft’s attitude changes such that the angle of attack (AoA)
increases, then, by definition, the airflow will meet the leading edge at an increasing angle, 
and so cause the vane to be deflected. When it reaches the angle at which the warning unit 
has been preset, the vane activates a switch to complete a circuit to an aural warning unit in 
the cockpit.
In larger types of aircraft, stall warning and prevention systems are designed to perform a 
more active function, such as ‘stick-shaker’ or ‘stick-push or nudger’ type.
The Warning
The regulatory margin between the stall and the stall warning is 5 knots or 5% of the CAS 
whichever is the greater.
The warning provided can be in the form of tactile, aural or visual or a combination of these 
signals. Most aircraft have warning provided by stick-shakers which vibrate the control column 
as well as produce a rattling noise. In fly-by-wire systems the warning consists of a cricket (insect) 
sound, a synthetic voice STALL message and the red master WARNING light illumination.
The stall warning must continue until the angle of attack is reduced to approximately that at 
which the stall warning is initiated.
Operation
The stall warning module processes the signals from the various inputs to produce appropriate 
stall warning output signals. The system has the following inputs:
•	 angle of attack
•	 flap and slat positions
•	 landing gear weight-on position
•	 airspeed
The angle of attack sensors are usually located on either side of the front fuselage. Sensing 
relays denote the positions of the flaps and slats. Since the pitch attitude of the aircraft is also 
changed by the extension of flaps or slats the angle of attack signal has to be modified when 
these are extended. During take-off when the nosewheel lifts off, microswitches operate to 
make the stall warning system active. The airspeed is usually derived from the ADC.
The output signals from the system can be applied to:
•	 a stick-shaker motor
•	 an angle of attack indicator aural warning
•	 synthetic voice warning
•	 red master WARNING light

Stall Protection
A stall protection system may be fitted to large commercial aircraft, to prevent them from 
entering the stall. In fly-by-wire systems, the flight computer will not allow the aircraft to 
approach the stall. In other aircraft an output from the AFCS advances the throttles to full 
power if there is a deceleration to below 1.2VS. On aircraft which have a T-tail a stick-pusher 
may be fitted, to push the control column forward in the event that the aircraft slows to 2 kt 
above the stall speed. This will prevent the aircraft entering a deep stall, from which there is 
little or no chance of recovery. 
Components
A block diagram of the component parts of a stall warning system and an angle of attack 
sensor are shown at Figure 33.5.
Figure 33.5 components of a stall warning system
Angle of Attack Sensing
The angle of attack (AoA), or alpha (α) angle, also known as the aerodynamic incidence, is the 
angle between the chord line of the wing of an aircraft and the direction of the relative airflow, 
and is a major factor in determining the magnitude of lift generated by a wing. Lift increases 
as the AoA increases up to some critical value at which it begins to decrease due to separation 
of the slow-moving air (the boundary layer) from the upper surface of the wing, which, in turn, 
results in separation and turbulence of the main airflow. The wing, therefore, assumes a stalled
--- Page 451 ---

445
    Aerodynamic Warnings
33
Aerodynamic Warnings
condition, and since it occurs at a particular angle rather than a particular speed, the critical 
AoA is also referred to as the stalling angle. The angle relates to the design of aerofoil section 
adopted for the wings of any one particular type of aircraft, and so, of course, its value varies 
accordingly; typically it is between 12° and 18° for straight wings but may be as high as 30° or 
40° for swept or delta wings.
Angle of Attack Probes
The two types in current use 
are the conical slotted probe 
and the vane detector; the 
conical slotted probe is shown 
in Figure 33.6 and the vane 
type in Figure 33.7. The vane 
detector is a counter-balanced 
aerodynamic 
vane 
which 
positions the rotor of a 
synchro. 
Both 
types 
are 
protected 
against 
ice 
formation by a heater.
The conical probe extends 
through the aircraft skin 
perpendicular to the flow of 
air. The probe is attached to a 
paddle inside the transmitter 
housing. 
The 
probe 
and 
paddle are free to rotate. Two 
sets of slots in the probe allow 
pressure variations, caused 
by 
changes 
in 
airstream 
direction, to be transmitted 
through separate air passages 
to opposite sides of a paddle 
chamber. When the pressure 
acting on one side of a paddle 
is greater than the pressure 
on the other side, the paddle 
and probe rotate until the 
pressures are equal. The 
probe thus positions itself to 
determine the angle of attack 
of the aircraft. The probes or 
vane detectors are mounted 
on both sides of the fuselage, 
usually forward of the wing 
line, to compensate for side-
slip/yaw. Angle of attack probes send information to the stall warning system, the ADC, and, if 
fitted, Flight Envelope Protection Systems and Angle of Attack Indicators.

Configuration Warning
Some aircraft incorporate configuration warning systems for take-off and landing. Landing 
configuration would give an audible warning if certain throttles are retarded without the 
landing gear locked down. There may also be warnings for flaps. (This would not be required 
on aircraft fitted with GPWS, discussed in the next chapter).
The Take-off Configuration Warning (TOCW), as the name suggests, lets the pilot know, by 
means of an audible warning, that the aircraft is not in the correct configuration for take-off. 
Different aircraft may have different parameters for activation, but typically the TOCW would 
sound if throttles are advanced with:
•	 Flaps not in take-off position
•	 Slats not in take-off position
•	 Stabilizer trim outside take-off range
•	 Spoilers/speedbrakes deployed
•	 Remotely operated flight control locks not disengaged
•	 External doors/hatches not locked closed
•	 Parking brake applied

Ground Proximity Warning System
Introduction
The aim of the system is to give visual and audible warning signals to a pilot when the aircraft’s 
proximity to the terrain poses a potential threat to its safety. Although not a foolproof 
means of preventing a collision with the earth’s surface, GPWS enhances flight safety and 
can prevent those accidents which could result from crew errors or distraction, malfunction or 
misinterpretation of navigational equipment, or inappropriate ATC instructions.
Figure 34.1 shows the three elements of a GPWS: inputs, outputs and a central processing unit. 
The central processing unit will also indicate a computer failure and any failures of the six input 
signals. The system operates between 50’ and 2450’ actual height above the surface and 
automatically selects the correct mode of operation.

MODE 2 - Excessive Terrain Closure Rate
Mode 2 monitors Mach number, radio altitude rate of change, barometric altitude and 
aircraft configuration.
Mode 2 has two boundaries. Penetrating the first boundary causes an aural alert of 
“TERRAIN, TERRAIN”, followed by the repeated aural warning “WHOOP, WHOOP PULL 
UP”. After leaving the PULL UP area, the repeating TERRAIN message will again be heard 
while in the terrain portion of the envelope. If both boundaries are penetrated while in the 
landing configuration, only the repeating TERRAIN aural alert will occur. The terrain message 
is repeated each 1.5 seconds.
As Mach number increases from 0.35 to 0.45 with gear up, the highest radio altitude at 
which Mode 2 alert warning will occur is increased to 2450 feet. This higher portion of the 
envelope is inhibited with the flap override switch in the FLAP OVRD position.

corrected.
Mode 3 is effective between 50 and 700 feet radio altitude and generates the alert when 
the accumulated barometric loss equals approximately 10 percent of the existing barometric 
altitude.
Mode 3 does not arm during the descent until below 200 feet radio altitude.

When this envelope is penetrated at less than Mach 0.35, the aural alert “TOO LOW GEAR” 
is sounded. When the envelope is penetrated at more than Mach 0.35, the aural alert “TOO

Configuration
This mode provides an alert when the gear is down and the flaps are not in the landing

position, the aural alert of “TOO LOW FLAPS” is sounded.
When the envelope is penetrated at more than Mach 0.28, the aural alert of “TOO LOW 
TERRAIN” is sounded and the upper boundary of the envelope is increased to 1000 feet radio 
altitude.
The applicable voice message is repeated each 1.5 seconds until the flight condition has been

Ground Proximity Warning System
MODE 5 - Below Glide Slope Deviation Alert
This mode alerts the flight crew of a descent of more than 1.3 dots below an ILS glide slope. 
The envelope has two areas of alerting, soft and hard. In the soft area the alert is a reduced 
volume voice message of “GLIDE SLOPE”. In the hard area, (approximately 2 dots below 
the glide slope) a full volume “GLIDE SLOPE GLIDE SLOPE” occurs.  In both areas, the voice 
message repetition rate is increased as the glide slope deviation increases and the radio altitude 
decreases. The mode is armed when a valid signal is being received by the glide slope receiver, 
gear is down and the radio altitude is 1000 feet or less.
The mode may be cancelled or inhibited by pressing either pilot’s BELOW G/S light while below 
1000 feet radio altitude. The mode will re-arm when climbing above 1000 feet radio altitude. 
Mode 1 to 4 aural alerts and warnings have priority over mode 5 aural alerts, however both 
PULL UP and BELOW G/S lights could be illuminated at the same time.

MODE 6A - Below Selected Minimum Radio Altitude
Mode 6A provides an aural alert if a descent is made below the minimum decision altitude 
cursor in the radio altimeter. This mode operates between 50 and 1000 feet of radio altitude.
This alert is aural only and consists of “MINIMUMS, MINIMUMS” sounded once.
The mode is re-armed when the radio altitude becomes greater than that selected with the 
altitude cursor.

MODE 6B  Altitude Call-outs and Bank Angle Alert
Call-outs of selected altitudes and minimums is available. The call-outs used are a customer 
option but for example may consist of calls at 200 ft and 100 ft to decision height, or absolute 
height call-outs from the radio altimeter with respect to the ground.
Figure 34.10 MODE 6B
“BANK ANGLE” can be used to alert crews of excessive roll angles. The bank angles are not an 
aircraft manoeuvre limit, but rather a limitation decided upon by the airline. However, the limit 
reduces with proximity to the ground due to the reduced wing tip clearance to prevent wing 
tip or engine damage during take-off and landing.

MODE 7  Windshear Alerting
Visual and aural windshear warnings are given when several parameters such as ground 
speed, airspeed, barometric height and rate of descent and radio altitude, indicate the initial 
conditions of entering an area of windshear. Again as with the terrain threat display there is 
no scanning beam looking ahead to avoid the condition entirely. Rather the benefit from the 
system is derived from the fact that it allows the pilot to initiate the windshear go-around 
procedure earlier, giving the aircraft a greater probability of avoiding an accident. Mode 7 
warnings take priority over all other modes.

Action to Be Taken on Receiving a Warning
The response to all alerts or warnings should be positive and immediate; establishing the 
cause of GPWS activation should take second place.
There is a risk that repeated experience of unwanted alerts/warnings may reduce confidence 
in the system. Hence, flight crews should report ALL alerts/warnings to the operator thereby 
ensuring that appropriate analysis and remedial action can be taken. There is a GPWS operation 
reporting form for this purpose.
The immediate response to a warning must be to level the wings and to initiate a maximum 
gradient climb which should be maintained until the aircraft attains the minimum safe altitude 
for that part of the route being operated. Modification is permissible only in exceptional 
circumstances such as the necessity to follow a curved path for azimuth terrain avoidance.
When established in the climb every effort shall be made to determine the cause of the warning 
and to verify the aircraft’s position. The only circumstances when a climb to this altitude may 
be discontinued are when:
•	 The cause of the warning has been positively identified and the warning has ceased
•	 The aircraft is operated by day in clear visual conditions
•	 It is immediately obvious to the commander that the aircraft is not in a dangerous situation 
with regard to terrain, aircraft configuration or the present manoeuvre of the aircraft
Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS)
Terrain Awareness System (TAWS)
GPWS does not “look ahead” and any Mode 2 warning when flight is towards high ground will 
be dependent upon the steepness of the terrain. Hence, a sheer cliff ahead will not generate 
a mode 2 warning and any subsequent warning due to rising ground beyond the cliff will be 
delayed until the aircraft is over that ground. However, this limitation has been overcome by 
Enhanced GPWS with the Terrain Threat Display. This uses essentially an electronic map of 
the world (giving ground elevation) and information from the aircraft’s navigational system 
(be that INS/GPS or any combination). Given the location of the aircraft, its course and height 
(either from the ADC or derived from GPS) a display can be created showing the locations of 
terrain that could threaten the safety of the aircraft.
Using this system EGPWS can warn of approaching high terrain even when that terrain is not in 
close enough proximity to initiate a mode 2 warning. This terrain threat display and warning will 
be initiated in sufficient time to comfortably avoid any threat of flight into terrain (approx 40-
60 seconds for an alert, 20-30 seconds for a warning). The terrain is shown in shades of green, 
yellow and red and the display indicates terrain not only below the aircraft but also ahead of 
its flight path. At a certain time before predicted impact the warning will issue a “Caution 
Terrain” or “Terrain Ahead” message. If the system database has obstacle data the alert may 
be “Obstacle Ahead”. The threat terrain will turn solid yellow. If the situation is allowed to 
deteriorate so as to close further with the high ground, the second message “Whoop Whoop 
Pull Up” will sound and the most threatening terrain will turn solid red. This will happen at 
sufficient spacing to avoid impact with the terrain but this time using more positive control 
movements.

The accuracy of this display is, however, linked to the accuracy of the navigational equipment. 
A poor nav fix or a malfunctioning nav system will result in dangerously inaccurate display. 
Some pilots have been found to be using the threat display to “thread” their way through high 
terrain. This is, of course, a gross misuse of the system and is strongly advised against.
The terrain display can be selected by the pilot, or may be automatically activated whenever 
the terrain becomes a threat. The threat display may be incorporated with the weather radar 
display, the navigational display or it may have its own Plan Position Indicator (PPI).

Terrain Clearance Floor
This alerts the crew to possible premature descent for non-precision approaches regardless of 
aircraft configuration. It uses the present aircraft position with respect to the runway. Presently 
the EGPWS database is separate from the FMS, and therefore not subject to regular updates. 
This is likely to change in the future, especially when the Runway Awareness and Advisory 
System (RAAS) is in general use. This system is designed to enhance situational awareness on 
the ground, and reduce the likely-hood of runway incursions.

Integrity Testing
The GPWS is provided with built-in test equipment (BITE) which allows all its functions and 
visual/audible warnings to be tested prior to flight; the preflight BITE is inhibited in flight. The 
test is initiated by the pilot pressing the test switch.
During flight the system is continuously monitored to confirm its serviceability and any in-flight 
failure is automatically indicated on the flight deck. A short confidence check is possible while 
airborne, but this is not a full BITE check.
Inhibition of EGPWS Modes
The EGPWS must not be de-activated (by pulling the circuit breaker) except for approved 
procedures. Instructions on inhibition must include a statement that no person may de-activate 
the EGPWS except in accordance with the procedures stated in the Operations Manual.
•	 Inhibition of the glide slope mode may be desirable when a glide slope signal is present 
but the aircraft is deliberately being flown without reference to it, e.g. the pilot may 
have discontinued the ILS, to land on a different runway, or is performing a localizer only 
approach.
•	 Inhibition may also be required when the gear or flap position inputs are known to be 
non-standard.

Airborne Collision and Avoidance System
Introduction
Today’s higher traffic densities and greater speed differences have generated a need for 
an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. Although ICAO named it ACAS, the principle 
manufacturer in the US referred to its system as Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System 
(TCAS), and this name is now a widely accepted alternative. The system is designed to provide 
an additional margin of safety and keep commercial aircraft clear of conflict, independently 
of Air Traffic Control. An aircraft must carry a transponder and have the facility to interrogate 
other aircraft transponders. Presently there are four systems in use, I, II, III and IV, each with 
increasing levels of protection. All commercial air transport turbine powered aircraft registered 
in Europe greater than 5700 kg MTOM or with more than 19 passenger seats must have at least 
ACAS II (version 7). 
TCAS I
TCAS I is a first generation collision avoidance system and simply warns the crew of other 
traffic in the vicinity of their aircraft. It will detect and display range and approximate relative 
bearing. If the TCAS display aircraft and the intruder are carrying Mode C, relative altitude will 
also be displayed. It encourages flight crew to look for the conflicting traffic by generating 
visual and aural warnings - TRAFFIC ADVISORIES (TAs):
“Traffic, Traffic”.
It does not give any resolution advisory information, i.e. a course of action to follow.
TCAS II
TCAS II detects intruders in the TCAS aircraft’s vicinity, assesses the collision risk and presents 
warnings to the crew in the form of TAs and Resolution Advisories (RAs) e.g.
“Climb” “Increase Climb” “Descend” “Increase Descent” “Monitor Vertical Speed” “Decrease 
Climb” “Decrease Descent”
Thus, RAs offer manoeuvring advice in the vertical plane to resolve conflict. If your aircraft 
and the intruder both have Mode S data link transponders the system will co-ordinate the RAs 
to provide complementary vertical avoidance instructions. The rest of this chapter deals with 
TCAS II only and discusses both visual and audible TAs and RAs in detail.
Principle
TCAS II operates on the secondary radar principle using the normal SSR frequencies of 1030 
MHz and 1090 MHz, but in an air to air role. Using this principle the TCAS system creates two 
protective three dimensional bubbles around the TCAS equipped aircraft (Figure 35.1).

Aircraft Equipment
For aircraft to be visible to a TCAS equipped aircraft they must have a minimum of a Mode “A” 
Transponder. If the transponder is switched off, or is unserviceable, the intruding aircraft are 
invisible to the TCAS equipment and a collision risk exists. Mode A transponders transmit no 
height information and therefore the information available to the TCAS equipment is two 
dimensional only and therefore can only give TAs.
Mode “C” Transponder equipped intruders broadcast height information to the TCAS 
equipment and the system becomes three dimensional and can now give both TAs and RAs. 
Mode “S” Transponder TCAS equipped intruders as well as broadcasting height information 
allow a discrete data link to be established between them. This data link will allow avoidance 
manoeuvres to be mutually resolved.
Operation
The range of an intruder is determined by measuring the time lapse between transmission of 
an interrogation, and receiving the response (Radar Principle). An interrogation signal is sent 
out approximately once a second; however in densely populated airspace, where many aircraft 
are being monitored, a system of reduced surveillance is employed, where the interrogation 
period is extended to every 5 seconds, with priority given to the closest. Normal detection 
range is approximately 30 NM, reducing to 5 NM when operating reduced surveillance. The 
bearing of an intruder is determined by a directional antenna (Figure 35.2.). Because of the 
wavelengths involved and the necessarily small size of the antennas, bearing resolution is the 
least accurate parameter. TCAS II never offers collision avoidance commands in the horizontal 
plane; only in the form of climb or descend.

The relative height of an intruder is found by comparing its Mode “C” height with the TCAS 
equipped aircraft’s height.
Figure 35.2 TCAS Bearing determination
System Interconnections
Figure 35.3 shows a TCAS installation in a commuter/feeder airliner. The heart of the system is 
the TCAS receiver-transmitter-computer unit controlled by a combined ATC/SSR/TCAS control 
panel. The TCAS displays in this installation are a dedicated TCAS Plan Position Indicator (PPI), 
and the red and green sectors on the vertical speed tape of the Primary Flight Display (PFD). 
Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI). On other aircraft the symbols may be displayed 
on an electronic VSI, or the Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI/ND). A synthetic 
voice issues TCAS commands. 
The TCAS upper and lower antennas are directional while the Mode “S” antennas are omni- 
directional.
The TCAS also has feeds from the radio altimeter to modify the RAs received when in close 
proximity to the ground. There are no instructions given at all when the aircraft is below 
400 ft AGL, no descent RAs are given below 1000 ft AGL and no increase rate of descent 
commands below  1450 ft AGL. The system will also take aircraft configuration/performance 
into consideration when deciding an avoiding action. When the aircraft has gear and/or flap 
deployed its climb performance will be poor so TCAS will avoid giving climbing demands for an 
RA. A feed from the ADC tells the ACAS the aircraft’s height, so that, at high altitudes, it will 
not give a climbing RA if the aircraft is close to its performance ceiling. A further feed from the 
IRS gives inertial vertical acceleration.

Synthetic Voice Prioritization
Modern aircraft use a synthetic voice to give warning advice to the crew. The voice is used for 
various systems including windshear detection, ground proximity warnings, including height 
call-outs, and TCAS. The synthetic voice is prioritized as follows:
Stall Identification/Stall Prevention. (Stick-shake/Stick-push). The synthetic voice is inhibited 
during stick shake/stick push operation.
Windshear. The detection of performance decreasing windshear takes first priority with the 
synthetic voice, inhibiting both GPWS and TCAS warnings.
Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). Detection of approach to terrain takes priority 
over TCAS announcements.

Traffic Advisories (TAs) Resolution Advisories (RAs)
The TCAS can monitor a large number of aircraft simultaneously (up to 30 can be displayed) 
and can produce resolution advice against multiple conflicts. It bases advice on the target 
aircraft’s Closest Point of Approach, (CPA) which is denoted by the Greek letter T (tau) in 
calculations. (The calculations are not required knowledge and are therefore not included in 
this book). Depending upon the setting of the TCAS function switch on the control panel, 
the equipment level of intruder aircraft and the phase of flight of the TCAS aircraft, TCAS will 
generate the following.
a)	
Traffic Advisories (TAs) exist when an intruder penetrates the outer bubble caution 
area and is between 45 and 35 seconds from the collision area. TAs appear as solid 
amber circles on the TCAS display and are accompanied by the synthetic voice saying 
“Traffic, Traffic”. This is a potential collision threat.
b)	
Resolution Advisories (RAs) exist when an intruder penetrates the inner bubble 
warning area and is between 35 and 15 seconds from the collision area. RAs appear 
as solid red rectangles on the TCAS display accompanied by various synthetic voice 
warnings. RAs indicate a serious collision threat. (See Figure 35.4).

Resolution Advisories
It should be remembered that it is not the job of the ACAS system to maintain standard 
Air Traffic separation minima. If RAs are responded to smoothly and immediately, then the 
intended  vertical separation varies from 300 to 600 ft (700 above FL410) depending on the 
Sensitivity Level (SL) which decreases with altitude. 
Resolution Advisories come in two forms:
Preventative Advisories are situations where no collision risk exists unless a change of level is 
initiated by either aircraft. The synthetic voice advisory is “Monitor Vertical Speed”.
Corrective Advisories are situations where a collision risk exists and a manoeuvre is necessary 
to avert it. The synthetic voice produces the appropriate command.
Figure 35.5 shows examples of preventative and corrective RAs displayed on the vertical speed 
tape of the primary flight display.

Proximate Traffic/Other Traffic

Proximate Traffic appears as a solid cyan diamond and represents transponder 
equipped aircraft within 6 NM and within +/- 1200 feet relative height. TCAS does 
not consider this traffic a threat and displays it to improve crew situational 
awareness.

Other Traffic appears as hollow cyan diamonds which represent transponder 
equipped aircraft within range of the display and within +/- 2700 feet relative 
height (+8700/-2700 in the climb, +2700/-8700 in the descent. This being a function 
of the “Above/Below” switch). Again it is displayed to improve situational 
awareness.
The predicted flight paths of Proximate and Other Traffic do not penetrate the Collision Area 
of the TCAS aircraft.
Data Tag
If the intruding aircraft is transmitting mode C the traffic symbols will also have an associated 
altitude TAG which shows relative altitude in hundreds of feet. To indicate whether an intruder 
is climbing, flying level or descending:
A + sign indicates the intruder is above, - sign below.
A trend arrow ↑ or ↓ appears alongside the symbol when the intruder’s vertical rate is 500 feet 
per minute or greater.
No altitude number or trend arrow will appear beside an intruder that is non-altitude reporting. 
If TCAS II direction finding techniques fail to locate the azimuth of another aircraft a no bearing 
message appears on the screen.
Off Scale Traffic Advisory
When TCAS is tracking an intruder that is outside the selected display range, but has entered 
the caution or warning areas, one-half of the appropriate symbol will appear at the appropriate 
bearing at the edge of the display area. The symbol will appear in its proper colour and have its 
data tag displayed providing there is room. (See Figure 35.15).

Function Switch
•	 Standby - warm-up power is applied to the system, but it is not operational.
•	 On - the transponder only is operational (your aircraft will be visible to ACAS equipped 
aircraft).
•	 TA - the transponder and TCAS are now operational but only Traffic Advisories are 
generated. “TA ONLY” will be indicated on the TCAS display. TA would only be selected in 
accordance with specific procedures. For example, after an engine failure, when the aircraft 
performance is reduced or if parallel runway ops are in force.
•	 RA/TA - the transponder and TCAS are operational and both Resolution Advisories and 
Traffic Advisories are generated.
•	
•	 TEST - pressing the centre TEST button on the function switch initiates a full Built-in Test 
Equipment (BITE) of the system. After completion of a successful test the synthetic voice will 
respond with “TCAS SYSTEM TEST OK”. If the system test is unsuccessful the voice response 
is “TCAS SYSTEM TEST FAIL”.

No Bearing Advisories
If TCAS is unable to track the bearing of an 
intruder, possibly due to antenna screening, 
the RA or TA will appear lower centre of the 
display appropriately colour coded. Up to two 
lines of information can be displayed.
“TA 2.2- 04” means the intruder is creating a 
TA 2.2 NM away 400 below and the up arrow 
indicates the intruder is climbing at 500 fpm 
or greater.
It is important to realize that TCAS’s ability 
to compute a Traffic or Resolution Advisory is 
not degraded by lack of bearing information.

Action to Be Taken on Receiving TAs and RAs
•	 Action on Receiving a TA. TAs alert flight crews to the possibility that an RA may follow, 
which could require a flight path change. Flight crews should assimilate the information 
provided by the TA and commence a visual search of that part of the sky. They should also 
prepare to respond to an RA if the situation worsens. If the potential threat cannot be seen 
and continues to give cause for concern, flight crews should seek advice from ATC. Do not 
manoeuvre on the basis of a TA alone.
•	 Action on Receiving an RA. Pilots are to initiate the required manoeuvre immediately, 
adjusting flight path, aircraft power and trim accordingly. Crew members not involved in 
executing this manoeuvre should confirm that the sky ahead is clear of other aircraft and 
continue the visual search for the established threat. They are to inform ATC as soon as 
possible of any deviation from an ATC clearance. 
•	 Disregarding RAs. Manoeuvres should never be made in a direction opposite to that given 
in an RA; this is because the sense may have been determined following an exchange of 
data with the established threat. For this reason:
•	 RAs may be disregarded only when pilots visually identify the potentially conflicting 
traffic and decide no deviation from the current flight path is needed. 
•	 If pilots receive simultaneously an instruction to manoeuvre from ATC and an RA, and 
both conflict, the advice given by TCAS should be followed.

Flight Data Recorder
Introduction
Commercial aircraft have a flight recorder which records various aircraft parameters during the 
entire duration of the flight. The main function of the flight data recorder (FDR) is to preserve 
the aircraft data in order to determine the cause of any aircraft accident. It is also used to 
gather information for trend analysis and trouble shooting. In smaller aircraft the FDR may be 
combined with a cockpit voice recorder.
FDR Designs
The FDR records the last 10 or 25 hours of aircraft data on a digital storage device housed in a 
shock resistant box that is painted red and located at the rear of the aircraft, normally under 
the fin. On the front of the unit is an underwater locating device (ULD). 
FDR Components
The FDR consists of the following components (see Figure 36.1):
•	 a recording system
•	 a control unit on the overhead panel
•	 a control unit on the pedestal
•	 Data Interface and Acquisition Unit (DIAU)
Information from the DIAU is sent to the Aeroplane Condition Monitoring System (ACMS), 
together with inputs from aircraft systems, such as air conditioning, auto-flight, flight controls, 
fuel, landing gear, navigation systems, pneumatic systems, APU and engines. This information 
is used for system monitoring and trend analysis, and can be downloaded via the aircraft 
printer, or via ACARS or the ATSU.
The control unit on the overhead panel also controls the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). A spring-
loaded switch labelled GND CTL can be selected ON or AUTO as follows:
•	 ON	 	
The CVR and the DFDR are energized and the ON light is lit
•	 AUTO	
The CVR and the DFDR are energized:
•	 on the ground with one engine running
•	 in flight (with engine running or stopped).
The control on the pedestal consists simply of a push-button labelled ‘EVENT’ which sets an 
event mark on the DFDR recording. This acts as a kind of bookmark to enable the “event” to 
be found rapidly on the recording at a subsequent analysis.

down.

Aircraft Integrated Data Systems (AIDS)
AIDS processes data for various aircraft systems to ease maintenance tasks. This is done via a 
data management unit (DMU) that collects and processes data to compile reports for storage 
and for printing. Some of this information is sent to the FDR via the flight data interface 
unit (FDIU) for recording mandatory parameters of the flight. The rest of the information is 
recorded on a separate flight maintenance recorder from which data can be printed out for 
the purpose of maintenance.
Data stored on the DMU can be printed out both in flight as well as on the ground for the 
purpose of maintenance.
It is also possible to transmit relevant data from AIDS to ground at certain intervals so that the 
aircraft performance can be monitored from the ground. This is done via ACARS (Airborne 
Communications and Reporting System) on a VHF data link.

Parameters Recorded
The mandatory aircraft parameters recorded on the FDR depend upon the age and size of the 
aircraft and are specified in OPs Regulations.
The main parameters are:
•	 time or relative time count
•	 attitude (pitch and roll)
•	 airspeed
•	 pressure altitude
•	 heading
•	 normal acceleration
•	 propulsive thrust/power on each engine
•	 cockpit thrust/power lever position
•	 flaps/slats configuration or cockpit selection
•	 ground spoilers and/or speed brake selection
Additional parameters include the following:
•	 positions of primary flight controls and trim
•	 radio altitude and navigation information displayed to the flight crew
•	 cockpit warnings
•	 landing gear position
European Regulations
Carriage of FDR
FDR equipment is required to be carried on EU registered commercial air transport aircraft. The 
rules regarding carriage depend on a number of factors, i.e. number of passenger seats, type 
of propulsion, Maximum Take-off Mass (MTOM) and date of first registration, as follows;
•	 All aeroplanes over 5700 kg MTOM, or turbine powered less than 5700 kg but with more 
than 9 passenger seats, registered since 1 April 1998 (Referred to as case 1 in OPs Regulations)
•	 All aeroplanes >5700 kg MTOM registered since 1 June 1990 (case 2)
•	 All turbine powered aeroplanes >5700 kg MTOM registered before 1 June 1990 (case 3)
For the aircraft >5700 kg MTOM the minimum recording time is 25 hours, and all the main 
parameters listed previously must be recorded. For aircraft less than 5700 kg MTOM, (i.e. 
turbine powered, with more than 9 passenger seats registered after 1 April 1998) the recording 
time may be no less than 10 hours.
Aircraft >27 000 kg MTOM must also record the additional parameters.

Flight Data Recorder
Other Requirements	
The other regulatory requirements are:
•	 The FDR must start automatically to record the data prior to the aeroplane being capable of 
moving under its own power and must stop automatically after the aeroplane is incapable 
of moving under its own power. This is achieved by starting when the first engine is started, 
and automatically switching off 5 minutes after the last engine is shut down.
•	 The FDR must have a device to assist in locating that recorder in water.
•	 Aeroplanes of 5700 kg or less may have the FDR combined with the cockpit voice recorder. 
Aircraft above 5700 kg must have 2 recorders, either separate FDR/CVR, or 2 combined 
recorders.
•	 An aeroplane may be dispatched with an inoperative FDR provided that:
•	 it is not reasonably practicable to repair or replace the FDR before flight
•	 the aeroplane does not exceed 8 further consecutive flights
•	 not more than 72 hours have elapsed since the unserviceability
•	 any cockpit voice recorder required to be carried is operative (unless it is combined with 
the FDR)

Cockpit Voice Recorder
Introduction
The principal function of a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) system is to preserve, in the event 
of an air accident, vital information that is recoverable for use by the Accident Investigation 
Branch (AIB). The CVR automatically records the last 30 minutes (2 hours on some aircraft) 
of communications and conversations on the flight deck. It is operational whenever 
115 volts AC power is applied to the aircraft, any engine is running, or the aircraft is airborne. 
The system comprises a tape recorder, a control unit, a monitor display and an area microphone. 
The units and their locations are shown in Figure 37.1.
The Recording
The recorder is required, in accordance with OPs Regulations, to record from before the aircraft 
is capable of moving under its own power, until it is no longer able to do so. It should, however, 
also record pre-start procedures and post engine shut-down procedures. Parameters recorded 
are:
•	 voice communications transmitted from or received on the flight deck
•	 the aural environment of the flight deck
•	 voice communication of flight crew members using the aeroplanes interphone system
•	 voice or audio signals introduced into a headset or speaker
•	 voice communication of flight crew members using the PA system
The Voice Recorder
The tape recorder is located inside a crash-proof metal box that is painted red or orange and 
normally placed at the rear of the aircraft, often adjacent to the flight data recorder. The high 
impact case should be able to withstand shock, high temperature and fire.
On the front of the unit is fitted an underwater locating device (ULD), that will emit a continuous 
series of ultrasonic pulses to help locate a submerged CVR. The unit is automatically activated 
by water and the battery will last several days.

The Control Unit
This is mounted on the flight deck, usually in the roof panel. It contains monitoring and testing 
circuitry and also the area microphone to pick up general flight deck conversations and sounds. 
It has the following controls:
AUTO / ON	
When the switch is in the AUTO position the CVR will start to record when the 
first engine is started and will stop 5 minutes after the last engine is shut down. Selection of 
the ON position starts the CVR recording immediately and latches the switch in the ON position 
until first engine start, when it will click back to AUTO.

CVR TEST	
Pressing the TEST button activates an extensive set of functional tests which 
determine the integrity of the system using the BITE (built-in test equipment) facility. A 
successful self-test results in a visual ‘good’ indication (a status deflection needle or a status 
LED).
ERASE		
Erasure of the tapes is only possible with the aircraft on the ground, all engines 
stopped and the parking brake set. Suitable safety interlocks are installed to prevent inadvertent 
or airborne tape erasure. Additionally the erase button must be held depressed for at least 2 
seconds before the circuit activates.
Some CVR control units will incorporate the area microphone as shown in Figure 37.2.

European Regulations
The rules for commercial air transport aircraft registered in the EU regarding CVRs are similar 
to, but not identical to, the requirements for FDRs as follows:
•	 All aeroplanes registered after 1 April 1998 which are  >5700 kg MTOM or turbine powered, 
less than 5700 kg but with more than 9 passenger seats (Case 1)
•	 Turbine powered aeroplanes registered between 1 January 1990 and 31 March 1998 less 
than 5700 kg MTOM but with more than 9 passenger seats (Case 2)
•	 All aeroplanes with MTOM > 5700 kg (Case 3)
Minimum recording time is 30 minutes, except for aircraft >5700 kg MTOM registered after 1 
April 1998, where the minimum recording time is 2 hours.
Rules for despatch with an unserviceable CVR are the same as for an unserviceable FDR. Aircraft 
less than 5700 kg MTOM may carry a combined CVR/FDR, but if the recorders fitted to aircraft 
>5700 kg MTOM are combined, they must be fitted with two.

Engine Instrumentation
An Introduction to the Engine Instruments
Just as it would be impossible to fly a large modern aircraft safely without the flight instruments, 
so would it also be impossible to fly it safely without the engine and aircraft systems instruments.
The engine instruments are divided basically into two categories, Performance Indicators or 
Engine Condition Indicators.
Performance Indicators are thrust indicating instruments such as the Engine Pressure Ratio 
(EPR) gauge or the Fan Speed (N1) gauge.
Engine Condition Indicators include the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) gauge, Compressor 
Speed, Oil Pressure and Oil Temperature gauges. We will be discussing these and others in the 
following text.
Figure 38.1 shows some of the parameters previously mentioned and the position of the sensors 
that are required to measure them.

Engine Instrumentation
Types of Display
There are two types of cockpit display, the analogue display (clockwork cockpit) or the 
electronic display (glass cockpit). In the former, there are a multitude of gauges displaying 
information, in the latter the display is shown on cathode ray tubes (CRTs) or liquid crystal 
display panels (LCDs) with light emitting diodes (LEDs) for digital displays. A small number of 
conventional gauges are retained in case of failure of the electronic displays.
Both types of display convey essentially the same information to the pilot, but the flexibility of 
the glass cockpit system means that it is now taking over as the preferred means of showing 
both flight and engine instrumentation.
Thrust and Power Measuring Instruments
Thrust measuring instruments are of two basic types:
•	 the type that measures the jet pipe pressure, the P7 gauge.
•	 the type that measures the ratio of two parameters, the jet pipe pressure and the engine air 
intake pressure, the EPR gauge. (Figure 38.2)
•	 propeller-driven aircraft measure and indicate Torque. This is an indication of engine power. 
The propeller converts power into thrust.
On some large turbo-fan 
engines 
the 
integrated 
turbine discharge pressure 
and fan outlet pressure is 
compared to the compressor 
inlet pressure to produce 
what is called ‘integrated’ 
EPR.
Pitot 
tubes, 
suitably 
positioned, 
sense 
the 
pressures which are required 
to work the system; the tubes 
can either be connected 
directly 
to 
the 
indicator 
in the cockpit or to a 
pressure transmitter which is 
electrically connected to the 
indicator.
The P7 system gauge can be marked in inches of mercury (inHg), pounds per square inch (psi), 
or a percentage of the engine’s maximum thrust.
Although EPR can be indicated by either mechanical or electronic means, it is more normal to 
find the electronic system in use. This system uses two transducers which sense the relevant air 
pressures and vibrate at frequencies proportional to these pressures. A computer works out 
the electrical signal appropriate to the pressures and that signal is sent to the EPR gauge in the 
cockpit and to the engine management system.

Engine Instrumentation
The engine intake pressure will vary with changing ambient pressure and also with changing 
airspeed. An increase in forward airspeed during take-off will cause a drop in the reading on 
the EPR gauge. This is only an ‘apparent drop’ because it is only the ratio of two pressures, 
engine intake pressure and the jet pipe pressure, which is changing.
This apparent change is caused by a relative increase of the engine intake pressure with forward 
airspeed during take-off. The jet pipe pressure, being unaffected at low airspeeds, causes the 
ratio between the two pressures to fall.
This will be seen as a reduction in EPR on the gauge, which might cause the inexperienced 
engine operator to open the throttles further in an attempt to restore the loss, having eyes 
for only the one parameter, while the other parameters, (N1, N2, N3 & EGT) are in danger of 
exceeding their limits without his knowledge.
In an attempt to prevent this happening, most operators require that EPR is set before the 
aircraft has reached approximately 60 knots, no increase in engine power being allowed unless 
in emergency after this speed.
After take-off, as the airspeed increases beyond V2, the increase in engine intake pressure is 
passed through the engine to the jet pipe, so changing the ratio back to that set on take-off.
Engine Torque
Turboprops and turboshaft engines produce torque rather than thrust. The systems that 
produce indications of thrust for turbojet engines and turbofan engines are vastly different 
to those which produce indications of torque for turboprop and turboshaft engines. The 
torquemeter measures, and its indicator displays, the power being produced by the engine. 
Torque, by definition, is a force applied at a distance to a turning point. If applied to the PLANE 
formula given in Piston Engines Chap 1, the turning force is the product of the mean effective 
pressure P acting on the area of the piston A at distance L (the stroke is twice the throw of the 
crank) Therefore P, L & A can be replaced by the word Torque. N represents the number of 
cylinders and will remain constant, the only other variable is E the number of effective power 
strokes or rpm of the engine. Power can therefore also be expressed as Torque × rpm.
There are two main methods employed in measuring the torque of the engine. One uses oil 
pressure and the second is an electronic device. The units of measurement vary from system 
to system. The indicator gauges may be calibrated to read psi, inch or foot pounds, newton 
metres, brake or shaft horsepower, or percentage of maximum. Torque is measured between 
the engine and the reduction gearbox.
The oil torquemeter system makes use of a phenomenon that axial thrust (movement) is 
generated when helically cut gears are used to transfer power from one shaft to another. 
Figure 38.3 shows how this end thrust can be utilized to provide an indication of the torque 
output of a turboprop or turboshaft engine.
As the gears in the propeller reduction gearbox rotate to drive the propeller, the amount of 
torque that they are transmitting attempts to move them axially. this axial force is proportional 
to the torque that is producing it.
The gears cannot be allowed to move axially because this would cause the teeth to no longer 
mesh with each other and the drive would fail, so the axial force has to be counteracted to 
maintain the gears in alignment. The force comes from passing engine oil through a filter and
--- Page 524 ---

then to a torquemeter pump which enables its pressure to be boosted to (in some cases) as 
much as 800 psi. This high pressure is allowed into cylinders which form the bearings within 
which the helical gear shafts rotate.
A small bleed hole in the wall of the cylinder will be covered by the gear shaft if it moves into 
the cylinder under increasing axial load, and this will cause the oil pressure within the cylinder 
to build up until it can move the gear shaft back to its original position. Conversely, if the load 
on the helical gear shaft decreases, the existing oil pressure will force its shaft slightly out of the 
cylinder. This uncovers the bleed hole allowing the balancing oil pressure to be reduced and so 
the gear shaft moves back into correct position within the cylinder.
If the oil pressure balancing the axial force is measured, it can be compared with reference 
figures which take into account the ambient pressure and temperature, and the performance 
of the engine, its power output, can be judged
Figure 38.3 The torquemeter system
The electronic system comprises two concentric shafts. One, the Torque Shaft, is connected 
to both the engine and the propeller’s reduction gear box. The second shaft, the Reference 
Shaft, is connected only to the engine. An exciter wheel (toothed gear) is formed at the forward 
end of each shaft. The exciter wheels rotate past an electromagnetic pick-up and produce an 
AC voltage. The exciter wheels are aligned at assembly, but as power is increased the torque 
shaft twists; this displaces the phase relationship of the voltages produced. The displacement 
is proportional to the change in power and is used to drive an indicator. This system is simple, 
and lighter than other systems, and it has proven to be very reliable in service. (Figure 38.4)
The torque indicator may indicate negative (windmilling propeller) as well as positive torque. 
The torque limits are colour coded and shown on the gauge. A red coloured band or marker 
indicates maximum limits. On a FADEC system these limits may be adjusted and set by the crew, 
and the indication can be presented in a digital read-out.

Engine rpm
The measurement of engine speed is of vital importance since, together with other parameters, 
accurate control and monitoring of the engine can be achieved. On piston engines it is crankshaft 
speed that is measured, whilst on gas turbine engines it is the speed of the compressor. The 
rpm indicator is called a Tachometer (Tacho). There are three basic methods of measuring 
engine rotational speeds:
•	 Mechanical (Magnetic) Tachometer.
•	 Electrical Generator System. (Tacho Genny)
•	 Inductive Probe System.
There are no firm guidelines as to the application of each of the tachometer systems, although 
engine and aircraft design will dictate which system can be best utilized.
The Mechanical Tachometer (Figure 38.5) is now only found on older piston aircraft. It consists 
of a Flexible Drive Shaft that is connected to the flight deck Tacho-indicator. The input drive 
causes a magnet in the indicator to rotate. The magnet rotates inside a copper or aluminium 
drag-cup; this induces Eddy Currents in the drag-cup which oppose the magnetic field of 
the magnet. A torque is established which turns the drag-cup in the same direction as the 
permanent magnet. A shaft extends from the drag-cup and is connected to a pointer. The 
turning motion of the pointer is against the tension of a Hairspring which controls the drag-
cup position and hence the position of the pointer. The flexible drive is driven at reduced 
speed, but true speed will be shown on the indicator. The indicator incorporates compensation 
devices for change in temperature.

The Electrical Generator System (Figure 38.6) is possibly the oldest form of engine speed 
measurement still in use on large aircraft. It utilizes a small three phase (tacho) generator, 
driven by the engine. The output of this generator is then taken to an indicator which consists 
of an asynchronous motor turning a drag-cup assembly which moves a pointer over a scale as 
in the mechanical system.
Figure 38.6 Tacho-generator
The indicator (Figure 38.7) can either show the actual revolutions per minute (not too common), 
or the speed as a percentage of maximum engine speed.
Figure 38.7 Percentage tacho-indicator
On twin or triple spool engines the speed of rotation of the high, intermediate and low pressure 
compressors can be displayed. These would be termed N3, N2 and N1 (N being the SI symbol 
for rotational speed). N1 and EPR are the parameters used to measure thrust in turbojets.
An overspeed pointer (trailing or limit pointer) can also be fitted concentrically with the main 
pointer, and is initially positioned at the appropriate max rpm graduation. If the main pointer 
exceeds this position, the limit pointer is carried with it. When speed is reduced the limit pointer 
will remain at the maximum speed reached. It can be reset by applying a separate 28 V DC 
supply to a solenoid in the indicator.
Although there would always be provision on the HP compressor spool for driving a tacho- 
generator through the high speed gear box, facilities may not always be available for driving 
tacho-generators from the intermediate and low pressure compressor shafts. If this is the case, 
a Speed Probe, shown in Figure 38.8 and Figure 38.9, can be used to very good effect.

Figure 38.8  Measuring engine speed with a phonic wheel and a speed probe
The speed probe is positioned on the compressor casing in line with either a phonic wheel 
(Figure 38.8), or the actual fan blades (Figure 38.9). As the spool rotates, the magnetic flux in 
the probe or sensor head is altered. This changes the current flowing in the coil fitted inside the 
probe and the frequency with which it changes is directly related to the spool speed. This 
frequency is fed to an indicator in the cockpit to show the spool rotational speed.
In addition to providing an 
indication of spool speed, 
the tacho-generator or speed 
probe can both be used to 
provide a signal which will 
illuminate a warning lamp 
on the engine start control 
panel. This can tell the pilot 
not only that the engine is 
turning, but also whether 
the engine is turning in the 
correct 
direction. 
This 
is 
particularly important during 
engine start as it is used to 
inform the pilot when to open 
the HP Fuel Cock. This lamp is 
only illuminated during the 
start cycle.
An advantage of this system is 
the reduction in moving parts 
required in the engine, and 
that a number of separate 
electrical outputs additional 
to those required for speed 
indications can be provided, e.g. automatic power control and flight data acquisition systems.

The tacho-indicators mentioned in the text above receive their speed signals directly from 
speed sensors or via servo-operated systems. These indicators require a power source from the 
aircraft airborne power supply. In the event of power supply or signal failure, the indicator is 
returned to an Off Scale position, and a Power Off Flag may be displayed.
As previously stated, presentation of speed is now usually displayed as a percentage figure. It is 
only piston engine aircraft where the actual speed of rotation is displayed. Gas turbine engines 
have dial displays which show percentage speed, with 100% corresponding to the optimum 
turbine speed. Two scales are displayed. A main scale is calibrated 0 to 100% in 10% increments. 
A second pointer or digital counter displays speed in 1% increments. As well as digital read out, 
vertical ribbon displays are used.
In line with other instruments, coloured arcs or indicator lines are used to show ranges and 
limits of engine speed. Green represents normal operating range, with amber denoting caution. 
Red shows maximum or minimum speed, and ranges that are restricted because of excessive 
vibration. On a piston engine the reference rpm should also be placarded.
On multi-engine aircraft, to reduce structural vibration and noise the speed of all engines must 
be synchronized. It is impractical to have the pilot adjust the throttle of each engine manually 
to synchronize the speed, and individual indicators may vary in accuracy. In order to facilitate 
manual adjustment of speed an additional instrument known as a Synchroscope (Figure 38.10) 
is used. The instrument was designed at the outset for operation from the AC generated by the 
tachometer system. The instrument provides qualitative indication of the difference in speeds 
between two or more engines. One engine is selected as a master, the others are slaves to 
it. The instrument shows clearly whether a slave engine is running faster or slower than the 
master. An example of the dial presentation for synchroscopes for a twin and four-engine 
aircraft, and combined tacho and synchroscope are shown.

Temperature Sensing Equipment
Piston and gas turbine aero engines are heat engines. The power they produce is directly 
proportional to the heat released during combustion of fuel. Engine components and systems 
are designed to withstand certain temperatures. If their limits are exceeded, they may fail. 
To allow safe operation the engine temperatures must be monitored. The effect of ambient 
temperatures as well as combustion must be considered. The following temperatures are 
monitored on piston and gas turbine engines: air inlet, piston cylinder heads, piston exhaust 
gas, gas turbine compressor outlets, turbines oil and fuel systems and internal air system.
The temperatures monitored may range from -56°C to +1200°C. Different sensors are used 
depending on the temperature range to be monitored. They fall broadly into two categories; 
high temperatures and low temperatures.
There are four major types of measuring devices. They are:
Expansion Type
This relies on the principle that most solids, liquids and gases expand and contract with 
temperature changes, e.g. the mercury thermometer and bimetallic strip.
Vapour Pressure Type
Liquids when subjected to a rise in temperature change their state from liquid to vapour. 
Therefore by measuring the pressure of the vapour an indication of temperature can be gained.
Electrical Type
A change in temperature of an electrical conductor can cause a change in resistance of the 
conductor. Thus measuring the change in resistance can indicate the temperature of the 
conductor. This sensor is called the Resistance Type (temperature bulb). In addition, two 
dissimilar metals when joined together at their ends (a junction) can produce an electrical 
potential called a thermo EMF (Seebeck Effect). This is dependent on the temperature difference 
between the junctions. This is known as a ‘Thermo-electric Type’ or ‘Thermo-couple’. This 
system is explained in detail later.
Radiation Type
The radiation emitted by any body at any wavelength is dependent upon the temperature 
of that body. This is termed its ‘emissivity’. If the radiation is measured and the emissivity is 
known, the temperature of the body can be determined. Such a measuring technique is known 
as Pyrometry.
Generally the expansion and vapour pressure sensors are used to indicate lower temperatures. 
They are direct reading, e.g. thermometer. The electrical and radiation sensors are used to 
measure higher temperatures and can be direct reading to a moving coil Indicator, e.g. piston 
engine exhaust gas temperature. However, most systems today use remote sensors that feed 
to servo-operated indicators after the signal from the sensor has been amplified. A Ratiometer- 
type indicating system can be used to obtain the greater accuracy required when indicating 
the temperature of critical component e.g. turbines.
The temperature of the gas passing through the turbine in a gas turbine engine is the most 
important parameter of those displayed on the engine instruments. Operation of the engine 
beyond the limits of turbine temperature, even for only a moment, is liable to cause excessive 
turbine blade creep which can be catastrophic if the rotating blades touch the casing of the 
engine.

Engine Instrumentation
The gas temperature must be monitored closely and automatic temperature limiting equipment 
is fitted to most gas turbine engines operating today. To enable this monitoring to be achieved 
temperature probes are inserted in the gas stream.
Temperature probes are formed from the junction of two dissimilar metals; when heated the 
junction generates a small voltage which is proportional to the actual temperature which 
produced it. The voltage can be measured on a milli-voltmeter and displayed in the cockpit as 
the temperature at the rear of the engine. A Galvanometer is a very sensitive instrument used 
to indicate these low voltages. The galvanometer uses a basic Wheatstone Bridge Balancing 
circuit that alters the magnetic field in a coil; this change produces a torque to drive an indicator.
Figure 38.11 The gas flow over the probes and their electrical connections
Figure 38.11 shows how the probes, the hot junctions, are connected and also how the gas 
flows over them. The output from the probes is sent to the cockpit engine instrument, which is 
the cold junction, where the EMF is measured on a very sensitive milli-voltmeter to display the 
engine gas temperature.
Just one probe would obviously not supply enough information to accurately tell the pilot 
what was going on in the whole turbine, it could only inform him about the small part of the 
turbine that it was monitoring. It is therefore necessary to place a number of probes, electrically 
connected in parallel, all around the periphery of the engine or the exhaust system. This means 
that the gas stream is sampled in many more places and that the output is the average of all 
of the probes. This has an added advantage that if one probe is damaged, the effect on the 
reading on the gauge is minimal (a slight drop may occur). The actual position of the probes 
depends upon two things: the anticipated maximum temperature of the gas and the ability of 
the probe material to withstand that temperature.
--- Page 532 ---

Engine Instrumentation
The industry standard for the material used in the temperature probes in gas turbine engines 
is chromel (nickel chromium) and alumel (nickel aluminium). These two materials may not have 
the highest milli-voltage output of the materials available, but their ability to withstand very 
high temperatures coupled with a reasonable volts per degree ratio makes them ideal for the 
job.
Figure 38.12 Thermocouple indicating system
Note: The system requires no power supply to indicate temperature however, if the signal is to 
be used to supply a temperature limiting system, the voltage will need to be amplified. This will 
be supplied by the aircraft’s electrical system.
In the case of a system that supplies both a temperature limiting system (top temperature 
control) and a temperature indicating system, the probes will contain two hot junctions, one 
to feed the limiter and one to feed the indicator. As illustrated in Figure 38.11.
The positioning of the probes within the engine depends on the temperature of the gas and 
the ability of the metal they are made of to withstand it. On engines where the temperature 
of the gas within the turbine is too high for the metal of the probes to withstand, they may 
be positioned after the turbine and the gauge calibrated to read ‘exhaust gas temperature’ 
(EGT). On other engines, it may be found convenient to combine the temperature probes with 
the pitot probes which measure exhaust gas pressure (P7), in this case the gauges will read ‘jet 
pipe temperature’ (JPT).
Obviously it would be ideal if the temperature could be sampled either before the turbine, 
called either ‘turbine inlet temperature’ (TIT) or ‘turbine entry temperature’ (TET), or inside 
the turbine, called ‘turbine gas temperature’ (TGT). In every case the position of the probes is 
dependent upon their ability to withstand the temperatures they encounter.
Actual blade temperature can be measured by the radiation method, with the use of an optical 
or pyrometer.

Engine Instrumentation
Air temperature is one of the basic parameters used to establish data vital to the performance 
monitoring of aircraft engines, e.g. thrust settings, fuel/air ratios settings etc. The temperature 
ideally required is that sensed at static conditions at various flight levels. This is called Static Air 
Temperature (SAT). However, this is not possible for all types of aircraft or, in many instances, 
for one type of aircraft, for the measurements can be affected by the adiabatic compression 
with increased speed. Below Mach 0.2 the temperature is very close to SAT, but at higher Mach 
numbers an increase in skin friction will raise the air temperature. This increase is commonly 
referred to as ‘Ram Rise’, and the temperature indicated called Ram Air Temperature (RAT) i.e. 
SAT plus the ram rise. The ram rise can be calculated mathematically as a function of Mach No. 
and for each type of aircraft tables or graphs can be included in flight manuals, or computed 
by air data computers to correct the indicators to SAT. The proportion of ram rise dependent 
on the ability of the sensor to sense or recover the temperature rise. The sensitivity in this case 
being expressed as a percentage and termed Recovery Factor. If for example , a sensor has a 
recovery factor of 0.80, it will measure SAT plus 80% of the ram rise.
For use at high Mach numbers, Total Air Temperature (TAT) is measured. The air is brought to 
rest (or nearly so) without addition or removal of heat. The temperature probes used have a 
high recovery factor (approximately 100%). TAT is equal to SAT + Ram Rise.
Temperature indicators use coloured arcs to show their operating range: green for normal, 
amber for caution and red for upper or lower limits.
Pressure Gauges
In many of the systems associated with the operation of the aircraft and its engines, liquids 
and gases are used, the pressures of which must be measured and indicated. The gauges and 
indicating systems fall into two categories: Direct Reading and Remote Indicating. Remote 
indicating is where a separate sensing element is connected to a pressure source at some 
remote point.
Pressure is defined as force per unit area. It is normally indicated either as pounds per square 
inch (psi) or inches of mercury (inHg); however, the measures of bar (1 bar = 14.5 psi) and 
pascal (1 bar = 100 000 pa) are sometimes referred to in aircraft manuals. 
In connection with pressure measurement we are concerned with the following terms: Absolute 
Pressure and Gauge Pressure. Most pressure gauges measure the difference between absolute 
pressure and the atmospheric pressure. This is gauge pressure.
To actually measure pressure in a system, Elastic Pressure Sensing Elements are used in which 
forces can be produced by applied pressures and converted to mechanical movement. The 
movement can then operate a direct reading gauge or electrical transmitter. The sensing 
elements commonly used are Diaphragms, Capsules, Bellows and Bourdon tubes.

Diaphragms (Figure 38.13) consist of corrugated circular metal discs which are secured at their 
edge, and when pressure is applied they are deflected. Diaphragms are used to measure low 
pressures.
Figure 38.13 A diaphragm pressure sensor
Capsules (Figure 38.14) are made up of two diaphragms placed together and joined at their 
edges to form a chamber which may be sealed, called an Aneroid, or open to a pressure source 
and called a Pressure capsule. Like diaphragms they are used to measure low pressure, but 
they are more sensitive to small pressure changes.
Figure 38.14  Pressure and aneroid capsules
The bellows (Figure 38.15) type element can be considered as an extension of the corrugated 
diaphragm principle. It may be used for high, low or differential pressure measurement. It is 
typically used to measure pressures like the aircraft’s LP booster pump output.
Figure 38.15 Bellows sensors
The Manifold Absolute Pressure Gauge or MAP (Figure 38.16) of a piston engine measures 
both pressure and differential pressure. Note this gauge measures Absolute Pressure and

indicates inches of mercury (inHg). When the engine is running this gauge can indicate less 
than atmospheric pressure. Earlier versions of this gauge were calibrated to read Boost in psi 
and called Boost Gauges. Under standard conditions the boost gauge will read ‘zero’ and the 
MAP gauge will read 30 inHg. This indication is called Static Boost.
The Bourdon tube (Figure 38.17) is about the oldest of the pressure-sensing elements. The 
element is essentially a length of metal tube with an elliptical cross-section shaped into a letter 
C. One end of the tube is sealed and called the free end. The other end is connected to the 
pressure source and fixed. When pressure is applied the tube tries to straighten; this movement 
is magnified to drive an indicator pointer. The Bourdon tube can be manufactured to indicate 
high or low pressures but is normally associated with higher pressures such as engine oil 
pressure.

It would be impractical to run an oil feed pipe from the outer engine of a Boeing 747 to a 
flight deck pressure indicator of the Bourdon tube type. To overcome this problem remote- 
indicating systems are used. They consist of two main components: a transmitter unit located 
at the pressure source and an indicator mounted on the appropriate panel. They have distinct 
advantages over direct reading gauges; for example, the pressure of hazardous fluids can 
be measured at their source and not brought into the cockpit. Also weight can be saved by 
reducing the length of pipelines. The transmitters feed varying current to an indicator and can 
be AC or DC in operation. These systems are covered later.
As well as indicating actual pressures, warnings can be displayed to the pilot by pressure 
operated switches. These switches can operate for low, high or incorrect differential pressures. 
A differential switch or gauge is subjected to pressure on both sides of its sensor.
Coloured arcs of green, amber or red are used to indicate the range and limits of the system.
Engine Vibration
Vibration monitoring equipment (VME) is fitted to almost all commercial jet engined aircraft. 
Although gas turbine engines have an extremely low vibration level, any change in that level is 
usually indicative of damage which may lead to failure.
Warnings will be given in the cockpit if the vibration levels are exceeded and some systems 
have a continuous read-out of vibration levels.
The latest engines have the facility whereby the vibration level of each rotating assembly is 
monitored so that the source of the vibration can be pinpointed.
The principle upon which VME works requires either an input from a Piezoelectric crystal 
mounted strategically on the engine, or an input from a coil which will be affected by the 
movement of a Magnet mounted loosely within it. In either case, the frequency of the incoming 
vibrations will be filtered so that only those frequencies that are indicative of damage occurring 
will affect the output.
These systems utilize the principle that the magnet and piezo crystal, which are suspended 
within a fixed coil carrying 115 volts at 400 hertz, will move in sympathy with any vibration 
suffered by the engine. This will affect the current flowing through the coil into the amplifier 
and filter. The filter will erase any output which is normal to the engine and allow through to 
the amplifier any frequency that is considered to be harmful to the engine.
The result of this amplification is sent to the instrument via the rectifier and warning circuit. The 
needle will show the appropriate deflection for the amount of vibration being suffered by the 
engine at that time. If the level of vibration exceeds a predetermined amount, a warning light 
on the instrument illuminates. Vibration is measured and displayed in ‘Relative Amplitude’ 
(Rel Ampl).

Fuel Gauge
The measurement of the quantity of fuel in the tanks of an aircraft fuel system is an essential 
requirement, and in conjunction with measurements of the rate at which the fuel flows to the 
engine or engines it permits an aircraft to be flown at maximum efficiency.
There are two principal methods of indicating the quantity of fuel carried. Either the Volume 
(e.g. gallons) or Mass (kg or lb) are measured. The former is now only used on light aircraft 
as the Mass of the fuel is of more interest to the pilot. This assists the pilot in calculating the 
aircraft’s ‘all-up-weight ‘ and also gives a better indication of the energy that can be released 
by the fuel. One pound of fuel has the same number of energy molecules regardless of 
temperature and volume.
The simplest form of volume indication is a float system. Early aircraft had a float which sat on 
the level of fuel. Attached to the float was a piece of wire that protruded out the top of the 
fuel tank. As the fuel level reduced so the wire disappeared from view. There have been many 
variations of this system. The most common of these is where the float moves to reposition a 
wiper on a variable resistor which alters the current to an indicator moving a pointer over a 
scale calibrated in volume. This is a DC powered system. (Figure 38.19)
--- Page 538 ---

The disadvantage of this system is that fuel tanks are rarely a symmetrical shape, therefore the 
float level is not a true measure of quantity. The gauge is set to be accurate at the low and 
empty positions. The system is also subject to errors whenever the aircraft manoeuvres and the 
attitude changes.
Figure 38.19 DC float type system
Capacitance Type Fuel Gauge System 
In its basic form a capacitance system (Figure 38.20) consists of a variable AC capacitor located 
in the fuel tank (Tank Unit Figure 38.21), an amplifier and an indicator. This system will indicate 
volume without the errors of the float system. If a correction voltage due to change in volume 
or temperature change is fed to the circuit, Mass of fuel will be indicated. A tank unit consists 
of two concentric aluminium alloy tubes which are held apart by pairs of insulating pins. The 
electrical connections are insulated and the unit is insulated from the tank. Co-axial connectors 
are used throughout.
Incorporated in the system are Reference units, which improve indication errors that would 
occur if the permittivity of the fuel changes from its normal value. The reference unit is located 
on the lower end of a tank unit and is always totally submerged in the unusable fuel level in 
the tank.

The principle of operation of the capacitance system is based on the use of fuel and air as 
the dielectric between parallel-plate capacitors of fixed area and a fixed distance between 
the plates. The only variable then being the ratio of fuel and air, which is determined by the 
quantity of fuel in the tank. Capacitance is measured in farads, the standard unit being the 
picofarad (10-12 farads). The capacitance depends on the following.
Capacitance   =   Relative Permittivity  ×    
Area of plates
Distance between plates

Figure 38.21 Capacitance tank unit
The Relative Permittivity (Er) is a number given as a ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor 
having a certain material as a dielectric to the capacitance of the same capacitor with a vacuum 
(or air) as its dielectric.
In an aircraft fuel system, the area of the plates and their distance apart remain constant, but 
the capacitance of the tank units will vary depending upon the level of fuel within the tanks.
The value of capacitance of a tank can be considered as two components. Ca (air) and Cf (fuel) 
and at any instance Tank Capacitance (Ct) = Ca + Cf. (Figure 38.22).

The pointer in the fuel quantity system measuring fuel by volume is directly related to:
•	 The change in fuel level.
•	 the ER- 1 value.
In an AC capacitance circuit the current is equal to the voltage over the capacitive reactance.
I (Current)    =   
V
Xc
  (Voltage) 
	
	
	
(Capacitive Reactance)
The capacitive reactance Xc is equal to 1/(2π f c). Since the voltage, frequency and 2π are 
constants, as the fuel level and capacitance change current in the circuit changes.
Changes in temperature of the fuel will affect its density, volume and dielectric value (Er). A 
decrease in temperature would cause a decrease in volume, increase in density and increase in 
Er. The circuit is compensated for changes in temperature and can now indicate mass of fuel 
which is of more value to the pilot.
For the calibration of gauges in terms of mass, an assumption is made that there is a constant 
relationship between Er value and density (ρ) for a given sample of fuel at a given temperature. 
Temperature of course is not a constant and a Compensating Capacitor circuit is incorporated 
in the system. This is fitted to the reference unit. The system will now sense changes in Specific 
Gravity (SG) of the fuel and so indicate mass.
The indicating system can incorporate an additional indicator known as the ‘Fuel Totalizer’ 
which will indicate the sum of all the tank gauges. In the event of failure, the system will fail 
safe and drive the indicator slowly to the zero position. A test circuit is incorporated that when 
selected will simulate the emptying of the tank. When the switch is released the pointer should 
return to its original position.
If water is present in the tanks it will cause errors with the indicating system. The capacitors in 
the sensing units are effectively shorted, and the indicator is driven beyond the full scale.
If the unusable fuel supply for any tank exceeds one gallon, or 5% of the tank capacity, 
whichever is greater, a red arc must be marked on its indicator extending from the calibrated 
zero reading to the lowest reading obtainable in flight.

Engine Instrumentation
As well as the quantity of fuel measured, the rate of fuel consumed and the instantaneous rate 
of fuel flow can be shown. The Fuel Flowmeter can display volume flow or mass flow. Flow is 
proportional to the square root of pressure drop across an orifice. A simple flowmeter can be 
an adaption of a pressure gauge. This is used on many light piston engine injection systems. 
Most modern engines use an electrical sensor, which utilizes the change in torque or speed 
of a turbine (impeller). Typical construction consists of a light alloy casting with guide vanes 
and an electrical ‘pick-off ‘coil. Inside the casting there is a helical vane impeller which has a 
magnet embedded in it. When the impeller rotates due to fuel flow, the pick-off coils will have 
a sinusoidal signal induced in it, at a frequency proportional to the speed of the rotor, which 
is proportional to the rate of volume flow. To measure mass flow the signal is corrected for 
temperature. (Figure 38.23)
The total consumption is obtained by integrating the rate of fuel consumption over time, this 
time is one hour. Units used for volume flow are gallons/hour or litres/hour, and for mass flow 
pounds/hour or kilograms/hour. A flowmeter that displays fuel consumed as well as fuel flow 
is broadly defined as an Integrated flowmeter. The flowmeter is located in the high pressure 
fuel line to the fuel spray nozzles (burners).

Remote (Signal) Transmission System
To control an aircraft system may require the movement of a valve, flap or lever on the 
engine. The pilot may need to know the position of the control. Early systems had Mechanical 
Feedback to a position indicator in the flight deck. Most of the aircraft flying today employ 
remote indicating systems that can be either DC or AC operated. Whichever system is used each 
data transmission system employs a Transmitter located at the source to be measured and a 
Receiver, which acts on the information received.

Some aircraft have a time monitor to record usage of the engines and systems in flight. This 
can be automatically switched via the “weight-on-wheels” switch or, more commonly, by an

Electronic Instruments for Engine and Airframe Systems Control
The display of the parameters associated with engine performance and airframe systems control 
by means of Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) or LCD type display has, like those of flight instrument 
systems, become a standard feature of many types of aircraft.
The display units form part of two principal systems designated as Engine Indicating and Crew 
Alerting System (EICAS), and Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) system. These 
systems were first introduced in Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft and the Airbus A310 respectively.
At the time of their introduction there were differing views on the approach to such operating 
factors as flight deck layouts and crews’ controlling functions, the extent to which normal, 
alerting and warning information should be displayed, and in particular, whether engine 
operating data was required to be displayed for the whole of a flight, or only at various phases.
In respect of EICAS, engine operating data is displayed on screens, thereby eliminating the 
need for traditional instruments.
This data, as well as that relevant to other systems, is not necessarily always on display but in 
the event of malfunctions occurring at any time, the flight crew’s attention is drawn to them 
by an automatic display of messages in the appropriate colours.
The ECAM system, on the other hand, displays systems’ operation in checklist and schematic 
form, and as this was a concept based on the view that engine data needed to be displayed 
during the whole of a flight, traditional instruments were retained in the Airbus A310.
It is of interest to note, however, that in subsequent types produced by this manufacturer, e.g. 
A320, the ECAM system is developed to include the display of engine data in one of its display 
units.
Smaller  aircraft with electronic flight decks, where space is limited, may have more compact 
displays, rather than the 6 screen layout common in most Airbus and Boeing aeroplanes. These 
may include EFIS for flight instruments, and a seperate Engine and Warning Display (EWD) or 
electronic flight Instruments combined with engine indications on a combined Multi-function 
Display Unit (MFDU).
EICAS
The basic EICAS system comprises two display units, a control panel, and two computers 
supplied with analog and digital signals from engine and system sensors as shown in the 
schematic functional diagram of Figure 39.1.
The computers are designated ‘Left’ and ‘Right’, and only one is in control at a time; the other 
is on ‘standby’. In the event of failure it may be switched in either manually or automatically. 
Operating in conjunction with the EICAS system are discrete caution and warning lights, standby 
engine indicators and a remotely-located panel for selecting maintenance data displays.
The system provides the flight crew with information on primary engine parameters (full-time), 
with secondary engine parameters and warning, caution and advisory alert messages displayed 
as required.

Figure 39.1 The EICAS functional diagram
Display Units
The display units provide a wide variety of information relevant to engine operation, and 
operation of other automated systems, and they utilize colour shadow mask CRTs and associated 
card modules whose functions are identical to those of the EFIS units. The units are mounted 
one above the other as shown in Figure 39.2.
The upper unit displays the primary engine parameters, N1 speed, EGT, and warning and 
caution messages.
In some cases this unit can also display EPR, depending on the type of engines installed and on 
the methods used to process data by the thrust management control system.
The lower unit displays secondary engine parameters, i.e. N2 speed, fuel flow, oil quantity, 
pressure and temperature, and engine vibration. In addition, the status of non-engine systems, 
e.g. flight control surface positions, hydraulic system, APU, etc., can also be displayed together 
with aircraft configuration and maintenance data.
The rows of ‘V’s shown on the upper display unit only appear when secondary information is 
being displayed on the lower unit.

Seven colours are produced by the CRTs and they are used as follows:
White	 	
All scales, normal operating range of pointers, digital read-outs.
Red	
	
Warning messages, maximum operating limit marks on scales, and digital 	
read-outs.
Green	 	
Thrust mode read-out and selected EPR / N1 speed marks or target cursors.
Blue	
	
Testing of system only.
Yellow		
Caution and advisory messages, caution limit marks on scales, digital read-outs.
Magenta	
During in-flight engine starting, and for cross-bleed messages.
Cyan	
	
Names of all parameters being measured (e.g. N1 oil pressure, TAT etc. and 	
status marks or cues).
The displays are selected according to an appropriate display selection mode.

Electronic Instrumentation
Display Modes
EICAS is designed to categorize displays and alerts according to function and usage, and for 
this purpose there are three modes of displaying information: (i) operational, (ii) status and 
(iii) maintenance.
Modes (i) and (ii) are selected by the flight crew on the display select panel, while mode (iii) is 
selected on the maintenance panel which is for the use of ground engineering staff only.
Operational Mode
The operational mode displays the engine operating information and any alerts required to be 
actioned by the crew in flight. Normally only the upper display unit presents information, the 
lower one remains blank and can be selected to display secondary information as and when 
required.
Status Mode
When selected, the status mode displays data to determine the dispatch readiness of an 
aircraft, and is closely associated with details contained in an aircraft’s Minimum Equipment 
List.
The display shows positions of the flight control surfaces in the form of pointers registered 
against vertical scales, selected sub-system parameters, and equipment status messages on the 
lower display unit. Selection is normally done on the ground either as part of preflight checks 
of dispatch items, or prior to shut-down of electrical power to aid the flight crew in making 
entries in the aircraft’s Technical Log.
Maintenance Mode
This mode provides maintenance engineers with information in five different display formats 
to aid them in trouble-shooting and verification testing of the major sub-systems. The displays, 
which are presented on the lower display unit, are not available in flight.

Display Select Panel
This panel, as indicated in Figure 39.3, permits control of EICAS functions and displays and can 
be used both in flight and on the ground. It is normally located on the centre pedestal of an 
aircraft’s flight deck, and its controls are as follows:
•	 Engine Display Switch. This is of the momentary-push type for removing or presenting the 
display of secondary information on the lower display unit.
•	 Status Display Switch. Also of the momentary-push type, this is used to display the status 
mode information referred to earlier, on the lower display unit. The display is known as a 
‘status page’, an example of which is shown in Figure 39.4.
•	 Event Record Switch. This is of the momentary-push type and is used in the air or on the 
ground, to activate the recording of fault data relevant to the environment control system, 
electrical power, hydraulic system, performance and APU. Normally if any malfunction 
occurs in a system, it is recorded automatically (called an ‘auto event’) and stored in a non-
volatile memory of the EICAS computer. The push-switch also enables the flight crew to 
record a suspected malfunction for storage, and this is called a ‘manual event’. The relevant 
data can only be retrieved from memory and displayed when the aircraft is on the ground 
and by operating switches on the maintenance control panel.

Electronic Instrumentation
•	 Computer Select Switch. In the ‘AUTO’ position it selects the left, or primary, computer and 
automatically switches to the other computer in the event of failure. The other positions are 
for the manual selection of left or right computers.
•	 Displays Brightness Control. The inner knob controls the intensity of the displays, and the 
outer knob controls brightness balance between displays.
•	 Thrust Reference Set Switch. Pulling and rotating the inner knob positions the reference 
cursor on the thrust indicator display (either EPR or N1) for the engine(s) selected by the 
outer knob.
•	 Maximum Indicator Reset Switch. If any one of the measured parameters e.g. oil pressure, 
EGT, should exceed normal operating limits, this will be automatically alerted on the display 
units. The purpose of the reset switch is to clear the alerts from the display when the excess 
limits no longer exist.
Alert Messages
The 
system 
continuously 
monitors a large number of 
inputs (typically over 400) 
from engine and airframe 
systems’ sensors and will 
detect any malfunctioning of 
systems.
If this should occur, then 
appropriate 
messages 
are 
generated and displayed on 
the upper display unit in a 
sequence corresponding to 
the level of urgency of action 
to be taken.
Up to 11 messages can 
be displayed, and at the 
following levels:
Level A - Warning requiring immediate corrective action. They are displayed in red. Master 
warning lights are also illuminated, and aural warnings (e.g. fire bell) from a central warning 
system are given.
Level B - Cautions require immediate crew awareness and future crew action. They are displayed 
in amber, and also by message caution lights. An aural tone is also repeated twice.
Level C - Advisories requiring crew awareness. Also displayed in amber. No caution lights or 
aural tones are associated with this level.
The messages appear on the top line at the left of the display screen as shown in Figure 39.5.
Figure 39.5 Alert message levels

              Electronic Instrumentation
39
             
               
 
Electronic Instrumentation
In order to differentiate between a caution and an advisory, the latter is always indented one 
space to the right.
The master warning and caution lights are located adjacent to the display units together with 
a ‘CANCEL’ switch and a ‘RECALL’ switch. Pushing the ‘CANCEL’ switch removes only the 
caution and advisory messages from the display; the warning messages cannot be cancelled. 
The ‘RECALL’ switch is used to bring back the caution and advisory messages into the display. 
At the same time, the word ‘RECALL’ appears at the bottom of the display.
A message is automatically removed from the display when the associated condition no longer 
exists. In this case, messages which appear below the deleted one each move up a line.
When a new fault occurs, its associated message is inserted on the appropriate line of the 
display. This may cause older messages to move down one line. For example, a new caution 
message would cause all existing caution and advisory messages to move down one line.
If there are more messages than can be displayed at one time, the whole list forms what is 
termed a ‘page’, and the lowest message is removed and a page number appears in white on 
the lower right side of the list.
If there is an additional page of messages it can be displayed by pushing the ‘CANCEL’ switch. 
Warning messages are carried over from the previous page.
Display Unit Failure
If the lower display unit 
should fail when secondary 
information is being displayed 
on it, an amber alert message 
appears at the top left of the 
upper display unit, and the 
information is transferred to 
it as shown in Figure 39.6.
The format of this display 
is referred to as ‘compact’, 
and it may be removed by 
pressing the ‘ENGINE’ switch 
on the display select panel. 
Failure of a display unit 
causes the function of the 
panel ‘STATUS’ switch to be 
inhibited so that the status 
page 
format 
cannot 
be 
displayed.

Standby Engine Indicator
This 
indicator 
provides 
primary engine information 
in the event that a total loss 
of EICAS displays occurs.
As shown in Figure 39.7, the 
information relates to N1 
and N2 speeds and EGT and 
the displays are of the LCD 
type. Operating limit values 
are also displayed.
Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM)
The units comprising this system, and as originally developed for the Airbus A310, are shown in 
the functional diagram of Figure 39.8.

Electronic Instrumentation
As far as the processing and display of information are concerned, the ECAM system differs 
significantly from EICAS in that data relates essentially to the primary systems of the aircraft, 
and is displayed in check-list and pictorial or synoptic format.
Engine operating data is displayed by conventional types of instruments as noted in the 
introduction to this chapter. Other differences relate to display locations and selection of 
system operating modes.
Display Units
These units may be mounted side-by-side; the left-hand unit is dedicated to information on the 
status of systems, warnings and corrective action in a sequenced check-list format, while the 
right-hand unit is dedicated to associated information in pictorial or synoptic format.

Display Modes
There are four display modes, three of which are automatically selected and referred to as:
•	 Flight Phase-related
•	 Advisory (mode and status)
•	 Failure-related modes
The fourth mode is manual
•	 Aircraft System Display

The Flight Phase-related Mode
In normal operation the automatic ‘flight phase-related mode’ is used, and in this case the 
displays are appropriate to the current phase of aircraft operation, i.e. preflight, take-off, climb, 
cruise, descent, approach, and after landing.
An example of a preflight phase is shown in Figure 39.9, the left-hand display unit displays an 
advisory memo mode, and the right-hand unit displays a diagram of the aircraft’s fuselage, 
doors, and arming of the escape slides deployment system.
Figure 39.10 Example of the status display
Advisory (Mode and Status)
Status messages, which are also displayed on the left-hand display unit, provide the flight crew 
with an operational summary of the aircraft’s condition, possible downgrading of autoland 
capability, and as far as possible, indications of the aircraft status following all failures except 
those that do not affect the flight. The contents of an example display are shown in Figure 
39.10.

Failure-related Mode
The failure-related mode takes precedence over the other two automatic modes and the 
manual mode.
An example of a display associated with this mode is shown in Figure 39.11.
Figure 39.11 The failure-related mode display
 
In this case, while taxiing out for take-off, the temperature of the brake unit on the rear right 
wheel of the left main landing gear bogie has become excessive.
A diagram of the wheel brake system is immediately displayed on the right-hand display unit, 
and simultaneously the left-hand unit displays corrective action to be taken by the flight crew. 
In addition, an aural warning is sounded, and a light (placarded ‘L/G WHEEL’) on a central 
warning light display panel is illuminated.
As the corrective action is carried out, the instructions on the left-hand display are replaced 
by a message in white confirming the result of the action. The diagram on the right-hand 
display unit is appropriately ‘redrawn’. In the example above, the ‘failure related mode’ 
displaces warning relates to a single system, and by convention such warnings are signified by 
underlining the system title displayed.
In cases where a failure can affect other sub-systems, the title of the sub-system is shown 
‘boxed’, as for instance in the display shown in Figure 39.12.
Warnings and the associated lights are cleared by means of ‘CLEAR’ push-button switches on 
either the ECAM control panel or a warning light display panel.

Figure 39.12 A display showing how a failure affects a sub-system
The Fourth Mode (Manual), the Aircraft System Display Mode
This mode permits the selection of diagrams related to any one of 12 of the aircraft’s systems 
for routine checking, and also the selection of status messages provided no warnings have been 
triggered for display. The selections are made by means of illuminated push-button switches on 
the system control panel.
The ‘ECAM’ Control Panel
The layout of the ‘ECAM’ control panel is shown in Figure 39.13, and all switches, with the 
exception of those for display control, are of the push-button, illuminated caption type.
SGU Selector Switches. These control the respective symbol generator units, and the lights 
are off in normal operation of the system. The ‘FAULT’ caption is illuminated amber if a failure 
is detected by an SGU’s internal self-test circuit. Releasing a switch isolates the corresponding 
SGU, and causes the ‘FAULT’ caption to extinguish, and the ‘OFF’ caption to illuminate white.
Synoptic Display Switches. These permit individual selection of synoptic diagrams corresponding 
to each of 12 systems and illuminate white when pressed. A display is automatically cancelled 
whenever a warning or advisory occurs.

warning is displayed; illuminated white. Pressing the switch also causes the ‘CLR’ switch to 
illuminate. A status message is suppressed if a warning occurs or if the ‘CLR’ switch is pressed.
RCL Switch. The Recall Switch enables previously cleared warning messages to be recalled 
provided the failure conditions which initiated them still exist. Pressing the switch also causes 
the CLR switch light to illuminate. If a failure no longer exists the message ‘NO WARNING 
PRESENT’ is displayed on the left-hand display unit.

Density altitude is defined as “The altitude in the ISA at which the prevailing density 
would be found”.
	
Density altitude may be calculated using the navigation computer or by formula.
	
Example:
	
i.	
pressure altitude - 3000 ft
	
ii.	
ambient temperature - +20°C
	
Navigation Computer Method
	
i.	
in the airspeed window set the pressure altitude of 3000 ft against the 	
	
	
	
temperature of +20°C.
	
ii.	
read the density altitude over the arrow in the density altitude window. 	
	
	
	
(4000 ft)
	
Formula Method
	
i.	
density altitude = pressure altitude × (± ISA deviation × 120)
	
	
therefore: 3 × (+11 × 120)
	
	
= 3960 ft
	
Note:	 If the ambient temperature is lower than ISA then density altitude will be lower 
than pressure altitude and vice versa.

TCAS I	 will issue a Traffic Advisory only.  Manoeuvre of the aircraft is prohibited.
	
TCAS II will issue a Corrective Resolution Advisory instructing the pilot to take corrective 
action in the vertical plane only.
	
TCAS III will issue a Corrective Resolution Advisory instructing the pilot to take corrective 
action in the vertical and/or horizontal planes.
	
Note:	 Do not confuse a “Corrective Resolution Advisory” with a “Preventative 
Resolution Advisory”  which only provides limitations on aircraft manoeuvres as opposed 
to a “Corrective Resolution Advisory” which issues corrective aircraft manoeuvres.

A trihedron is defined as figure having three sides.  Additionally, the IRS establishes 
true north.  Magnetic indications are obtained by the application of variation, which, 
in the case of the Boeing 737-400 is stored in each IRS memory.  The range covered for 
variation is from 73° North to 60° South latitude.

Vertical axis means horizontal plane.  The two are at 90° to each other.  It follows, 
therefore, that heading information only requires one degree of freedom in the

LSS = 38.94 × √temp in K.  
	
Or, on the CRP 5
	
Answer D
46.	
The first thing to remember is that the local speed of sound is dependent on AMBIENT 
temperature not ISA. In this case, applying the temperature deviation to the ISA 
temperature at mean sea level gives an ambient temperature of +5°C.  There are two 
methods of calculating the local speed of sound.  
	
	
The first is to use the formula in question 45 as follows:
	
	
LSS = 38.94 × √278 K
	
	
LSS = 649.26 kt
	
The second method is to use the CRP 5 navigation computer as follows:
	
i	
in the airspeed window set the ambient temperature of +5°C against the 	 	
	
	
mach number index.
	
ii	
against 10 on the inner (CAS/Mach number) scale read off the LSS on the 	 	
	
	
outer (TAS) scale. 650 kt

Answer B

On the CRP 5 first calculate the TAS from the information given.  Don’t forget 
compressibility!  This will give a TAS of 481 kt.  Now in the airspeed window set the 
ambient temperature of -65°C against the Mach number index.  Against the TAS of 481 
on the outer scale read off the Mach number on the inner scale, in this case M 0.855.

During a deceleration the direct reading compass will indicate an apparent turn towards 
the further pole.  In the northern hemisphere it will give an apparent turn towards the 
south whereas in the southern hemisphere it will indicate an apparent turn towards the 
north.  Accelerations are exactly opposite indicating apparent turns towards the nearer 
pole.

Variation is the angular difference between true north and magnetic north
	
Deviation is the angular difference between Magnetic North and Compass North. ‘Dip’ 
is the angle formed between the horizontal component (H or directive force) of the 
earth’s magnetic field and the total magnetic force (intensity) of the earth’s magnetic 
field.
	
An isoclinal is a line joining lines on a chart of equal ‘dip’.  The aclinic line is a line 
indicating zero ‘dip’ and is also referred to as the magnetic equator.
	
Answer C
52.	
In this question the altitude is of no consequence.  Use the same techniques as shown 
in question 46
	
Answer B
53.	
Owing to density error the TAS will increase dramatically in the climb even at a constant 
CAS.  The LSS, being controlled by temperature, will also reduce.  It can be seen from 
the formula that where Mach No. = TAS ÷ LSS an increase in TAS and a decrease in LSS 
must result in a marked increase in Mach No.  A descent would mean a reversal of the 
speed changes seen in the climb.

The apron is 10 ft below the stated aerodrome elevation, so assuming the QFE to be 
for the aerodrome level, an altimeter on the apron should read (–10) ft.  However, the 
instrument is positioned in the aircraft 20 ft above the apron so it should show (–10) + 
20 = +10 ft.  Its actual reading is +40 ft so it is over-reading by 30 ft, an instrument error 
of +30 ft.
