MASS AND BALANCE

OPS 1.605
General

(See Appendix 1 to OPS 1.605)

An operator shall ensure that during any phase of operation, the loading, mass and centre of gravity of the aeroplane
complies with the limitations specified in the approved Aeroplane Flight Manual, or the Operations Manual if more
restrictive.

An operator must establish the mass and the centre of gravity of any aeroplane by actual weighing prior to initial entry
into service and thereafter at intervals of four years if individual aeroplane masses are used and nine years if fleet masses
are used. The accumulated effects of modifications and repairs on the mass and balance must be accounted for and
properly documented. Furthermore, aeroplanes must be reweighed if the effect of modifications on the mass and bal-
ance is not accurately known.

An operator must determine the mass of all operating items and crew members included in the aeroplane dry operat-
ing mass by weighing or by using standard masses. The influence of their position on the aeroplane centre of gravity
must be determined.

An operator must establish the mass of the traffic load, including any ballast, by actual weighing or determine the mass
of the traffic load in accordance with standard passenger and baggage masses as specified in OPS 1.620.

An operator must determine the mass of the fuel load by using the actual density or, if not known, the density calcu-
lated in accordance with a method specified in the Operations Manual.

OPS 1.607

Terminology

Dry operating mass. The total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of operation excluding all usable fuel and
traffic load. This mass includes items such as:

1. crew and crew baggage;
2. catering and removable passenger service equipment; and
3. potable water and lavatory chemicals.

Maximum zero fuel mass. The maximum permissible mass of an aeroplane with no usable fuel. The mass of the fuel
contained in particular tanks must be included in the zero fuel mass when it is explicitly mentioned in the Aeroplane
Flight Manual limitations.

Maximum structural landing mass. The maximum permissible total aeroplane mass upon landing under normal
circumstances.

Maximum structural take off mass. The maximum permissible total aeroplane mass at the start of the take-off run.
Passenger classification.

1. Adults, male and female, are defined as persons of an age of 12 years and above.

2. Children are defined as persons who are of an age of two years and above but who are less than 12 years of age.

OPS 1.610
Loading, mass and balance
An operator shall specify, in the Operations Manual, the principles and methods involved in the loading and in the mass
and balance system that meet the requirements of OPS 1.605. This system must cover all types of intended operations.
OPS 1.615
Mass values for crew
(a)
An operator shall use the following mass values to determine the dry operating mass:
1.
actual masses including any crew baggage; or
2.
standard masses, including hand baggage, of 85 kg for flight crew members and 75 kg for cabin crew members; or
3.
other standard masses acceptable to the Authority.
(b)
An operator must correct the dry operating mass to account for any additional baggage. The position of this additional
baggage must be accounted for when establishing the centre of gravity of the aeroplane.
OPS 1.620
Mass values for passengers and baggage
(a)
An operator shall compute the mass of passengers and checked baggage using either the actual weighed mass of each
person and the actual weighed mass of baggage or the standard mass values specified in Tables 1 to 3 below except
where the number of passenger seats available is less than 10. In such cases passenger mass may be established by use
of a verbal statement by, or on behalf of, each passenger and adding to it a predetermined constant to account for hand
baggage and clothing. The procedure specifying when to select actual or standard masses and the procedure to be fol-
lowed when using verbal statements must be included in the Operations Manual.
(b)
If determining the actual mass by weighing, an operator must ensure that passengers’ personal belongings and hand
baggage are included. Such weighing must be conducted immediately prior to boarding and at an adjacent location.
(c)
If determining the mass of passengers using standard mass values, the standard mass values in Tables 1 and 2 below
must be used. The standard masses include hand baggage and the mass of any infant below two years of age carried by
an adult on one passenger seat. Infants occupying separate passenger seats must be considered as children for the pur-
pose of this subparagraph.
(d)
Mass values for passengers — 20 seats or more
1.
Where the total number of passenger seats available on an aeroplane is 20 or more, the standard masses of male
and female in Table 1 are applicable. As an alternative, in cases where the total number of passenger seats avail-
able is 30 or more, the “all adult” mass values in Table 1 are applicable.
2.
For the purpose of Table 1, holiday charter means a charter flight solely intended as an element of a holiday travel
package. The holiday charter mass values apply provided that not more than 5 % of passenger seats installed in
the aeroplane are used for the non-revenue carriage of certain categories of passengers.

2.
On flights where no hand baggage is carried in the cabin or where hand baggage is accounted for separately, 6 kg
may be deducted from the below male and female masses. Articles such as an overcoat, an umbrella, a small hand-
bag or purse, reading material or a small camera are not considered as hand baggage for the purpose of this
subparagraph.
(f)
Mass values for baggage
1.
Where the total number of passenger seats available on the aeroplane is 20 or more the standard mass values given
in Table 3 are applicable for each piece of checked baggage. For aeroplanes with 19 passenger seats or less, the
actual mass of checked baggage, determined by weighing, must be used.
2.
For the purpose of Table 3:
(i)
Domestic flight means a flight with origin and destination within the borders of one State;
(ii)
Flights within the European region means flights, other than Domestic flights, whose origin and destination
are within the area specified in Appendix 1 to OPS 1.620(f); and
(iii) Intercontinental flight, other than flights within the European region, means a flight with origin and desti-
nation in different continents.

(g)
If an operator wishes to use standard mass values other than those contained in Tables 1 to 3 above, he must advise the
Authority of his reasons and gain its approval in advance. He must also submit for approval a detailed weighing survey
plan and apply the statistical analysis method given in Appendix 1 to OPS 1.620 (g). After verification and approval by
the Authority of the results of the weighing survey, the revised standard mass values are only applicable to that opera-
tor. The revised standard mass values can only be used in circumstances consistent with those under which the survey
was conducted. Where revised standard masses exceed those in Tables 1 to 3, then such higher values must be used.
(h)
On any flight identified as carrying a significant number of passengers whose masses, including hand baggage, are
expected to exceed the standard passenger mass, an operator must determine the actual mass of such passengers by
weighing or by adding an adequate mass increment.
(i)
If standard mass values for checked baggage are used and a significant number of passengers check in baggage that is
expected to exceed the standard baggage mass, an operator must determine the actual mass of such baggage by weigh-
ing or by adding an adequate mass increment.
(j)
An operator shall ensure that a commander is advised when a non-standard method has been used for determining the
mass of the load and that this method is stated in the mass and balance documentation.

Mass and balance documentation
(See Appendix 1 to OPS 1.625)
(a)
An operator shall establish mass and balance documentation prior to each flight specifying the load and its distribu-
tion. The mass and balance documentation must enable the commander to determine that the load and its distribution
is such that the mass and balance limits of the aeroplane are not exceeded. The person preparing the mass and balance
documentation must be named on the document. The person supervising the loading of the aeroplane must confirm
by signature that the load and its distribution are in accordance with the mass and balance documentation. This docu-
ment must be acceptable to the commander, his/her acceptance being indicated by countersignature or equivalent. (See
also OPS 1.1055 (a)12).
(b)
An operator must specify procedures for last minute changes to the load.
(c)
Subject to the approval of the Authority, an operator may use an alternative to the procedures required by para-
graphs (a) and (b) above.

Appendix 1 to OPS 1.605
Mass and Balance — General
(See OPS 1.605)
(a)
Determination of the dry operating mass of an aeroplane
1.
Weighing of an aeroplane
(i)
New aeroplanes are normally weighed at the factory and are eligible to be placed into operation without
reweighing if the mass and balance records have been adjusted for alterations or modifications to the
aeroplane. Aeroplanes transferred from one operator with an approved mass control programme to another
operator with an approved programme need not be weighed prior to use by the receiving operator unless
more than four years have elapsed since the last weighing.
(ii)
The individual mass and centre of gravity (CG) position of each aeroplane shall be re-established periodi-
cally. The maximum interval between two weighings must be defined by the operator and must meet the
requirements of OPS 1.605 (b). In addition, the mass and the CG of each aeroplane shall be re-established
either by:
(A)
Weighing; or
(B)
Calculation, if the operator is able to provide the necessary justification to prove the validity of the
method of calculation chosen, whenever the cumulative changes to the dry operating mass exceed
± 0,5 % of the maximum landing mass or the cumulative change in CG position exceeds 0,5 % of the
mean aerodynamic chord.
2.
Fleet mass and CG position
(i)
For a fleet or group of aeroplanes of the same model and configuration, an average dry operating mass and
CG position may be used as the fleet mass and CG position, provided that the dry operating masses and CG
positions of the individual aeroplanes meet the tolerances specified in subparagraph (ii) below. Furthermore,
the criteria specified in subparagraphs (iii), (iv) and (a)3 below are applicable.
(ii)
Tolerances
(A)
If the dry operating mass of any aeroplane weighed, or the calculated dry operating mass of any
aeroplane of a fleet, varies by more than ± 0,5 % of the maximum structural landing mass from the
established dry operating fleet mass or the CG position varies by more than ± 0,5 % of the mean aero-
dynamic chord from the fleet CG, that aeroplane shall be omitted from that fleet. Separate fleets may be
established, each with differing fleet mean masses.
(B)
In cases where the aeroplane mass is within the dry operating fleet mass tolerance but its CG position
falls outsides the permitted fleet tolerance, the aeroplane may still be operated under the applicable dry
operating fleet mass but with an individual CG position.
(C)
If an individual aeroplane has, when compared with other aeroplanes of the fleet, a physical, accurately
accountable difference (e.g. galley or seat configuration), that causes exceedance of the fleet tolerances,
this aeroplane may be maintained in the fleet provided that appropriate corrections are applied to the
mass and/or CG position for that aeroplane.
(D) Aeroplanes for which no mean aerodynamic chord has been published must be operated with their indi-
vidual mass and CG position values or must be subjected to a special study and approval.
(iii) Use of fleet values
(A)
After the weighing of an aeroplane, or if any change occurs in the aeroplane equipment or configura-
tion, the operator must verify that this aeroplane falls within the tolerances specified in subpara-
graph 2.(ii) above.
(B)
Aeroplanes which have not been weighed since the last fleet mass evaluation can still be kept in a fleet
operated with fleet values, provided that the individual values are revised by computation and stay
within the tolerances defined in subparagraph 2(ii) above. If these individual values no longer fall within
the permitted tolerances, the operator must either determine new fleet values fulfilling the conditions
of subparagraphs 2(i) and 2(ii) above, or operate the aeroplanes not falling within the limits with their
individual values.

(C)
To add an aeroplane to a fleet operated with fleet values, the operator must verify by weighing or com-
putation that its actual values fall within the tolerances specified in subparagraph 2(ii) above.
(iv) To comply with subparagraph 2(i) above, the fleet values must be updated at least at the end of each fleet
mass evaluation.
3.
Number of aeroplanes to be weighed to obtain fleet values
(i)
If “n” is the number of aeroplanes in the fleet using fleet values, the operator must at least weigh, in the period
between two fleet mass evaluations, a certain number of aeroplanes defined in the Table below:
Number of aeroplanes in the fleet
Minimum number of weighings
2 or 3
N
4 to 9
(n + 3)/2
10 or more
(n + 51)/10
(ii)
In choosing the aeroplanes to be weighed, aeroplanes in the fleet which have not been weighed for the long-
est time should be selected.
(iii) The interval between two fleet mass evaluations must not exceed 48 months.
4.
Weighing procedure
(i)
The weighing must be accomplished either by the manufacturer or by an approved maintenance organisation.
(ii)
Normal precautions must be taken consistent with good practices such as:
(A)
checking for completeness of the aeroplane and equipment;
(B)
determining that fluids are properly accounted for;
(C)
ensuring that the aeroplane is clean; and
(D) ensuring that weighing is accomplished in an enclosed building.
(iii) Any equipment used for weighing must be properly calibrated, zeroed, and used in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Each scale must be calibrated either by the manufacturer, by a civil department
of weights and measures or by an appropriately authorised organisation within two years or within a time
period defined by the manufacturer of the weighing equipment, whichever is less. The equipment must
enable the mass of the aeroplane to be established accurately.
(b)
Special standard masses for the traffic load. In addition to standard masses for passengers and checked baggage, an
operator can submit for approval to the Authority standard masses for other load items.
(c)
Aeroplane loading
1.
An operator must ensure that the loading of its aeroplanes is performed under the supervision of qualified
personnel.
2.
An operator must ensure that the loading of the freight is consistent with the data used for the calculation of the
aeroplane mass and balance.
3.
An operator must comply with additional structural limits such as the floor strength limitations, the maximum
load per running metre, the maximum mass per cargo compartment, and/or the maximum seating limits.

Centre of gravity limits
1.
Operational CG envelope. Unless seat allocation is applied and the effects of the number of passengers per seat
row, of cargo in individual cargo compartments and of fuel in individual tanks is accounted for accurately in the
balance calculation, operational margins must be applied to the certificated centre of gravity envelope. In deter-
mining the CG margins, possible deviations from the assumed load distribution must be considered. If free seat-
ing is applied, the operator must introduce procedures to ensure corrective action by flight or cabin crew if
extreme longitudinal seat selection occurs. The CG margins and associated operational procedures, including
assumptions with regard to passenger seating, must be acceptable to the Authority.
2.
In-flight centre of gravity. Further to subparagraph (d)1 above, the operator must show that the procedures fully
account for the extreme variation in CG travel during flight caused by passenger/crew movement and fuel
consumption/transfer.

Appendix 1 to OPS 1.620 (g)
Procedure for establishing revised standard mass values for passengers and baggage
(a)
Passengers
1.
Weight sampling method. The average mass of passengers and their hand baggage must be determined by weigh-
ing, taking random samples. The selection of random samples must by nature and extent be representative of the
passenger volume, considering the type of operation, the frequency of flights on various routes, in/outbound
flights, applicable season and seat capacity of the aeroplane.
2.
Sample size. The survey plan must cover the weighing of at least the greatest of:
(i)
A number of passengers calculated from a pilot sample, using normal statistical procedures and based on a
relative confidence range (accuracy) of 1 % for all adult and 2 % for separate male and female average masses;
and
(ii)
For aeroplanes:
(A)
with a passenger seating capacity of 40 or more, a total of 2 000 passengers; or
(B)
with a passenger seating capacity of less than 40, a total number of 50 x (the passenger seating capacity).
3.
Passenger masses. Passenger masses must include the mass of the passengers’ belongings which are carried when
entering the aeroplane. When taking random samples of passenger masses, infants shall be weighted together with
the accompanying adult (See also OPS 1.620 (c) (d) and (e)).
4.
Weighing location. The location for the weighing of passengers shall be selected as close as possible to the
aeroplane, at a point where a change in the passenger mass by disposing of or by acquiring more personal belong-
ings is unlikely to occur before the passengers board the aeroplane.
5.
Weighing machine. The weighing machine to be used for passenger weighing shall have a capacity of at least
150 kg. The mass shall be displayed at minimum graduations of 500 g. The weighing machine must be accurate
to within 0,5 % or 200 g whichever is the greater.
6.
Recording of mass values. For each flight included in the survey the mass of the passengers, the corresponding
passenger category (i.e. male/female/children) and the flight number must be recorded.
(b)
Checked baggage. The statistical procedure for determining revised standard baggage mass values based on average bag-
gage masses of the minimum required sample size is basically the same as for passengers and as specified in subpara-
graph (a)1.. For baggage, the relative confidence range (accuracy) amounts to 1 %. A minimum of 2 000 pieces of
checked baggage must be weighed.
(c)
Determination of revised standard mass values for passengers and checked baggage
1.
To ensure that, in preference to the use of actual masses determined by weighing, the use of revised standard mass
values for passengers and checked baggage does not adversely affect operational safety, a statistical analysis must
be carried out. Such an analysis will generate average mass values for passengers and baggage as well as other data.
2.
On aeroplanes with 20 or more passenger seats, these averages apply as revised standard male and female mass
values.
3.
On smaller aeroplanes, the following increments must be added to the average passenger mass to obtain the
revised standard mass values:
Number of passenger seats
Required mass increment
1-5 inclusive
16 kg
6-9 inclusive
8 kg
10-19 inclusive
4 kg

Alternatively, all adult revised standard (average) mass values may be applied on aeroplanes with 30 or more pas-
senger seats. Revised standard (average) checked baggage mass values are applicable to aeroplanes with 20 or more
passenger seats.
4.
Operators have the option to submit a detailed survey plan to the Authority for approval and subsequently a devia-
tion from the revised standard mass value provided this deviating value is determined by use of the procedure
explained in this Appendix. Such deviations must be reviewed at intervals not exceeding five years.
5.
All adult revised standard mass values must be based on a male/female ratio of 80/20 in respect of all flights except
holiday charters which are 50/50. If an operator wishes to obtain approval for use of a different ratio on specific
routes or flights then data must be submitted to the Authority showing that the alternative male/female ratio is
conservative and covers at least 84 % of the actual male/female ratios on a sample of at least 100 representative
flights.
6.
The average mass values found are rounded to the nearest whole number in kg. Checked baggage mass values are
rounded to the nearest 0,5 kg figure, as appropriate.

Mass and Balance Documentation
(a)
Mass and balance documentation
1.
Contents
(i)
The mass and balance documentation must contain the following information:
(A)
the aeroplane registration and type;
(B)
the flight identification number and date;
(C)
the identity of the commander;
(D) the identity of the person who prepared the document;
(E)
the dry operating mass and the corresponding CG of the aeroplane;
(F)
the mass of the fuel at take-off and the mass of trip fuel;
(G)
the mass of consumables other than fuel;
(H)
the components of the load including passengers, baggage, freight and ballast;
(I)
the take-off mass, landing mass and zero fuel mass;
(J)
the load distribution;
(K)
the applicable aeroplane CG positions; and
(L)
the limiting mass and CG values.
(ii)
Subject to the approval of the Authority, an operator may omit some of this Data from the mass and balance
documentation.
2.
Last minute change. If any last minute change occurs after the completion of the mass and balance documenta-
tion, this must be brought to the attention of the commander and the last minute change must be entered on the
mass and balance documentation. The maximum allowed change in the number of passengers or hold load accept-
able as a last minute change must be specified in the Operations Manual. If this number is exceeded, new mass
and balance documentation must be prepared.
(b)
Computerised systems. Where mass and balance documentation is generated by a computerised mass and balance sys-
tem, the operator must verify the integrity of the output data. He must establish a system to check that amendments of
his input data are incorporated properly in the system and that the system is operating correctly on a continuous basis
by verifying the output data at intervals not exceeding 6 months.
(c)
Onboard mass and balance systems. An operator must obtain the approval of the Authority if he wishes to use an
onboard mass and balance computer system as a primary source for despatch.
(d)
Datalink. When mass and balance documentation is sent to aeroplanes via datalink, a copy of the final mass and bal-
ance documentation as accepted by the commander must be available on the ground.

Stowage of baggage and cargo
Procedures established by an operator to ensure that hand baggage and cargo is adequately and securely stowed must take
account of the following:
1.
each item carried in a cabin must be stowed only in a location that is capable of restraining it;
2.
mass limitations placarded on or adjacent to stowages must not be exceeded;
3.
underseat stowages must not be used unless the seat is equipped with a restraint bar and the baggage is of such size
that it may adequately be restrained by this equipment;
4.
items must not be stowed in toilets or against bulkheads that are incapable of restraining articles against movement
forwards, sideways or upwards and unless the bulkheads carry a placard specifying the greatest mass that may be placed
there;
5.
baggage and cargo placed in lockers must not be of such size that they prevent latched doors from being closed securely;
6.
baggage and cargo must not be placed where it can impede access to emergency equipment; and
7.
checks must be made before take-off, before landing, and whenever the fasten seat belts signs are illuminated or it is
otherwise so ordered to ensure that baggage is stowed where it cannot impede evacuation from the aircraft or cause
injury by falling (or other movement) as may be appropriate to the phase of flight.

Introduction
EU-OPS 1 Subpart J requires that during any phase of operation the loading, mass and centre 
of gravity of the aeroplane complies with the limitations specified in the approved Aeroplane 
Flight Manual, or the Operations Manual if more restrictive.
It is the responsibility of the commander of the aircraft to satisfy himself that this requirement 
is met.
Limitations
Limitations on mass are set to ensure adequate margins of strength  and performance, and 
limitations on CG position are set to ensure adequate stability and control of the aircraft in 
flight.
Effects of Overloading
The four forces of lift, weight, thrust and drag acting on an aircraft all induce stress into 
the airframe structural members in the form of tension, compression, torsion, bending etc. 
The structure may, at the same time of absorbing these stresses, be subject to extremes of 
temperature ranging from minus 56°C to plus 40°C. 
The stress and temperature factors gradually fatigue the structure as time progresses. Fatigue, 
in this sense of the word, is a permanent loss of the physical properties (strength, durability, 
hardness etc) of the materials comprising the structure.  Fatigue will, if left undetected or 
unattended, eventually cause the structure to fail altogether – possibly with catastrophic and/
or fatal consequences. 
Fatigue is cumulative and non-reversible and the higher the fatigue level the greater the risk of 
premature structural failure. Structure that is inadvertently subject to additional fatigue may 
fail earlier than predicted or expected.
The aircraft designer must, for each individual part of the structure, determine the frequency of 
application of the stress producing loads and, together with the temperature factors, determine 
the types of stress involved. Based on this data, a Design Limit Load (DLL) is calculated for each 
member and for the complete structure. The DLL is the maximum load that can be applied to 
the structure repeatedly during normal operations without inducing excessive fatigue and the 
pilot must never deliberately exceed this value. 
As a safeguard, the aviation authorities impose a factor of safety of 50% to the DLL to produce 
a Design Ultimate Load (DUL). The DUL is the minimum load the structure must be able to 
absorb in an emergency (heavier than normal landing or flight in exceptional gusty wind 
conditions) without collapsing.  In order to keep weight to a minimum the aircraft’s structure 
is manufactured from materials that are just capable of absorbing the DUL.
Structure subject to loads in excess of the DUL is likely to suffer some permanent damage and 
may even collapse altogether.
An aeroplane’s principal function is to lift mass into the air, transport that mass through the air 
and then land it back on the ground without damage. Clearly, the greater the mass that has to 
be lifted the greater will be the loading on each member of the aircraft structure. Overloading 
the aeroplane will induce additional fatigue. For the purposes of cost efficiency it is important 
to maximize the mass transported by the aeroplane but without overloading it.

Definitions and Calculations
The manufacturer of the structural parts of the aircraft is responsible for determining the 
stresses the aeroplane will be subject to both on the ground and in the air, and to impose 
suitable mass limits so that the integrity of the structure is guaranteed throughout the aircraft’s 
working life. The limits include: the maximum taxi mass (MTM); the maximum zero fuel mass 
(MZFM); the maximum structural take-off mass (MSTOM) and the maximum structural landing 
mass (MSLM). These values must never be exceeded in normal operation. 
It is necessary at this point to note that, in Mass & Balance terms, mass and weight are 
synonymous (used to express the same thing).
Increasing age, inappropriate use, hostile environmental and climatic conditions are all factors 
that induce stress and fatigue into the aircraft’s structure. However, weight is the principal 
stress factor for inducing fatigue into aircraft structure. 
Weight also has pronounced effects on the aircraft’s performance, handling and aerodynamic 
properties. With an increase in weight:
•	 Performance is reduced:
•	 Take-off and landing distances will increase. V1 decision speed, VR rotation speed, V2  take-
off safety speed, and the stopping distance will all increase. The climb gradient, rate of 
climb and ceiling height will all reduce. 
•	 The rate of descent will increase.
•	 The stalling speed will increase and maximum speed will reduce.
•	 The safety margins and the effective speed range between low and high speed buffet 
will reduce.
•	 Drag and fuel consumption will increase.
•	 Range and endurance will reduce.
•	 Wing root stresses will increase. 
•	 Manoeuvrability will reduce. The aircraft will become less responsive to control inputs and 
more difficult to fly.
•	 Wing root stresses and undercarriage loads will increase as will tyre and brake wear.
Effects of Out of Limit CG Position
The centre of gravity (CG) is:
•	 the point that the total weight of the aircraft is said to act through
•	 the point of balance
•	 that part of the aircraft that follows the flight path
•	 the point that the aircraft manoeuvres about in the air
•	 the point that the three axes of the aircraft pass through.

                    Definitions and Calculations

Definitions and Calculations
The position of the CG determines how stable or how manoeuvrable the aircraft will be. 
Starting at the mid position of the fuselage, a CG moving towards the nose of the aircraft 
will progressively increase the stability and, at the same time, progressively reduce the 
manoeuvrability. Similarly, a CG moving aft towards the tail of the aircraft will increase the 
manoeuvrability and decrease the stability. Too much stability increases the flying control stick 
forces and the work load on the pilot trying to overcome them. Too much manoeuvrability 
makes the aircraft unstable and difficult to control.  
With regard to aeroplanes, the CG is not fixed. It moves in flight as a result of fuel burn, flap 
positions, and crew and passenger movements. It is the aircraft operator’s responsibility to 
ensure that the CG movement is retained within the limits imposed by the manufacturer.
The manufacturer sets down CG range of movement limits to ensure that the average pilot is 
able to control the aircraft through all stages of flight safely, with normal piloting effort, free 
of fatigue.
The following paragraphs indicate the effects that might occur if the CG is caused to exceed 
the limits. Students are advised to learn them well – they are frequently asked in the exams.
A CG outside the forward limit:
•	 Drag increases, consequently fuel consumption, range and endurance decrease. In order 
to keep the nose of the aircraft from pitching downwards the tailplane must produce a 
balancing down load – a bit like a see-saw. The resulting elevator deflection increases drag, 
which in turn increases fuel consumption and reduces range and endurance.
 
•	 The longitudinal stability is increased, resulting in higher control column forces during 
manoeuvres with a corresponding increase in physical effort required to overcome them, 
leading to increased pilot fatigue.
•	 The increase in tail down force is equivalent to an increase in weight; consequently the stall 
speed will increase. An increase in stall speed has a significant effect on other performance 
aspects of the aircraft: take-off and landing speeds will increase, the available speed range 
will reduce and the safety margin between low and high speed buffet will narrow.
•	 The ability to pitch the aircraft’s nose up or down will decrease because of the increased 
stability.
•	 Take-off speeds V1, VR, VMU will increase. On the ground the aeroplane rotates about the 
main wheels and uses the elevators to raise the nose for take-off. The CG, being ahead of 
the main wheels, produces a down force that the elevators, together with the speed of the 
airflow passing over them, must overcome. The more forward the CG the greater the down 
force and, for a particular elevator deflection, the greater the speed of the airflow required. 
The aircraft must accelerate for longer to produce the airspeed required.

Definitions and Calculations
A CG outside the aft limit:
•	 Longitudinal stability is reduced and, if the CG is too far aft, the aircraft will become very 
unstable (like a bucking bronco). Stick forces in pitch will be light, leading to the possibility 
of over stressing the aircraft by applying excessive ‘g’.
•	 Recovering from a spin may be more difficult as a flat spin is more likely to develop.
•	 Range and endurance will probably decrease due to the extra drag caused by the extreme 
manoeuvres.
•	 Glide angle may be more difficult to sustain because of the tendency for the aircraft to pitch 
up.
Movement of CG in Flight
Figure 2.1 and the table below compare in a simplistic arrow format, the effects on aircraft 
performance of having the CG on the forward CG limit to the performance that would be 
achieved with the CG on the aft limit. The table goes on to show how an increase in mass 
affects performance. Be advised that the M&B examinations contain a number of performance 
related ‘theory type’ questions (they seldom include performance type calculations).

EU-OPS 1 states that the CG position must remain within the range limits at all times, whether 
in the air, taking off, landing or loading and unloading on the ground. Changes to the load 
distribution that may occur during any stage of the intended flight i.e. fuel burn, passenger 
or crew movements, will affect the CG position and must be properly accounted for prior to 
take-off.
Definitions
The following definitions are to clarify and enhance the definitions that are found in CAP 696, 
pages 3 and 4.
Centre of Gravity
The point through which the force of gravity is said to act on a mass (in aircraft terms, the point 
on the aircraft through which the total mass is said to act in a vertically downward manner). 
The centre of gravity is also the point of balance and as such it affects the stability of the 
aircraft both on the ground and in the air.
Centre of Gravity Limits 
The CG is not a fixed point; it has a range of movement between a maximum forward position 
and a maximum rearward position which is set by the aircraft manufacturer and cannot be 
exceeded. The CG must be on or within the limit range at all times. The limits are given in the 
flight manual and are defined relative to the datum. They may also be given as a percentage of 
the mean chord of the wing. (The wing mean chord was called the Standard Mean Chord but 
is now known as the Mean Aerodynamic Chord or more simply, the MAC.)
Datum
A point along the longitudinal axis (centre line) of the aeroplane (or its extension) designated 
by the manufacturer as the zero or reference point from which all balance arms (distances) 
begin. By taking  moments about the datum the CG position of the aircraft can be determined. 
For the purposes of this phase of study the lateral displacement of the CG from the longitudinal 
axis is assumed to be zero.

Definitions and Calculations
Balance Arm 
The distance from the aircraft’s datum to the CG position or centroid of a body or mass. For 
example, the centroid of a square or rectangle is the exact centre of the square or rectangle 
and, in such cases, the balance arm is the distance from the datum to the exact centre of the 
square or rectangle. Unfortunately, cargo bays are seldom exact squares or rectangles and so 
the centroid (the point the total weight acts through) is given by the manufacturer.
For the purposes of  calculations, all balance arms ahead of (in front of) the datum are given a 
negative (-) prefix and those behind (aft of) the datum are given a positive (+) prefix.
Figure 2.2 Positive and negative balance arms
Inexperienced students tend to get their positive and negative signs mixed up and thus fail 
to arrive at the correct answer. In arithmetical calculations, a positive value multiplied by a 
negative value results in a negative answer but two positive or two negative values multiplied 
together always produce a positive answer.
Loading Index   
The result of multiplying a force by a mass often produces an answer of such magnitude that 
it is too bulky and time consuming to utilize. A Loading Index is simply a moment divided by 
a constant and has the effect of reducing the magnitude of the moment to one that is much 
easier to use.

In the example shown, the moment for the DOM is 31 150 574 but the Dry Operating Index 
(DOI) is only 31. Later, as you progress through the course, you will be using a DOI and another 
index called the Fuel Index to complete a Load and Trim Sheet.
Basic Empty Mass
See CAP 696 for the definition of the BEM. All light aircraft use the BEM and its CG position as 
the foundation from which to calculate all relevant masses and CG positions. See Figure 2.8 as 
an example. 
Dry Operating Mass
See CAP 696 for the definition of the DOM. All large aircraft use the DOM as the foundation 
from which to calculate all relevant masses and CG positions. The Load and Trim Sheet cannot 
be completed until the DOM and its CG position are known.
Operating Mass
See CAP 696 for the definition of the OM. The OM is also used when completing the Load and 
Trim Sheet.
Traffic Load
See CAP 696 for the definition of the traffic load. Originally known as the ‘payload’, the traffic 
load is the revenue generating load that pays the salaries and hopefully produces a profit for 
the operator.  The definitions of and calculations of the traffic load constitute a sizeable part 
of the  exam. There are six ways to define the traffic load and students need to be familiar with 
all of them.
Useful Load
The useful load is the sum of the traffic load and the take-off fuel load.
The Maximum Zero Fuel Mass
See CAP 696 for the definition of the MZFM. The maximum stress in the wing roots occurs when 
the wing fuel tanks are empty. To ensure that the wings do not fold up permanently above the 
aircraft as the fuel is consumed a maximum zero fuel mass is imposed on the structure by the 
manufacturer.
Maximum Structural  Taxi Mass
Every litre of fuel on board is essential for safe operations and aircraft are allowed to carry 
additional fuel for engine starting and ground taxiing purposes. This additional fuel, which is 
limited to a maximum value, is allowed to take the weight of the aircraft above the MSTOM 
during ground operations only. The additional fuel should be consumed by the time the aircraft 
is ready to commence the take-off run. The MSTM may also be referred to as the Ramp Mass 
or the Block Mass.
See CAP 696 for definitions of MSTOM, PLTOM, MSLM and PLLM

Weighing of Aircraft
Aircraft are weighed on specialized weighing equipment in a draught free hangar at periods 
specified in EU-OPS 1, Subpart J. On each and every occasion of weighing a WEIGHING 
SCHEDULE is compiled by the person in charge of the weighing procedure. The schedule lists 
the BASIC EQUIPMENT installed on the aeroplane and records the mass values displayed on 
the weighing apparatus, together with the calculated moments. It culminates in a statement 
defining the Basic Empty Mass and Centre of Gravity position of the aeroplane and is signed by 
the person in charge of the weighing procedure. The schedule is then retained in the aircraft’s 
TECHNICAL LOG until the next weigh. At each subsequent weigh the list of basic equipment on 
the previous weighing schedule is used to define the condition the aircraft must be prepared to 
in order that an accurate comparison of weights can be determined. The weighing procedure is 
a time and manpower consuming process as all non-basic items of equipment such as passenger 
seats and passenger service equipment (food and duty free trolleys etc) do not form part of 
the basic equipment. They must be removed prior to the weigh and be refitted afterwards.

Figure 2.5 A weighing schedule (simplified for training purposes)
Any changes to the basic equipment that occur in the period between each weigh are recorded 
in the aeroplane’s technical log and, as they vary from the equipment listed on the previous 
weighing schedule, they have to be accounted for separately at the next weigh.

Weighing Equipment.  There are a number of ways of weighing aircraft accurately but, 
depending on the overall size and weight of the aeroplane, weigh-bridge scales, hydrostatic 
units or electronic equipment are the principal methods in use.
•	 Weigh-bridge scales. This equipment is generally used for light aeroplanes and consists of 
a separate electronic weighing platform for the nose or tail wheel and each main wheel 
assembly of the aircraft. The mass at each platform is recorded directly on the balance arm 
or electronic display and the masses are added together to give the BEM.
•	 Hydrostatic units. This equipment is used for larger, heavier aircraft and utilizes the principle 
embodied in Pascal’s Law i.e. that the pressure of a liquid in a closed container is proportional 
to the load applied. The units are fitted at each jacking point and are interposed between 
the lifting jack and the jacking points on the aircraft. Again, the mass values on each unit 
are added together to give the BEM
•	 Electronic equipment. This equipment is also used on the larger, heavier aircraft and 
consists of strain gauges fitted at each jacking point and utilizes the principle that electrical 
resistance varies with the load applied. The readings are added together to give the BEM.
The other masses and CG positions applicable to the aircraft e.g. DOM, OM, TOM etc, can be 
determined by simple addition and multiplication once the Basic Empty Mass and CG position 
of the aeroplane have been established. 
The mass of the fuel load can be calculated arithmetically providing the quantity and specific 
gravity of the fuel are known.
Actual mass of passengers and baggage can be used or the standard masses given in the tables 
in EU-OPS 1 Subpart J, can be used as an expedient alternative.
It is not normally possible to apply standard mass tables to freight because it varies so much 
from flight to flight. Therefore, in general, all freight has to be weighed. It is possible, in certain 
circumstances, for an operator to apply to the CAA for permission to produce and use standard 
mass tables for freight, but this exception is not part of the EU examinations syllabus.
Light aircraft use the BEM and CG position as the foundation from which the other mass and 
CG requirements are determined. Larger aircraft have additional mass and CG limits to comply 
with and they utilize a Load and Trim Sheet, incorporating the DOM as a basis, to simplify and 
standardize the process. 
The operator of fleet aeroplanes of the same model and configuration may use an average 
DOM and CG position for the whole fleet providing the requirements of EU-OPS 1, Subpart J 
are met. 
Minimum Equipment List
An aeroplane manufacturer must produce a Minimum Equipment List (MEL) for each of their 
aircraft type. The MEL defines, amongst other things, the minimum level of serviceable usable 
equipment the aircraft must have prior to flight. As an example, an aeroplane with three 
engines would be permitted to fly, in some circumstances, with only two engines operable. 
The MEL serviceable equipment requirements vary according to the climatic and environmental 
conditions that exist in various theatres of the world. An aircraft operator will extract from 
the MEL those limitations applicable to his/her aircraft and will enter them into the Aircraft 
Operating Schedule.

Definitions and Calculations
In addition, the MEL lists the basic equipment requirements for each aircraft and also lists the 
optional specialist equipment that can be fitted for a particular role. It is therefore very useful 
when determining the BEM and DOM of an aeroplane.
Calculation of Fuel Mass
It is the commander of the aeroplane’s responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient fuel on 
board the aeroplane to safely complete the intended flight and to land with not less than a 
specified level of fuel remaining in the tanks – irrespective of delays and diversions.
The safe operating fuel requirements defined above are satisfied by filling the tanks as shown 
in Figure 2.6. The Fuel Tank Contents:
2% of the fuel tank is required for venting
Start and Taxi Fuel
A specified amount of fuel which is additional
to the Regulated Take-off Mass to allow the aircraft 
to start up and transit to the runway without 
consuming any of the take-off fuel.
Trip Fuel
The amount of fuel that is required to complete the planned
flight form Airfield A to Airfield B
Contingency Fuel
The amount of fuel required to enable the aircraft to
circumnavigate bad weather between Airfield A and Airfield B
and/or to remain in the hold at Airfield B until a landing slot is 
available. Usually 3% to 5% of the trip fuel.  
Alternate Fuel
The calculated amount of fuel required to divert from Airfield A 
(or Airfield B) to an alternate airfield C due to an emergency 
Final Reserve
A reserve of fuel over and above the fuel requirements
defined so far to cater for any other unpredicted emergency
Captain’s Discretion
Fuel taken up for economic or other operational reasons.
VENTS
Ramp or Block 
Fuel as it is 
sometimes 
called is the
sum of all the 
fuel in the 
tanks
Figure 2.6 Fuel requirement regulations
Taking off at airfield ‘A’ and landing at airfield ‘B’ is classed as a trip or sector. 
Having determined the mass of the trip fuel, the commander of the aeroplane may need to 
convert this mass value into a quantity value for the benefit of the refuel operator. Fuel is 
sometimes dispensed in gallons or litres.
In order to convert quantity (gallons or litres) into mass (pounds or kilograms) and vice versa, 
the density or the specific gravity (SG) of the fuel must be known. Normally, the delivery note

                    Definitions and Calculations

Definitions and Calculations
provided by the refuel operator provides the SG of the fuel taken up. However, if, for some 
unforeseen reason, the actual fuel density is not known a standard fuel density, as specified 
by the operator in the Operations Manual, must be used. Density is defined as mass per unit 
volume and relative density or specific gravity (SG), is simply a comparison between the mass 
of a certain volume of a substance and the mass of an equal volume of pure water.
The following chart is a handy method of converting volume to mass. Students are advised to 
remember the chart and how to use it as it will not be provided in the exams.

Calculation of the Basic Empty Mass and CG Position
In order to determine the Basic Empty Mass and CG position of an aeroplane the aircraft 
must first be prepared to the basic empty mass standard which entails removing all special 
equipment and usable fuel and oils.
The aircraft is placed such that its main wheels and the nose (or tail) wheels rest on the 
individual weighing scales which have been calibrated and zeroed. The readings on the scales 
are recorded as shown:

      4500 lb
The Basic Empty Mass of the aeroplane is 4500 lb and the CG is 24.4 inches behind the 
datum (as shown by the positive sign).
The Basic Empty Mass is found by adding together the readings on the scales. 
To find the CG position we need to take moments about the datum. In  Mass & Balance terms 
a moment is a mass multiplied by a balance arm. Remember that arms (distances) forward of 
the datum are negative and a negative multiplied by a positive gives a negative value (see the 
nose wheel line above).

Definitions and Calculations
Notice in the example that each of the three entries above the line consist of a mass multiplied 
by an arm to give a moment. The entry below the line consists of a mass and a moment but no 
balance arm. The missing arm is the CG position.
To find the CG position the total moment is divided by the total mass. If the CG value is negative 
then the CG is in front of the datum otherwise it is behind the datum.
It is important to distinguish between mass and weight. Mass is the amount of matter in a body 
in kilograms and weight is the force that the matter exerts on the earth’s surface, in Newtons.
If the readings on the weighing scales are given in Newtons but the question asks for the 
BEM and CG position then it is necessary to convert the weight into mass to arrive at the right 
answer.

Calculation of the Loaded Mass and CG Position for Light Aircraft
The loaded mass and CG is determined by tabulating the mass, arm and moment of the 
passengers, baggage, cargo, fuel and oil, adding the masses to the BEM to find the TOM and 
adding the moments to find the Total Moment. The CG is found by dividing the Total Moment 
by the Total Mass: CG = Total Moment/Total Mass.
The LM is found by subtracting the fuel and oil consumed during the flight from the TOM. The 
CG position of the LM is found by taking moments and dividing the LM Moment by the LM. 
For simplicity and standardization the mass, arms and moment data is tabulated on a Load 
Manifest or Load Sheet. (See Figure 2.9 for a complete example).
In the following pages we will concentrate on calculating the take-off mass and CG position 
for the single-engine piston aircraft SEP1 using these values.

in graphical form (CAP 696, section 2, SEP1 page 4, Figure 2.5) against which the calculated

Moments are often large numbers containing more than six digits and this can be an extra 
source of difficulty. In the SEP example shown, the moments have been divided by one hundred 
to reduce the number of digits and make them more manageable. Take care if you use this 
procedure because you must remember at the end of any calculations to multiply the final 
answers by one hundred to arrive at the correct total moment.
The fuel load may be given as a quantity (Imperial or American gallons) rather than a mass and 
you must convert it to mass before you can complete the load sheet (see Figure 2.7). Fuel mass 
and distribution may also be given in tabular form as shown in the example above, where the 
fuel mass and moment have been taken from the SEP1 fuel chart, Figure 2.3, of the CAP 696 
Mass and Balance Manual.
The take-off and landing CG positions can now be determined by using the following procedure:
Take-off CG
•	 Sum (add up) the vertical ‘MASS’ column to determine in turn, the ZFM, the Ramp Mass 
and the TOM.
(ZFM = 3295 lb; Ramp Mass = 3655 lb and TOM = Ramp Mass – Start/Taxi fuel = 3655–13
= 3642 lb)
•	 Check the Operating Manual to ensure that limiting masses of MZFM, MSTM and Regulated 
TOM have not been exceeded.
•	 Sum the vertical ‘MOMENTS’ column to determine the total moment for ZFM, Ramp Mass 
moment and TOM.
(ZFM moment = 284 286 lb in; Ramp Mass moment = 284 286 + 27 000 = 311 286 lb in; TOM 
moment 311 286 – 1000 = 310 286 lb in). 
Note, the figures in the table are shown in the abbreviated form e.g. 310 286/100 = 3102.9 
which is less accurate but easier to cope with.
•	 Divide the moment of the TOM by the TOM to determine the CG position at take-off. 
(TOM CG position = 310 290 ÷ 3642 = 85.2 inches aft of the datum).
•	 Check the Operating Manual to ensure that the CG is within limits at both the ZFM and TOM 
situations. If this is the case then the CG will remain within the limits throughout the flight 
and should not go out of limits during the journey provided the fuel is used in the correct 
sequence.
Landing CG
•	 Determine the moment of the fuel used in flight (the trip fuel) by multiplying its mass by 
the fuel arm. In light aircraft the fuel arm will usually be the same as the one used previously 
to calculate the take-off CG position. However, caution is required because in some large 
aircraft the balance arm of the fuel may change with the quantity of fuel consumed.
THE FUEL CONSUMED WILL GIVE A NEGATIVE MASS IN THE MASS COLUMN AND THIS 
WILL CHANGE THE MOMENT SIGN E.G. IF THE FUEL ARM IS POSITIVE THE FUEL MOMENT 
WILL BECOME NEGATIVE.
--- Page 50 ---
Definitions and Calculations

2
Definitions and Calculations
•	 In the ‘MASS’ column, subtract the fuel used during the flight from the TOM to determine 
the Landing Mass.
(Landing Mass = 3642 – 240 = 3402 lb).
•	 Check the Operating Manual to ensure that the Regulated Landing Mass has not been 
exceeded.
•	 In the ‘MOMENTS’ column, determine the sign of the fuel moment and add or subtract it as 
appropriate, to the TOM moment to determine the landing moment.
	
(Landing Moment = 310 286 – [240 × 75] = 310 286 – 18 000 = 292 286 lb in [or 2922.9 lb in 
in the abbreviated form]).
•	 If the CG is within limits at the ZFM then, for large aircraft, it is not normally necessary to 
calculate the landing CG position because, as stated previously, the CG will be within limits 
throughout the flight. However, for light aircraft it is usual to determine the landing CG 
position and this is simply achieved by dividing the landing moment by the landing mass. 
(Landing CG position = 292 286 ÷ 3402 = 85.92 inches aft of the datum because it has a 
positive sign).
The CG can also be found by using the Centre of Gravity Envelope for the SEP1 shown below. 
This is a graphical representation of the mass and centre of gravity limits. The vertical axis is the 
mass in pounds, the horizontal axis is the CG position in inches aft of the datum and the slanted 
lines represent the moment/100.

CG Position as a Percentage of Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)
In the previous examples the CG position and CG limits are given as distances from a datum. 
An alternative method is to state the CG position and its limits as a percentage of the Mean 
Aerodynamic Chord (MAC). This is common practice with many swept wing airliners and it is so 
with the twin jet we shall be studying next.
The mean aerodynamic  chord  is one  particular chord on the wing calculated from the 
aerodynamic characteristics of that particular wing. Because the CG affects many aerodynamic 
considerations, particularly stability, it is useful to know the CG position in  relation to the 
aerodynamic forces.
The length of the MAC is constant and it is at a  fixed distance from the datum. The CG is

the MAC is given in percentage forms - CG position of 25% MAC would mean that the CG was

Answers can be found on page 92.
Repositioning of the Centre of Gravity
If the centre of gravity is found to be out of limits for any part of the flight, the aircraft must 
not take off until the load has been adjusted so as to bring the centre of gravity into limits.
This may be achieved in one of two ways:
•	 By repositioning mass which is already on  board the aircraft. This will usually be baggage 
or passengers.
•	 By adding or removing mass. Mass put on to the aircraft purely for the purpose of positioning 
or correcting the CG position is known as ballast.
The minimum mass to be moved, or the minimum amount of mass to be loaded or off-loaded, 
will be that which just brings the centre of gravity on to the nearest limit. It may be preferable 
of course to bring the CG further inside the limits. When the amount of mass adjustment has 
been calculated, it must be ascertained that this makes the aircraft safe for both take-off and 
landing.

Repositioning of the Centre of Gravity by Repositioning Mass
Figure 2.12 Repositioning mass
In Figure 2.12 the centre of gravity has been found to be out of limits at a distance ‘a’ inches aft 
of the datum. The forward CG limit is ‘b’ inches aft of the datum. To bring the CG into limits, 
some baggage (m) will be moved from compartment A to compartment B.
If a mass of m lb is moved from A to B the change of moment will be
	
	
	
m × d
That is, the change of moment is equal to the mass moved (m) multiplied by the distance 
through which it moves (d).
If the total mass of the aircraft is M, with the CG at ‘a’ inches aft of the datum, the total 
moment around the datum is M  ×  a.
It is required to move the CG to ‘b’ inches aft of the datum. The new total moment will then 
be M × b.
The change in moment required is therefore M × b - M × a  = M(b - a).
And M (b - a)  = m × d
b - a is equal to the change to the CG position ‘cc’. 
And so m × d  = M × cc
That is, the mass to move multiplied by the distance it moves is equal to the total aircraft mass 
multiplied by the distance the CG moves through.

Repositioning of the Centre of Gravity by Adding or Subtracting Mass
The position of the CG can also be adjusted by adding or subtracting mass. Mass added simply 
to reposition the CG is called ballast.
Figure 2.15 Adding or Removing Mass
To calculate the minimum amount of ballast required:
In Figure 2.15 the CG has been found to be out of limits at a distance ‘X’ in aft of the datum. 
The forward CG limit is at a distance ‘Y’ in aft of the datum. To bring the CG into limits, ballast 
will be put in compartment B, a distance ‘Z’ in aft of the datum.
If the total mass of the aircraft is M lb, the total moment will be M × X lb in.
If ballast of m lb is placed in compartment B in order to move the CG to its fwd limit, the 
total mass will increase to M + m and the new total moment will be   (M + m) × Y.  Assuming 
equilibrium to be maintained, the original total moment plus the moment of the added mass 
must equal the new total moment.
Algebraically using the above notation then:
(M + m) × Y	
=	
(M × X) + (m × Z)
New Total Moment	
=	
Old Total Moment + Cargo Moment
The same formula can be used for removing mass by changing the plus sign to a minus. So, for 
any calculation involving adding or subtracting mass remember the formula:
New Total Moment	
=	
Old total moment plus or minus the Cargo Moment
Note that when calculating a change in CG position using the New Moment =  Old Moment ± 
Change in Moment the distances (X, Y and Z) are always measured from the datum itself.
We will do an example calculation together.

CG  = 149 480
 1890  =  79.1 in aft of datum
The CG is out of limits by 4.9 in too far forward. It will be brought into limits by putting ballast 
in the baggage compartment. The minimum ballast would be that required to bring the CG to 
84 in.
Using our formula:
	
	
	
NTM	
=     OTM  +  CM
	
(1890 + m) × 84	
=	
(1890 × 79.1) + (m  × 140)
	
158  760 + 84m		
=	
149 499 + 140m
	
158 760 - 149 499

Therefore mass of ballast required  = 165.4 lb
It would be necessary to check that loading the ballast did not cause the total mass to exceed 
the Maximum Take-off Mass and as before, that the aircraft was in limits for landing.
Although this may appear to be a long winded method it will always provide the correct 
answer, remember you may be asked to calculate a mass to add or remove, a change to the CG 
or the position to put ballast.

aft of the datum and the fuel SG is 0.72?
Answers shown on page 92.
Graphical Presentation
The aircraft mass and CG position are frequently calculated using one of a number of graphical 
methods. These notes give several examples of the graphs that may be used: see CAP 696 and 
this book page 45 and page 75. There are two things in common on any of the graphs 
used:
•	 The CG must be within the envelope or on the line of the envelope. 
•	 The mass of the aeroplane is always shown on the vertical scale.
The example of a mass and CG envelope for the SEP1, shown in CAP 696 Sect 2, SEP1 page 4, 
is unusual in that it uses both mass and moments on the vertical scale.
The horizontal scale may use the CG position (inches, metres or centimetres), the moment of 
the CG (kg inches, kg metres or kg centimetres) or the percentage of the CG along the mean 
aerodynamic chord.  The MEP1 envelope, shown in CAP 696, Section 3 - MEP1 page 3, is an 
example of using CG position and the MRJT envelope shown in CAP 696, Section 4 - MRJT, 
page 9, is an example of the use of the MAC percentage.

Cargo Handling
Figure 2.16 Cargo handling
Cargo Compartments
Compartments in the lower deck accommodate baggage and cargo. The compartments feature 
fire resistant sidewalls, ceilings and walkways. Cargo compartments are usually pressurized 
and heated and typically have fire detection and protection equipment. Cargo compartments 
usually have a maximum floor loading (kg/m2) and maximum running load value (kg/m).
Containerized Cargo
Baggage and cargo can be loaded into standard size containers designed to fit and lock into the 
cargo compartment. The containers have an individual maximum mass limit and an individual 
floor loading limit (mass per unit area).
Palletized Cargo
Cargo can also be loaded onto standard size pallets and restrained with cargo nets or strops. 
Typically the forward area of the forward cargo compartment is configured to take palletized 
freight.
Bulk Cargo
Bulk cargo can be loosely loaded in the area at the aft of the rear cargo compartment and 
separated from the containers by a restraining net attached to the floor, ceiling and sidewalls.
Cargo Handling Systems
The forward and aft cargo compartments typically have separate cargo power drive systems to 
move containers and cargo pallets.
The power drive system is operated by a control panel at the door area of each cargo 
compartment and is capable of loading and unloading fully loaded containers or pallets in wet 
or dry conditions. A typical panel is shown in Figure 2.17.

Power drive units (PDU) are mounted in the floor and are controlled by the control joystick 
to move  containers laterally and longitudinally in the doorway area and longitudinally in the 
compartment forward and aft of the doorway.

Guides, rollers, stops, locks and tie down fittings are included in the appropriate places to 
provide adequate ‘G’ restraint for the containers in flight.
Floor Loading
The floors of the passenger cabin and the freight areas of the aircraft are limited in the load 
that they can carry. Placing excessive loads on the structure may not only cause visible panel 
creasing and local indentations but is likely to significantly accelerate structural fatigue. Fatigue 
is cumulative and can lead to major structural collapse of the structure with little or no warning.
The floor loading is defined both by linear loading and by area loading intensity.

Definitions and Calculations
Linear / Running Loads
The linear (or running) loading limitation (lb per linear foot or kg per linear inch) protects the 
aircraft underfloor frames from excessive loads. Depending on the units used, it is the total 
load permitted in any one inch or one foot length of the aircraft (irrespective of load width).
Figure 2.18 Linear Loading
Calculating the linear load distribution
As can be seen at Figure 2.18, example (a), the linear load on the floor members is 500 kg divided 
by the 10 inch length i.e. 50 kg/inch; which is greater than the 45 kg/in allowed. However, the 
way in which an item of load is located in an aircraft can create an acceptable situation out of 
an unacceptable one.
In example (b), by simply rotating the load through 90° the linear load on the floor members 
becomes 500 kg/20 inches i.e. 25 kg/in; which is well within the limit. It can be seen that the 
least linear loading occurs when the longest length is placed at right angles to the floor beams.
Area Load Limitations
Area load limitations (kg/sq metre or lb/sq ft) protect the aircraft floor panels. The two 
permissible intensities of pressure are “Uniformly Distributed” (UD) and “Concentrated” loads.
UD Loads
The general floor loading limitations for cargo are referred to as UD loads and are given as 
allowable lb/sq ft. Providing that a load (or series of loads) is within the allowable UD limitations 
for the floor area on which it rests, the loading is subject only to :
•	 not exceeding the linear load limitations.
•	 the individual and accumulated compartment load limitations.
Concentrated Loads
Load intensities which exceed the UD load intensities, “concentrated loads”, can be carried 
providing approved load spreaders are used to distribute the load over sufficient area to ensure 
that loading limits are not exceeded.
Load Spreaders
When concentrated loads or items of load with hard or sharp areas are carried on an aircraft, 
some form of floor protection is essential. The normal practice is to employ standard load 
spreaders of 2 inch thick timber.

(spreading the load across the underfloor frames).

in detail. Notes on particular items follow.
MRJT 1 Figure  4.1 and 4.2 Body Station
Though it would be possible to locate components and parts of the airframe structure by 
actually measuring their distance from the CG datum, it would be difficult and impractical on 
anything other than a very small aircraft. Instead, aircraft are divided about their three axes by a 
system of station numbers, water lines and buttock lines. The system of structural identification 
is not part of this subject except to say that in the past, station numbers were used as balance 
arms about the datum for first-of-kind aircraft. However, new variants of original series aircraft 
are often made by inserting additional lengths of fuselage and consequently, the distances of 
components and structure from the original datum undergo a change. The station numbers 
could all be re-numbered to enable them to retain their use as balance arms but it is often more 
beneficial to retain the original station numbers as they are. This means that on some variant 
aircraft they can no longer be used as balance arms for CG purposes and in order to find out 
how far a particular station is from the datum a conversion chart is required.
An example of such a chart is given in CAP 696, Section 4, MRJT1, Page 1.
Figure 4.1 of the CAP 696 Mass and Balance Manual shows a fuselage side view which includes 
the balance arms about the datum. The table at Figure 4.2 shows how the station numbers for 
the aircraft can be converted into balance arms and vice versa. An examination of the table 
will show that this aircraft is a variant of a previous series aircraft in that two fuselage sections 
500A to 500G and 727A to 727G have been inserted. This is the reason the balance arms and

the station numbers are not coincidental and why the conversion chart is required. Notice from 
the chart that the centre section of the airframe (stations 540 to 727) which is the same as the 
original aircraft, has retained its original station numbers and they are coincidental with the 
balance arms.
Here are two examples of how to use the chart:
•	 Convert body station 500E into a balance arm.
Body station 500E = 348 + 110 = Balance arm 458 inches.
•	 Convert balance arm 809 inches into a station number.
Balance arm 809 – 82 = Station number 727
Further examination of the chart shows that balance arm 809 is actually station number 727D.
Now try these:
1.	
What is the station number at the nose of the aircraft?
2.	
What is the station number 1365 inches from the datum?
3.	
What is the distance of station 500 from the datum?
4.	
What is the distance of station 727C from the datum?

MRJT 1 Figure  4.3 and 4.4 Flap Position
The movement of the flaps on a large aircraft may have a considerable effect on the CG position. 
Table 4.3 shows the moment change to the aircraft when the flaps are extended or retracted, 
for example retracting the flaps from 30° to 0° would cause a total moment change of minus 
15 000 kg in. Conversely extension of the flaps from 0° to 40° would cause a total moment 
change of plus 16 000 kg in.
The stabilizer setting for take-off is extracted from the graph at Figure 4.4. The purpose of this 
is to allow the stabilizer trim to be set to allow the elevator sufficient authority to enable the 
aircraft to be rotated during the take-off run and controlled during the first stages of flight. 
The position of the CG will determine the stabilizer setting for take-off.

STABILIZER TRIM UNITS
Figure 2.19 Stabilizer trim setting
Example 1
What is the stabilizer trim setting if the CG is 15% MAC and the flaps are moved from the 5° to 
the 15° position?
From the graph, if the CG is 15% MAC and the flap setting is 5° then the stabilizer trim setting 
will be 4.25 units nose up.
If the CG was the same 15% MAC with a flap setting of 15° then the stabilizer trim setting 
would be 3.5 units nose-up.
Example 2
If, as a result of the traffic and fuel load, the CG moved from 15% MAC to 24% MAC, what 
would be the change in stabilizer trim?
From the graph, the stabilizer trim for 5 degrees take-off flap would change from 4.25 trim 
units at 15% MAC to 3 trim units at 24% MAC.
Note: To enable the pilot to correctly set the stabilizer trim for take-off there will be a trim 
indicator on the instrument panel or as an integrated part of an electronic display unit.
MRJT1 Figure 4.9 Cargo Compartment Limitation (CAP 696, MRJT1, Page 5)
These tables detail the cargo compartment limitations which must be considered when items 
of cargo are loaded to ensure that the limitations are not exceeded.
Running Load
The running load is the fore/aft linear load. For example a box having dimensions of 3 feet by 
3 feet by 3 feet and weighing 100 kg would have a running load of 100 ÷ 3 = 33.3 kg per foot 
which would be equal to 33.3 ÷ 12 = 2.78 kg per inch. Be very careful to use the correct units
--- Page 69 ---

63
                    Definitions and Calculations
2
Definitions and Calculations
(Do not forget that there is a conversion chart on page 4 of the data sheets)
However, if a box having the same weight was 3 ft × 2 ft × 3 ft then it could be positioned so 
that the 2 ft side was running fore/aft in which case the running load would be:
100 ÷ 2 ÷ 12 =  4.16 kg per inch
The cargo may have to be orientated correctly to prevent exceeding the running load 
limitations.
Area Load
The first box would have a load intensity (mass per unit area) of 100 ÷ 9 = 11.1 kg per square 
foot as the area it would be standing on would be 3 × 3 = 9 square feet.
The second box, however, could be place on its side measuring 2 ft × 3 ft = 6 square feet area, 
it would therefore have a load intensity of 100 ÷ 6 = 16.66 kg per sq ft.
The cargo may have to be orientated correctly to prevent exceeding the distribution load 
limitations.
Calculation of the Loaded Mass and CG Position for Large Aircraft
The TOM and ZFM and their respective CG positions are determined by the method used for 
light aircraft except the DOM is used as the starting point as opposed to the BEM.
The fuel reserves and the traffic load compilation are more complex for a large aeroplane than 
for a light one, and so a Load and Trim Sheet is used to coordinate the data and simplify the 
procedure. 
Many large aircraft operators do not bother to calculate the landing mass and CG position on 
the Trim Sheet but calculate the ZFM and CG position instead. The reason being that should a 
large aircraft need to divert to another airfield its actual landing mass could be many tonnes 
more, or less, than estimated value and its CG position could vary considerably from the 
projected value.  Assuming that both TOM and the ZFM and their respective CG positions are 
within limits prior to take-off they will remain in limits throughout the flight (see Figure 2.23 
and Figure 2.25 for examples of a completed Load Sheet and Trim Sheet respectively).
Compiling a Document (Load Sheet)
A load sheet in its simplest form is a list showing the BEM/DOM and CG position.  Added in 
tabular form are the elements of the traffic load and fuel by their individual masses, arms and 
moments. From this list the take-off mass and CG position can be calculated.
A load sheet is individual to each type of aircraft and must be compiled before each flight.
A load sheet is required by EU-OPS 1 Subpart J to contain some mandatory information:
•	 The aeroplane registration and type
•	 The flight number
•	 The identity of the commander
•	 The identity of the person who prepared the document.
•	 The dry operating mass and CG position.
•	 The mass of take-off fuel and trip fuel.

•	 The limiting mass and CG values.
Calculations (MRJT1)
Calculating the Underload Using the Formulae
The captain of the aircraft needs to know if he is able to accommodate any additional last 
minute changes to the load e.g. VIPs, emergency evacuation etc. Before the captain can 
allow any last minute additions to the load he must know if he has any spare load capacity 
or underload as it is referred to. Unfortunately, the underload is not simply the difference 
between the regulated take-off mass and the actual take-off mass; the MZFM and the Traffic 
Load have to be considered.
Clearly, if the aircraft is already at its MZFM it has no underload. Even if it is below the MZFM, 
any underload may have already been consumed by extra fuel uptake.
Any last minute load additions that are allowed will increase the size of the traffic load. The 
traffic load that can be carried is the lowest value of the Structural Traffic Load, the Take-off 
Traffic Load and the Landing Traffic Load.
The allowed traffic load is the lowest of the following (you are required to know these 
formulae):
•	 Structural Limited Traffic Load	
    =	
MZFM – DOM
•	 Take-off Limited Traffic Load	
    =	
RTOM – DOM – Take-off fuel
•	 Landing Limited Traffic Load	
    =	
RLM – DOM – Fuel remaining

Definitions and Calculations
In the case of the MRJT1 aircraft, if the DOM = 34 300 kg, the take-off fuel = 12 000 kg and the 
fuel remaining at landing  =  4000 kg:
Structural Limited Traffic Load	
=    51 300 – 34 300 = 17 000 kg
Take-off Limited Traffic Load	 	
=    62 800 – 34 300 – 12 000  = 16 500 kg
Landing Limited Traffic Load	 	
=    54 900 – 34 300 – 4000 = 16 600 kg
The allowed traffic load  is thus 16 500 kg. But if the actual traffic load was only 16 000 kg there 
would be a 500 kg underload.
You are required to know how to determine the allowable traffic load using the formulae 
above.
Fuel Load Definitions
Students need to have a basic knowledge of the fuel load definitions before they attempt 
traffic load calculations.
•	 Start and Taxi Fuel:
The mass of fuel used in starting and operating the APU and the main engines and in 
taxiing to the runway threshold for take-off. It is assumed that at the point of releasing the 
brakes for take-off the aircraft is at or below the regulated take-off mass  for  the conditions 
prevailing. In operations where fuel is critical the start and taxi fuel must not be less than 
the amount expected to be consumed during the start and taxi procedures.
•	 Trip Fuel:
This is the mass of fuel required to complete the take-off run, the climb, the cruise, the 
descent, the expected arrival procedures, and the approach and landing at the designated 
airport.
•	 Contingency Fuel:
Fuel carried in addition to the trip fuel for unforeseen eventualities such as avoiding bad 
weather or having an extended hold duration at the destination airport. The contingency 
fuel in  calculations is usually given as a percentage of the trip fuel e.g. if the trip fuel is 1000 
kg mass the contingency fuel at 5% of the trip fuel would be 50 kg. Do not forget that the 
contingency fuel is part of the landing mass if it is not actually used during the trip.
•	 Alternate (Diversion) Fuel:
That mass of fuel required to carry out a missed approach at the destination airfield, and 
the subsequent climb out, transit to, expected arrival procedures, approach, descent and 
landing at an alternate airfield.
•	 Final Reserve Fuel:
The minimum fuel that should be in the tanks on landing. Essentially it is a final reserve 
for unplanned eventualities and should allow a piston engine aircraft to fly for a further 
45 minutes or a jet engine aeroplane to fly for a further 30 minutes at a given height and 
holding speed.
•	 Additional Fuel:
Only required if the sum of the trip, contingency, alternate and final reserve fuels are 
insufficient to cover the requirements of AMC OPS 1.255 (Instrument landings and power 
unit failures which are not required for calculations).
--- Page 72 ---
Definitions and Calculations

Definitions and Calculations
The take-off fuel for calculations is simply the sum of the above, excluding the start and taxi 
fuel.
Note that the fuel state requirements vary with the intended flight plan and they are not always 
required.
The landing fuel mass is the actual amount of fuel remaining in the tanks at touchdown. In 
a trip where no eventualities have occurred it will include the contingency, alternate, final 
reserve and additional fuel masses if they were included in the flight plan.
Calculating the underload using the Load and Trim Sheet
The Load and Trim Sheet used for the MRJT1 automatically calculates the underload but does 
it using a slightly different method than that shown above. Instead of determining the lowest 
traffic load the Load and Trim Sheet first determines the allowable Take-off Mass. It then 
calculates the allowable Traffic Load by deducting the Operating Mass from the allowable 
Take-off Mass. Finally, it calculates the underload by deducting the actual Traffic Load from the 
allowable Traffic Load.
The allowable Take-off Mass is the lowest of:
•	 MZFM + Take-off Fuel
•	 Regulated Take-off Mass
•	 Regulated Landing Mass + Fuel used in flight
For example, in the case of the MRJT1, the MZFM is given as 51 300 kg, the MSTOM is 
62 800 kg and the MSLM is 54 900 kg. Let us assume that there are no performance limits so 
that the Regulated Take-off and Landing masses are equal to the Structural Limited Take-off 
Mass and the Structural Limited Landing Mass respectively. Let us also assume that the DOM 
is 34 000 kg, that the actual traffic load is 12 400 kg, the take-off fuel load is 16 000 kg and 
8000 kg of fuel was used in flight.
Allowable Take-off Mass is the lowest of:
•	 MZFM + Take-off Fuel
51 300 kg + 16 000 kg	
=	
67 300 kg
•	 Regulated Take-off Mass
62 800 kg	
	
	
=	
62 800 kg
•	 Regulated Landing Mass + Estimated fuel consumption
54 900 kg  + 8000 kg	
=	
62 900 kg
The maximum allowable Traffic Load for the conditions prevailing can now be determined by 
subtracting the Operating Mass from the Regulated Take-off Mass i.e.:
Maximum Traffic Load	
=	
Regulated Take-off Mass – Operating Mass
	
	
	
	
=	
62 800 kg – (34  000 kg + 16 000 kg)
	
	
	
	
=          	12 800 kg
The underload can now be determined by subtracting the actual traffic load from the maximum 
allowable traffic load.

=          	400 kg
Fortunately, the MRJT1 Load and Trim Sheet makes easy work of the above calculations and 
you are advised to practise using the Load and Trim Sheet.
Example Calculations
Calculations may be carried out using the Loading Manifest (data sheet Figure 4.10) and CG 
limits envelope (Figure 4.11) or the Load and Trim Sheet (Figure 4.12) in CAP 696, Chapter 4, 
MRJT1.
We will do a sample calculation using both methods.
Using the following values complete the Loading Manifest Figure 2.20 and check the limiting 
values with the CG envelope.

FUEL	 	
15 000 kg at take-off
	
	
260 kg start and taxi
	
	
10 000 kg trip fuel
Use CAP 696, MRJT1, data sheets where required to find the balance arm for the MAC and vice 
versa. The moment/1000 is calculated from the arm/1000. The balance arm is calculated by 
dividing the total moment by the total weight. The fuel balance arm and quantity in each tank 
are also found from the data sheets. 
Note: the centre fuel tank content is used before the wing tank fuel content and the centre tank 
includes 24 kg of unusable fuel.
As a start, if the DOM CG position is 15% MAC, then that is 15% of 134.5 inches (CAP 696, 
MRJT1, Chapter 4, Page 2) or 20.175 inches. That makes the CG balance arm 20.175 + 625.6 
= 645.8 inches aft of the datum The fuel load balance arm can be extracted from Figure 4.5 
and Figure 4.6 of the loading manual, for example the maximum contents of tanks one and 
two is 9084 kg with a balance arm of 650.7. Fill in the following blank sheet using the above 
information then check the aircraft has not exceeded any of the limits in the CG envelope.

See if your answer agrees with mine. (I have estimated changes to the fuel tank CG position 
and accounted for the unusable fuel in the centre tank. However, the fuel CG position will be 
fixed and there will be no unusable fuel to account for in the EASA exams)

Load and Trim Sheet (MRJT1)
Figure 2.22 shows a combined Load and Trim Sheet for a modern twin jet airliner designated 
EASA - Medium Range Twin Jet (MRJT1). See CAP 696, MRJT1, Page 9, of the Loading Manual. 
(Students may be required to complete a part of the Load and Trim Sheet during the EASA 
exams).
The left hand side of the page (part A) is the loading document which itemizes the mass and 
mass distribution within the aeroplane i.e. dry operating mass, traffic load and fuel load. The 
right hand side (part B) indicates how each mass in turn subsequently affects the position of 
the CG in relation to the mean aerodynamic chord. The ZFM and the TOM must be within the 
relevant area of the graph envelope on completion of the mass calculations otherwise the 
aircraft is unsafe to fly.
Part A (loading summary) should be completed as follows:
Section 1  is used to establish the limiting take-off mass, maximum allowable traffic load and 
underload before last minute changes (LMC)
Section 2  shows the distribution of the traffic load using the following abbreviations.

Section 3  summarizes the loading and is used to cross-check that limiting values have not been 
exceeded.
Part B  is the distribution and trim portion. The lower part is the CG envelope graph, the 
vertical scale of which is given in terms of mass and the horizontal axis scale in terms of MAC.

Using data from the loading summary enter the Dry Operating Index (DOI) for the 
DOM.
2.	
Move the index vertically downwards into the centre of the first row of horizontal 
boxes. Note that each box within the row has a pitch which represents either a defined 
mass or a number of persons. There is also an arrow indicating the direction in which 
the pitch is to be read.
3.	
Move the index horizontally in the direction of the arrow to a pitch value corresponding 
to the value in the Mass/No box immediately to the left of the row.

Repeat operations 1 to 3 above for each subsequent row of boxes down to and including 
row 0g. After completing the index calculation for row 0g, drop a line vertically down 
until it bisects a mass on the vertical scale of the envelope corresponding to the Zero 
Fuel Mass. The point of bisection must occur within the MZFM envelope.
5.	
Go to the horizontal row of boxes marked ‘Fuel index’ and add the take-off fuel index.
6.	
After completing the fuel index calculation drop a line vertically down from it until it 
bisects a mass on the vertical scale of the envelope corresponding to the Take-off Mass. 
The point of bisection must occur within the TOM envelope.

Providing the ZFM and the TOM are within the envelope as described above, the aircraft 
is safe for the intended flight - including any permitted diversions.

Section 1 of the load sheet is completed first in order to find the three potential take-off masses 
(a, b and c). The value at (a) is the take-off mass you would achieve if you loaded the aeroplane 
to the MZFM and then added your intended fuel load. The value at (b) is the regulated take-
off mass for the take-off airfield conditions as existing and the value at (c) is the take-off mass 
you would achieve if you were to land at the regulated landing mass and then added back the 
mass of the trip fuel. The lowest of (a), (b) and (c) is the limiting take-off mass for traffic load 
calculations. 
The maximum allowable traffic load for the trip can be determined by subtracting the 
operating mass from the limiting take-off mass. Subsequently, any underload can be calculated 
by subtracting the actual traffic load from the allowable traffic load (14 000 - 13 370 = 630). The 
underload sets the limiting mass for any last minute changes (LMC). Sections 2 and 3 of the 
load sheet detail the mass and distribution of the traffic load and give actual values of take-off 
and landing masses.

In part B the graph is entered at the top by drawing a vertical line from the DOM index of 45 
into the row for cargo compartment 1. This row is split into sections by heavy lines representing 
1000 kg, each section is split again into 10, each line representing 100 kg. The arrow in the box 
represents the direction to move to adjust for that mass.
Follow the same procedure for each cargo compartment or seating compartment until you 
have adjusted for all of the traffic load. Before adjusting for the fuel load draw the line down 
to intersect with the zero fuel mass to identify the ZFM CG position. Then adjust for the fuel 
index taken from the data sheets, page 30, and draw the line vertically down to identify the 
take-off CG position.

Max running load	
=  
Load
Min Length 	
          	                              	
        
	
	
Therefore min length = 500 kg / 350 kg /m =  1.428 m
	
	
Thus, anything shorter than 1.428 m will exceed the maximum running load.
	
	
Max distribution load	 =  
Load
Min Area      	
	
	
Therefore min area = 500 kg/300 kg/m2 = 1.66 m2
	
	
Thus, any area less than 1.66 m2 will exceed the max floor intensity.
	
	
Using the above, only boxes 3 and 4 meet the distribution load requirements 
but the load must be placed with its longest length parallel to the longitudinal 
axis to meet the running load requirement.

Ramp Fuel mass 	
=	
20 100 l × 0.78		
	
= 15 678 kg
	
	
	
Take-off fuel	
	
=	
15 678 – 250 {start/taxi}	
= 15 428 kg
	
	
Fuel remaining		
=	
15 428 – 9250	 	
	
= 6178 kg
	
	
From CAP 696, MZFM	=	
51 300 kg
	
	
1.	
MZFM –DOM  	
=	
51 300 – 34 930	
	
= 16 370 kg
	
2.	
MSTOM is lower than PLTOM thus
	
	
MSTOM – DOM – TO Fuel	
 = 62 800 – 34 930 – 15 428    	 = 12 442 kg
	
3.	
PLLM is lower than SLLM, thus
	
	
PLLM - DOM  - Fuel Remaining = 54 200 – 34 930 – 6178      	 = 13 092 kg
	
	
Allowable TL	 	
	
 =  lowest of 1, 2 or 3 above	
= 12 442 kg
8.       	 b.	
The Maximum Structural Landing Mass is set by the manufacturer to meet 		
	
	
with the Design Limit Loads (DLL) of the structure. If exceeded, the structure 	
	
	
will be subject to excessive fatigue and could even be permanently damaged.
9.       	 c.	
1.	
Stick forces at rotation will increase [weight is fwd of wheel rotation].
	
	
2.	
Range will decrease but endurance will increase [ both will decrease].
	
	
3.	
Gliding range will reduce [gliding range is not affected by weight].
	
	
4.	
Stalling speed will increase [stalling speed increases with weight].
10.	
a.	
Wrong. You will still believe it to be the speed you calculated because you are 	
	
	
unaware of the error.
	
b.	
Correct. VMU will be later (the extra mass will prolong the point of minimum 	
	
	
lift-off).
	
c.	
Wrong. You will pull the stick back to rotate at the speed you originally 	
	
	
	
calculated.
	
d.	
Wrong. They will all occur later.
11	
d.	
the CG is behind the rear limit (review the Principles of Flight notes on Static 	
	
	
Margin. If the CG were positioned on the neutral point and the aeroplane was 	
	
	
disturbed in pitch by a gust of wind, it would retain the new attitude because 	
	
	
the moments about the CG would all equal one another.)
12.	
b.	
Wrong. The manufacturer sets the limits not the position.
	
c.	
Correct. Within the range set by the manufacturer.
13.	
c.	
Stabiliizer trim applies a balancing moment (about the CG) but does not move 
the CG position.
14.	
d.	
Oceanic means there are no obstacles to consider. Though we have an 	
	
	
	
unlimited  runway the high elevation of the airfield will result in a low air 	 	
	
	
density. Also, the time, being at the hottest part of the day, will 	
	
	
	
	
further reduce the air 	density. The reduced density will seriously reduce 	
	
	
	
the engine performance limits. Weight would be limited in order to achieve a 	
	
	
suitable climb gradient.

a.	
1.3VS         	
=	
180 kt, therefore VS	
= 180
1.3 	 	
=	
138.46 kt
                                                             	
	
     
	
	
New VS 	
=	
Old VS  ×  √(New weight/Old Weight)
	
   	
 	
	
=	
138.46  ×  √ (320 000/285 000)	
=	
146.7 kt
	
	
Assuming the aircraft continues to fly at 1.3VS its new speed will be:
	
	
	
	
146.7 × 1.3 = 190.7 kt
	
	
Naturally, drag will increase and range (nautical miles per kg of fuel) will 	
	
	
	
decrease).

The datum does not have to be between the nose and the tail. (The datum 
can be anywhere in front of, on or behind the aircraft so long as it is on the 	
longitudinal axis of the aeroplane).
17.     	 c.	
TOM = DOM + Traffic Load + Fuel Load. 
	
	
But, Traffic Load + Fuel Load = Useful Load. 	 	
	
	
Thus, TOM = DOM + Useful Load, Rearrange formula, UL = TOM – DOM

2, 3, 4 and 5 only.
	
	
In this example the performance limitation is not stated and could be anything 
from a runway length restriction, a sloping runway, an obstruction limitation 
and/or altitude/temperature limitations. The aeroplane might sustain a burst 
tyre, brake fade, and/or brake fire as a result of heavy braking. Tyre temperatures 
might exceed limits and delay the take-off time even if they do not burst. The 
climb slope for obstacle clearance during a go-around might be reduced. As the 
landing is below the MSLM, the structure itself should not suffer direct damage 
providing the aeroplane comes to a stop without hitting anything.

The pilot calculates the amount of fuel to jettison to reduce the mass to a safe 
level at or below the RLM. (Before jettisoning the fuel the pilot should attempt 
to declare an emergency if time permits and advise Air Traffic Control of his 
intensions).

23.       	a.	
When attempting this sort of question the golden rule is to work out the 
fuel states first. Once the fuel states are known you can simply use the three 
formulae to determine the answer.
	
	
TOF	
= 9700 + 1200 + 1400 = 12 300
	
	
FR	
= 1200 + 1400 = 2600
	
	
DOM	 = 34 900
	
	
MZFM	 = 53 000
	
	
RTOM	 = 62 800
	
	
RLM	
= 54 900
	
	
Formulae
	
	
	
1. 	
MZFM – DOM		
=	
53 000 - 34 900		
	
= 18 100
	
	
2. 	
RTOM – DOM – TOF	 =	
62 800 - 34 900 - 12 300	
= 15 600
	
	
3. 	
RLM – DOM – FR	
=	
54 900 - 34 900 - 2600	  	
= 17 480
	
	
Allowable TL	 	
=   Lowest of 1, 2, 3 Above	
=   15 600 kg
	
	
Actual TL	
	
=   PAX  +  Baggage	
	
=   (130 × 84) + (130 × 14)
	
	
Actual TL	
	
=   12 740 kg
	
	
Difference Between Allowed TL and Actual TL  	
=   Underload 
	
	
	
Cargo That Can Be Taken	
	
	
	
=   Underload
	
	
Cargo	   =     15 600  –  12 740	 	
	
	
=   2860 kg

Definitions
Absolute Ceiling The altitude at which the theoretical rate of climb, with all engines operating 
at maximum continuous power, is reduced to zero feet per minute 
Accelerate-stop Distance Available The distance from the point on the surface of the 
aerodrome at which the aeroplane can commence its take-off run to the nearest point in the 
direction of take-off at which the aeroplane cannot roll over the surface of the aerodrome and 
be brought to rest in an emergency without the risk of accident.  It is equal to TORA plus any 
available stopway.  
Aerodrome Any area of land or water designed, equipped, set apart or commonly used for 
affording facilities for the landing and departure of aircraft and includes any area or space, 
whether on the ground, on the roof of a building or elsewhere, which is designed, equipped or 
set apart for affording facilities for the landing and departure of aircraft capable of descending 
or climbing vertically, but shall not include any area the use of which for affording facilities for 
the landing and departure of aircraft has been abandoned and has not been resumed. 
Aerodrome Elevation The elevation of the highest point of the landing area. 
Aerodrome Reference Point The aerodrome reference point is the geographical location of 
the aerodrome and the centre of its traffic zone where an ATZ is established. 
Aerodynamic Ceiling The altitude, in unaccelerated 1g level flight, where the Mach number 
for the low speed and high speed buffet are coincident. 
Aeroplane A power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft, deriving its lift in flight chiefly from 
aerodynamic reactions on surfaces which remain fixed under given conditions of flight. 
Aircraft A machine that can derive support in the atmosphere from the reactions of the air 
other than the reactions of the air against the earth’s surface. 
Aircraft Classification Number (ACN) This is a value assigned to an aeroplane to show its load 
force.  The aircraft classification number must be compared to the pavement classification 
number (PCN) of an aerodrome.  The aircraft classification number may exceed the pavement 
classification number by as much as 50% but only if the manoeuvring of the aeroplane is very 
carefully monitored, otherwise significant damage may occur to both the aeroplane and the 
pavement.
Airframe The fuselage, booms, nacelles, cowlings, fairings, aerofoil surfaces (including rotors 
but excluding propellers and rotating aerofoils of engines), and landing gear of an aircraft and 
their accessories and controls. 
Air Minimum Control Speed The minimum speed at which directional control can be 
demonstrated when airborne with the critical engine inoperative and  the remaining engines 
at take-off thrust. Full opposite rudder and not more than 5 degrees of bank away from the 
inoperative engine are permitted when establishing this speed. VMCA may not exceed 1.2VSI or 
1.13VSR. 
Alternate Airport An airport at which an aircraft may land if a landing at the intended airport 
becomes inadvisable.

International Standard Atmosphere at which the prevailing pressure occurs. It may be obtained 
by setting the subscale of a pressure altimeter to 1013 hPa. 
Angle of Attack The angle between the chord line of the wing of an aircraft and the relative 
airflow. 
Apron A defined area on a land aerodrome provided for the stationing of aircraft for the 
embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, the loading and unloading of cargo, and for 
parking. 
Auxiliary Power Unit  Any gas turbine-powered unit delivering rotating shaft power, compressor 
air, or both which is not intended for direct propulsion of an aircraft.

off Distance Available is considered to have a balanced field length. 
Baulked Landing A landing manoeuvre that is unexpectedly discontinued. 
Brake Horsepower The power delivered at the main output shaft of an aircraft engine. 
Buffet Speed The speed at which the airflow over the wing separates creating turbulent airflow 
aft of the separation point which buffets the aeroplane.

equal to True Airspeed (TAS) at Mean Sea Level (MSL) in a Standard Atmosphere. 
Climb Gradient The ratio, in the same units of measurement, expressed as a percentage, as 
obtained from the formula:-  gradient = vertical interval ÷ horizontal interval × 100. 
Clearway An area beyond the runway, not less than 152 m (500 ft) wide, centrally located about 
the extended centre line of the runway, and under the control of the airport authorities. The 
clearway is expressed in terms of a clearway plane, extending from the end of the runway with 
an upward slope not exceeding 1·25%, above which no object or terrain protrudes. However, 
threshold lights may protrude above the plane if their height above the end of the runway is 
0·66 m (26 inches) or less and if they are located to each side of the runway.
Cloud Ceiling In relation to an aerodrome, cloud ceiling means the vertical distance from the 
elevation of the aerodrome to the lowest part of any cloud visible from the aerodrome which 
is sufficient to obscure more than one half of the sky so visible. 
Contaminated Runway A runway is considered to be contaminated when more than 25% of 
the runway surface area is covered by surface water, more than 3 mm deep.
Continuous One Engine Inoperative Power Rating The minimum test bed acceptance power, 
as stated in the engine type certificate data sheet, when running at the specified conditions 
and within the appropriate acceptance limitations. 
Continuous One Engine Inoperative Thrust Rating The minimum test bed acceptance thrust, 
as stated in the engine type certificate data sheet, when running at the specified conditions 
and within the appropriate acceptance limitations.

Performance - Introduction
Continuous One Engine Inoperative Power The power identified in the performance data 
for use after take-off when a power unit has failed or been shut down, during periods of 
unrestricted duration. 
Continuous One Engine Inoperative Thrust The thrust identified in the performance data 
for use after take-off when a power unit has failed or been shut down, during periods of 
unrestricted duration. 
Critical Engine The engine whose failure would most adversely affect the performance or 
handling qualities of an aircraft. 
Damp Runway A runway is considered damp when the surface is not dry, but when the 
moisture on it does not give it a shiny appearance. 
Declared Distances The distances declared by the aerodrome authority for the purpose of 
application of the requirement of the Air Navigation Order.  
Decision Speed The maximum speed in the take-off at which the pilot can take the first 
action (e.g. apply brakes, reduce thrust, deploy speed brakes) to stop the aeroplane within 
the accelerate-stop distance. It also means the minimum speed in the take-off, following a 
failure of the critical engine at VEF at which the pilot can continue the take-off and achieve the 
required height above the take-off surface within the take-off distance. 
Density Altitude The altitude in ISA, where the prevailing measured density occurs. 
Drag That force on an aeroplane which directly opposes thrust. 
Dry Runway A dry runway is one which is neither wet nor contaminated, and includes those 
paved runways which have been specially prepared with grooves or porous pavement and 
maintained to retain ‘effectively dry’ braking action even when moisture is present. 
Elevation The vertical distance of an object above mean sea level. This may be given in metres 
or feet. 
En Route The en route phase extends from 1500 ft above the take-off surface level to 1000 
ft above the landing aerodrome surface level for Class B aeroplanes or to 1500 ft above the 
landing aerodrome surface level for Class A aeroplanes. 
Equivalent Airspeed The calibrated airspeed corrected for compressibility at the particular 
pressure altitude under consideration.  It is equal to Calibrated Airspeed in a Standard 
Atmosphere.
Exhaust Gas Temperature The average temperature of the exhaust gas stream. 
Final En Route Climb Speed The speed of the aeroplane in segment four of the take-off flight 
path with one engine inoperative. 
Final Segment Speed The speed of the aeroplane in segment four of the take-off flight path 
with one engine inoperative. 
Final Take-off Speed The speed of the aeroplane that exists at the end of the take-off path in 
the en route configuration with one engine inoperative.

Fixed Pitch Propeller A propeller, the pitch of which cannot be changed.
Flap Extended Speed The highest speed permissible with wing flaps in a prescribed extended 
position. 
Flight Level A surface of constant atmospheric pressure that is related to 1013.25 hPa. It is 
conventionally the pressure altitude to the nearest 1000 ft in units of 100 ft.  For example, flight 
level 250 represents a pressure altitude of 25 000 ft. 
Frangibility The ability of an object to retain its structural integrity and stiffness up to a specified 
maximum load but when subject to a load greater than specified or struck by an aircraft will 
break, distort or yield in such a manner as to present minimum hazard to an aircraft. 
Go-around A procedure involving a decision to abort the landing and climb straight ahead to 
rejoin the circuit.  Such a decision might be taken at any time during the final approach, the 
transition phase or even after initial touchdown. 
Gross Height The true height attained at any point in the take-off flight path using gross climb 
performance. Gross height is used for calculating pressure altitudes for purposes of obstacle 
clearance and the height at which wing flap retraction is initiated. 
Gross Performance The average performance that a fleet of aeroplanes should achieve if 
satisfactorily maintained and flown in accordance with the techniques described in the manual. 
Ground Minimum Control Speed The minimum speed at which the aeroplane can be 
demonstrated to be controlled on the ground using only the primary flight controls when the 
most critical engine is suddenly made inoperative and the remaining engines are at take-off 
thrust. Throttling an opposite engine is not allowed in this demonstration. Forward pressure 
from the elevators is allowed to hold the nose wheel on the runway, however, nose wheel 
steering is not allowed. 
Height The vertical distance between the lowest part of the aeroplane and the relevant datum. 
Hydroplaning Speed   The speed at which the wheel is held off the runway by a depth of water 
and directional control through the wheel is impossible. 
ICAO Standard Atmosphere The atmosphere defined in ICAO Document 7488/2. For the 
purposes of Certification Specifications the following are acceptable:
•	 The air is a perfect dry gas
•	 The temperature at sea level is 15°C
•	 The pressure at sea level is 1013.2 hPa (29.92 in Hg)
•	 The temperature gradient from sea level to the altitude at which the temperature becomes 
–56.5°C is 0.65°C/100 m (1.98°C/1000 ft)
•	 The density at sea level under the above conditions is 1.2250 kg/m3 
IFR Conditions Weather conditions below the minimum for flight under visual flight rules. 
Indicated Airspeed The speed as shown by the pitot/static airspeed indicator calibrated to 
reflect Standard Atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at MSL and uncorrected for airspeed 
system errors.

Performance - Introduction
Missed Approach When an aircraft is caused to abort a landing after it has already started 
its landing approach.  The aircraft has to follow a set missed approach procedure to leave the 
airspace surrounding the terminal. 
Net Height The true height attained at any point in the take-off flight path using net climb 
performance. Net height is used to determine the net flight path that must clear all obstacles 
by the statutory minimum to comply with the Operating Regulations. 
Net Performance Net performance is the gross performance diminished to allow for various 
contingencies that cannot be accounted for operationally e.g. variations in piloting technique, 
temporary below average performance, etc. It is improbable that the net performance will not 
be achieved in operation, provided the aeroplane is flown in accordance with the recommended 
techniques. 
Outside Air Temperature The free air static (ambient) temperature. 
Pitch Setting The propeller blade setting determined by the blade angle, measured in a manner 
and at a radius declared by the manufacturer and specified in the appropriate Engine Manual. 
Pitch Motion of the aeroplane about its lateral axis. 
Pitot Tube A small tube whose open end collects Total Pressure. 
Pressure Altitude  The altitude of an aircraft above the pressure level of 1013.25 hPa.  This is 
achieved by setting the altimeter subscale to 1013 hPa and reading the altitude indicated. 
Reference Landing Speed The speed of the aeroplane, in a specified landing configuration, 
at the point where it descends through the landing screen height in the determination of the 
landing distance for manual landings.
Rejected Take-off (RTO) A  situation or event in which it is decided, for safety reasons, to 
abandon the take-off of an aircraft.
Roll Motion of the aeroplane about its longitudinal axis. 
Rotation Speed The speed at which, during the take-off, rotation is initiated with the intention 
of becoming airborne. 
Runway A defined rectangular area on a land aerodrome prepared for the landing and take-
off run of aircraft along its length. 
Runway Strip An area of specified dimensions enclosing a runway intended to reduce the risk 
of damage to an aircraft running off the runway and to protect aircraft flying over it when 
taking off or landing. 
Runway Threshold  The beginning of that portion of the runway usable for landing. 
Screen  An imaginary barrier, located at the end of the Take-off Distance Available (TODA) 
or the beginning of the Landing Distance Available (LDA). The screen is of no operational 
significance, but the test pilots use the height of the screen when assessing the performance 
of the aeroplane.
Service Ceiling  The pressure altitude at which the rate of climb is reduced to a specified 
minimum value (approximately 300 ft/min).

Specific Fuel Consumption Fuel flow per unit thrust.  The lower the value, the more efficient 
the engine. 
Stopway An area beyond the take-off runway, no less wide than the runway and centred upon 
the extended centre line of the runway, able to support the aeroplane during an aborted 
take-off, without causing structural damage to the aeroplane, and designated by the airport 
authorities for use in decelerating the aeroplane during an aborted take-off.
Take-off Distance Available. It is equal to TORA plus any clearway and cannot be more than 
one and one half times the TORA, whichever is the less. 
Take-off Mass The mass of an aeroplane, including everything and everyone contained within 
it, at the start of the take-off run. 
Take-off Power The output shaft power identified in the performance data for use during take-
off, discontinued approach and baulked landing:
i. for piston engines, it is limited in use to a continuous period of not more than 5 minutes;
ii. for turbine engines installed in aeroplanes and helicopters, limited in use to a continuous 
period of not more than 5 minutes; and
iii. for turbine engines installed in aeroplanes only (when specifically requested), limited in use 
to a continuous period of not more than 10 minutes in the event of a power unit having failed 
or been shut down. 
Take-off Run Available The distance from the point on the surface of the aerodrome at which 
the aeroplane can commence its take-off run to the nearest point in the direction of take-off at 
which the surface of the aerodrome is incapable of bearing the weight of the aeroplane under 
normal operating conditions. 
Take-off Safety Speed A referenced airspeed obtained after lift-off at which the required one 
engine-inoperative climb performance can be achieved. 
Take-off Thrust  The output shaft thrust identified in the performance data for use during take-
off, discontinued approach and baulked landing:
i. for piston engines, it is limited in use to a continuous period of not more than 5 minutes;
ii. for turbine engines installed in aeroplanes and helicopters, limited in use to a continuous 
period of not more than 5 minutes; and
iii. for turbine engines installed in aeroplanes only, limited in use to a continuous period of not 
more than 10 minutes in the event of a power unit having failed or been shut down. 
Taxiway A defined path on a land aerodrome established for the taxiing of aircraft and 
intended to provide a link between one part of the aerodrome and another. 
Thrust That force acting on an aeroplane produced by the engine(s) in a forward direction.

Turboprop An aircraft having a jet engine in which the energy of the jet operates a turbine that 
drives the propeller.  Turboprops are often used on regional and business aircraft because of 
their relative efficiency at speeds slower than, and altitudes lower than, those of a typical jet. 
Variable Pitch Propellers A propeller, the pitch setting of which changes or can be changed, 
when the propeller is rotating or stationary. 
VEF The calibrated airspeed at which the critical engine is assumed to fail and is used for the 
purpose of performance calculations.  It is never less than VMCG.
V1 Referred to as the decision speed. Engine failure prior to V1 demands that the pilot must 
reject the take-off because there is insufficient distance remaining to enable the aircraft to 
safely continue the take-off. Engine failure at or faster than V1 demands that the pilot must 
continue the take-off because there is insufficient distance remaining to safely bring the aircraft 
to a stop.  
Wet Runway A runway is considered wet when the runway surface is covered with water, 
or equivalent moisture on the runway surface to cause it to appear reflective, but without 
significant areas of standing water. 
Windshear Localized change in wind speed and/or direction over a short distance, resulting 
in a tearing or shearing effect that can cause a sudden change of airspeed with occasionally 
disastrous results if encountered when taking off or landing. 
Yaw Motion of an aeroplane about its normal axis. 
Zero Flap Speed The minimum safe manoeuvring speed with zero flap selected.

EU-OPS Performance Classification
Performance Class A
Multi-engine aeroplanes powered by turbo-propeller engines with a maximum approved 
passenger seating configuration of more than 9 or a maximum take-off mass exceeding
5700 kg, and all multi-engine turbojet powered aeroplanes.  Class A aeroplanes must abide by 
the Certification Specifications laid out in the document from EASA called CS-25.
Performance Class B
Propeller driven aeroplanes with a maximum approved passenger seating configuration of 9 
or less, and a maximum take-off mass of 5700 kg or less.  Class B aeroplanes must abide by the 
Certification Specifications laid out in the document from EASA called CS-23.
Performance Class C
Aeroplanes powered by reciprocating engines with a maximum approved passenger seating 
configuration of more than 9 or a maximum take-off mass exceeding 5700 kg.
Unclassified
This class is given to those aeroplanes whose performance characteristic is unique and special 
performance consideration is required.  For example, the Unclassified class includes supersonic 
aeroplanes and sea planes.

Performance Expressions 
Any class of aeroplane operated in the public transport role must adhere to the operational 
requirements set out in EU-OPS 1.  EU-OPS 1 prescribes a minimum performance level for each 
stage of flight for Class A, Class B and Class C aeroplanes.  The certification and operational 
regulations together aim to achieve a high standard of safety that has kept air travel as the 
safest form of travel.  To achieve the required safety standard, the aviation authorities have 
added a safety margin into the aeroplane performance data.  The application of these safety 
margins changes the expression of the performance data.

Performance - Introduction
Measured Performance
This is the performance achieved by the manufacturer under test conditions for certification. 
It utilizes new aeroplanes and test pilots and is therefore unrepresentative of the performance 
that will be achieved by an average fleet of aeroplanes.
Gross Performance
Gross performance is the average performance that a fleet of aeroplanes should achieve if 
satisfactorily maintained and flown in accordance with the techniques described in the manual. 
Therefore, gross performance is measured performance reduced by a set margin to reflect 
average operating performance.
Net Performance
Net performance is the gross performance diminished to allow for various contingencies that 
cannot be accounted for operationally e.g. variations in piloting technique, temporary below 
average performance, etc. It is improbable that the net performance will not be achieved in 
operation, provided the aeroplane is flown in accordance with the recommended techniques. 
This level of performance is approximately 5 standard deviations from the average performance 
or gross performance. Therefore, 99.99994% of the time, the aeroplane will achieve net 
performance or better.  However, there is less than one chance in a million that the aeroplane 
will not achieve the net performance.  This is the safety standard which the aviation authorities 
aim to achieve.

General Principles - Take-off
Take-off
The take-off part of the flight is the distance from the brake release point (BRP) to the point at 
which the aircraft reaches a defined height.  This defined height is termed the “screen height”. 
The screen height varies from 35 ft for Class A aeroplanes to 50 ft for Class B aeroplanes.
For any particular take-off, it must be shown that the distance required for take-off in the 
prevailing conditions does not exceed the distance available at the take-off aerodrome. 
However, there are various terms used to describe the available distances at an aerodrome.
Available Distances
Some aerodromes have extra distances associated with the main runway which are used in a 
variety of ways. Before we look at these distances, we need to define two areas associated 
with the runway.
Clearways
Clearways are an area beyond the runway, not less than 152 m (500 ft) wide, centrally located 
about the extended centre line of the runway, and under the control of the airport authorities. 
The clearway is expressed in terms of a clearway plane, extending from the end of the runway 
with an upward slope not exceeding 1.25%, above which no object or terrain protrudes. 
However, threshold lights may protrude above the plane if their height above the end of 
the runway is 0.66 m (26 inches) or less and if they are located to each side of the runway. 
Clearways are not physical structures; they are simply an area of defined width and length 
which are free of obstacles.
Figure 2.1 Clearways extend from the end of the runway with an upward slope not exceeding 1.25%, above which 
no object or terrain protrudes

General Principles - Take-off
Stopways
Stopways are an area beyond the take-off runway, no less wide than the runway and centred 
upon the extended centre line of the runway, able to support the aeroplane during a Rejected 
Take-off (RTO), without causing structural damage to the aeroplane, and designated by the 
airport authorities for use in decelerating the aeroplane during a rejected take-off.  Stopways 
are physical structures and are usually paved.  However, stopways are not as strong as the main 
length of runway and therefore are only used to help bring an aeroplane to a stop in the event 
of a rejected take-off.  Stopways are identified by large yellow chevrons on either end of the 
main runway.
Figure 2.2 Stopways are able to support the aeroplane during a rejected take-off and are marked by large yellow 
chevrons
Understanding stopways and clearways is essential when examining the available distances 
published at aerodromes.  There are four principal aerodrome distances, although only three 
will apply to the take-off and these are discussed next.

The Take-off Run Available (TORA)
The take-off run available is the distance from the point on the surface of the aerodrome 
at which the aeroplane can commence its take-off run to the nearest point in the direction 
of take-off at which the surface of the aerodrome is incapable of bearing the weight of the 
aeroplane under normal operating conditions.  At most aerodromes the take-off run available 
is the length of the runway from threshold to threshold.
The Take-off Distance Available (TODA)
The take-off distance available is the take-off run available plus any clearway (TORA + clearway). 
If there is no clearway at the aerodrome then the take-off distance available will be the same 
length as the take-off run available. 
The take-off distance available must be compared to the aeroplane’s actual take-off distance. 
The requirements for take-off state that the aeroplane must be able to complete the take-off 
within the take-off distance available.  Although clearways can be of any length, there is a limit 
to the amount of clearway that can be used when calculating the TODA.  The maximum length 
of clearway in this case cannot be more than half the length of the TORA.
The  Accelerate-stop Distance Available or Emergency Distance 
Available (ASDA/EMDA)
The accelerate-stop distance available is the length of take-off run available plus any stopway 
(TORA + stopway).  If there is no stopway at the aerodrome then the accelerate-stop distance 
available will be the same length as the take-off run available.
The accelerate-stop distance available must be compared to the aeroplane’s actual accelerate- 
stop distance.  The requirements for take-off state that the aeroplane’s accelerate-stop distance 
must not exceed the accelerate-stop distance available.

Required Distances
The distance required for take-off may be considered as two segments:
•	 The take-off roll or ground run.
•	 The airborne distance to a “screen” of defined height.
The total distance from the brake release point to the screen height is called the Take-off 
Distance (TOD).  The speed at which the pilot will attempt to raise the nose wheel off the 
ground is called “VR”.  This is the speed for rotation.  At this speed the pilot will pull back on the 
control column and eventually the nose wheel will lift off the runway. This action will increase 
the lift and eventually the main wheels themselves will lift off the runway.  The speed at which 
this occurs is called “VLOF” which means the speed for lift-off.
Figure 2.5 The take-off distance (TOD) is the total distance from brake release until the screen height
Calculating the take-off distance is an important consideration but it is essential to a pilot to 
understand that there is a chance, albeit a remote chance, that the actual calculated take-off 
distance will not be achieved. To this end, the aviation authorities have created a set of safety 
regulations to ensure that poor performance is accounted for in the calculations.  These safety 
regulations require factors to be applied to the estimated distances to give a satisfactory safety 
margin.  The application of safety factors changes the terminology used.  The calculated take-
off distance is called the Gross Take-off Distance, but applying the safety factors changes this to 
the Net Take-off Distance.  The regulations and their associated safety factors will be discussed 
later in the relevant chapters on the different classes of aeroplanes.

Calculating the Take-off Distance
The two formulae shown below are used to help understand the key components in calculating 
the take-off distance.  The upper formula is used to calculate the distance required (s) to reach 
a specified speed (V) with a given acceleration (a).   Beneath the first formula is the formula to 
calculate that acceleration.  
s =  V2
a      
Figure 2.6 Forces in the take-off
For an aircraft taking off, the acceleration is thrust minus drag.  However, both of these forces 
will change as the speed changes, and so the acceleration will not be constant during the 
take-off.  Also, during the airborne part of the take-off, the laws of motion will be somewhat 
different, and the upper formula will change somewhat, but the distance required will still 
depend on the speed to be achieved and the acceleration.
Forces During Take-off
Figure 2.7 Forces in the take-off
Looking back at the formula for acceleration during take-off it can be seen that thrust and drag 
play a crucial part in the take-off performance.  Therefore a little extra detail will be covered 
on these two important forces.

General Principles - Take-off
Thrust
The engine thrust will vary during take-off, and the variation of thrust with speed will be 
different for jet and propeller engines.
•	 Jet engine.  For a jet engine the net thrust is the difference between the gross thrust and 
the intake momentum drag.  Increasing speed increases the intake momentum drag, which 
reduces the thrust.  However, at higher speeds the increased intake pressure due to ram 
effect helps to reduce this loss of thrust, and eventually at very high speeds it will cause 
the net thrust to increase again.  During take-off the aeroplane speed is still low and as 
such the ram effect is insufficient to counteract the loss of thrust due to intake momentum 
drag, therefore during the take-off there will be a decrease of thrust.  In later chapters and 
in some performance graphs you will notice that the assumption is made that jet thrust is 
constant with speed.  This is done so as to simplify some of the teaching points.
Figure 2.8 Net thrust with speed for a typical modern jet engine
•	 Flat rated engines.  The thrust produced by an engine at a given rpm will depend on 
the air density, and hence on air pressure and temperature. At a given pressure altitude, 
decreasing temperature will give increasing thrust. However, many jet engines are “flat 
rated”, that is, they are restricted to a maximum thrust even though the engine is capable of 
producing higher thrust. The reason being that at lower temperatures too much thrust may 
be generated and the pressures within the compressors may be exceeded.  Consequently at 
temperatures below the flat rating cut off, (typically about ISA + 15°C) engine thrust is not 
affected by temperature.

Figure 2.9 Typical thrust with air temperature from a flat rated engine
Propeller.  For a propeller driven aircraft, thrust is produced by a propeller converting the 
shaft torque into propulsive force. For a fixed pitch propeller, angle of attack decreases as 
forward speed increases.  Thrust therefore decreases with increasing speed. For a variable pitch 
propeller, the propeller will initially be held in the fine pitch position during take-off and the 
propeller angle of attack will decrease with increasing speed.  Above the selected rpm the 
propeller governor will come into operation, increasing the propeller pitch, and reducing the 
rate at which the thrust decreases.  In summary therefore, the thrust of a propeller aeroplane 
decreases with forward speed.
Figure 2.10 Typical thrust with speed from a propeller powered engine
Supercharged engines.  If the engine is un-supercharged, the power produced will decrease 
with decreasing density (higher temperature or lower pressure). For a supercharged engine, 
power may be maintained with increasing altitude, up to the Full Throttle Height.

Drag
The total drag (D) of an aeroplane during take-off is a product of both aerodynamic drag (DA) 
and wheel drag/wheel friction (µ) as shown in the formula below. 
D = DA + μ(W - L)
•	 Aerodynamic Drag.  There are principally two forms of aerodynamic drag, parasite drag 
and induced drag.  Parasite drag is increased by the square of the speed, therefore this 
form of drag will increase during the take-off.  Induced drag is a function of the angle of 
attack. This angle of attack is constant until the aeroplane rotates at which point the angle 
of attack increases dramatically.  Therefore induced drag will increase during the take-off.
•	 Wheel Drag.  The wheel drag depends on the load on the wheel (W - L) and the runway 
surface resistance (µ). At the start of the take-off the load on the wheels is the entire weight 
of the aeroplane, therefore wheel friction and wheel drag is high.  However, as forward 
speed increases, lift starts to counteract the weight force and this reduces the load on the 
wheels.  Therefore the wheel friction and the wheel drag will reduce, eventually being zero 
at lift-off.
The increase of aerodynamic drag is much higher than the decrease of wheel drag, therefore 
total drag during the take-off increases.
Summary of Forces
In summary then, for all aeroplanes during the take-off, thrust decreases and drag increases. 
The acceleration force is determined by subtracting the total drag from the total thrust.  This is 
visually represented in the next graph by the area between the total drag line and the thrust 
line.  When thrust is more than drag the term “excess thrust” is used.  Excess thrust is what is 
needed to accelerate the aeroplane.   You can see from the graph that the excess thrust and 
therefore the acceleration of the aeroplane decreases during the take-off.  The term “excess 
thrust” will be used again when climb theory is introduced.

Take-off Speed
The speed (V) in the take-off distance formula is True Ground Speed.  When calculating the 
take-off run required, account must therefore be taken of the effect of density on TAS for a 
given IAS, and of the effect of wind on TGS for a given TAS.
The speed to be reached at the screen (the Take-off Safety Speed) is determined by the 
Regulations, and is required to be a safe margin above the stall speed and the minimum 
control speed, a speed that gives adequate climb performance, and that takes account of the 
acceleration that will occur after lift-off.  It is very important to ensure this speed is achieved by 
the screen height.  
Effect of Variable Factors on Take-off Distance
Mass  
The mass of the aeroplane affects:
•	 The acceleration for a given accelerating force.  This is the effect of inertia.  An aeroplane 
with higher mass will have more inertia.  Therefore as mass increases, acceleration will 
decrease which will increase the take-off distance.
•	 The  wheel  drag.  Increased  mass  increases  the  load placed on the wheels and therefore 
increases the wheel friction.  Because of the increased wheel friction, wheel drag will 
increase.  Therefore, acceleration is reduced and the take-off distance will increase.
•	 The take-off safety speed.  An aeroplane with a higher mass will have a greater force of 
weight.  This must be overcome by greater lift.  To gain this extra lift the aeroplane must be 
accelerated to a higher speed, which will of course increase the take-off distance.
•	 The angle of initial climb to the screen height.  This effect will be better understood in the 
next chapter, but nonetheless a higher mass reduces the angle of the initial climb.  This 
means that the aeroplane will use a greater horizontal distance to get to the screen height.
In summary then, increasing mass has four detrimental effects on the take-off distance.
Air Density
Density is determined by pressure, temperature and humidity. Density affects:
•	 The power or thrust of the engine.  Reduced density will reduce combustion inside the engine 
and therefore reduce the thrust and/or power that the engine can generate.  Therefore, 
acceleration will be less and the take-off distance will increase.
•	 The TAS for a given IAS.  Reduced density will increase the true airspeed for a given indicated 
airspeed.  For example, if the take-off safety speed was an indicated airspeed of 120 knots, 
then in low density this may represent a true airspeed of 130 knots.  Getting to a true speed 
of 130 knots will require more distance.  Therefore, low density will increase the take-off 
distance.
•	 The angle of the initial climb.  Since there is less thrust and/or power in low density, the 
angle of climb will reduce.  Therefore, getting to the screen height will require a longer 
horizontal distance.

General Principles - Take-off
Wind
Winds affect the true ground speed of the aeroplane for any given true airspeed.  
Headwinds will reduce the ground speed at the required take-off airspeed and reduce the 
take-off distance.  For example, with a headwind of 20 knots and a true airspeed for the 
take-off safety speed being 120 knots, the ground speed is only 100 knots.  Getting to a true 
ground speed of only 100 knots will require less distance.  Another benefit is that headwinds 
also increase the angle of the initial climb which will further reduce the required distance. 
Therefore, headwinds reduce the take-off distance and  it is this reason why pilots always aim 
to take off into wind.
A tailwind does the opposite to a headwind.  Tailwinds will increase the ground speed and 
increase the take-off distance.
The Regulations for all classes of aircraft require that in calculating the take-off distance, no 
more than 50% of the headwind component is assumed and no less than 150% of a tailwind 
component is assumed.  This is to allow for variations in the reported winds during take-off.  
For example, it would not be wise to plan a distance limited take-off with 10 knots headwind 
if at the actual time of take-off the wind was less than 10 knots.  In this case, the aeroplane 
would not be able to complete the take-off within the available distance.  Most aeroplane 
performance manuals and operating handbooks already have the wind rules factored into the 
take-off graphs or tables.  In this case, simply use the forecast wind and the graph or table will 
automatically correct the take-off distance to account for the regulation on wind.
Note:  For any headwind the distance required to take off will be less than the calculated 
distance, as only half the headwind is allowed for. Equally for any tailwind the distance required 
will be less, as a stronger tailwind is allowed for. If the wind is a 90° crosswind, the distance 
required to take off will be the same as the distance calculated for zero wind component.
Runway Slope
If the runway is sloping, a component of the weight will act along the longitudinal axis of the 
aeroplane.  This will either augment thrust or augment drag which will increase or decrease 
the accelerating force.  The amount of weight augmenting either thrust or drag is called either 
“weight apparent thrust” or “weight apparent drag.”  It can be calculated by multiplying the 
force of weight by the sine of the angle of the runway slope.
Figure 2.12 On a downslope a proportion of weight acts in the direction of thrust
A downhill slope will increase the accelerating force, and reduce the take-off distance, whereas 
an uphill slope will reduce the accelerating force and increase the take-off distance.
--- Page 161 ---

Runway Surface
Even on a smooth runway there will be rolling resistance due to the bearing friction and 
tyre distortion. If the runway is contaminated by snow, slush or standing water, there will be 
additional drag due to fluid resistance and impingement.  This drag will increase with speed, 
until a critical speed is reached, the hydroplaning speed, above which the drag will start to 
decrease.  Any contamination will increase the drag and hence increase the take-off distance.
If the take-off is rejected and braking is required, the coefficient of braking friction is severely 
reduced on a runway which is wet, icy or contaminated by snow or slush.  This means that the 
brake pressure must be severely reduced to prevent skidding.  Thus the stopping distance is 
greatly increased.
Figure 2.13 The effect of slush density on the slush drag
Airframe Contamination
The performance data given assumes that the aircraft is not contaminated by frost, ice or snow 
during take-off.   In fact it is a requirement that at the commencement of take-off the aeroplane 
must be free of ice or snow.  Snow and ice on the airframe will increase the drag, reduce the lift 
and increase the weight of the aeroplane.  Therefore, if any of these contaminants are present, 
the performance of the aircraft will be reduced, and the take-off distance will be increased.
Flap Setting
Flaps affect:
•	 The CLMAX of the wing
•	 The drag
Increasing flap angle increases CLMAX, which reduces stalling speed and take-off speed. This 
reduces the take-off distance.
Increasing flap angle increases drag, reducing acceleration, and increasing the take-off 
distance. The net effect is that take-off distance will decrease with increase of flap angle but 
above a certain flap angle the take-off distance will increase again. An optimum setting can be 
determined for each type of aircraft, and any deviation from this setting will give an increase 
in the take-off distance.

Flap Angle
Take-oﬀ Distance Required

The flap setting will also affect the climb gradient, and this will affect the Maximum Mass 
for Altitude and Temperature, which is determined by a climb gradient requirement, and the 
clearance of obstacles in the take-off flight path.Increasing the flap angle increases the drag, 
and so reduces the climb gradient for a given aircraft mass.  The maximum permissible mass for 
the required gradient will therefore be reduced.  In hot and high conditions this could make 
the Mass-Altitude-Temperature requirement more limiting than the field length requirement 
if the flap setting for the shortest take-off distance is used. A greater take-off mass may be 
obtained in these conditions by using a lower flap angle.

If there are obstacles to be considered in the take-off flight path, the flap setting that gives 
the shortest take-off distance may not give the maximum possible take-off mass if the Take-
off Distance Available is greater than the Take-off Distance Required. If close-in obstacles are 
not cleared, using a lower flap angle will use a greater proportion of the Take-off Distance 
Available but may give a sufficiently improved gradient to clear the obstacles

Climb
The climb section of aircraft performance deals with the analysis of that stage of flight from 
the end of the take-off phase to the beginning of the en route phase.  There are two ways in 
which climbing needs to be examined; the angle of climb and the rate of climb.

Angle of Climb
Angle of climb will be examined first. Figure 3.1 shows an aircraft in unaccelerated level 
flight. Notice that the forward acting force, Thrust, balances the rearward acting force, 
Drag.  Therefore, the aircraft will maintain a steady speed.  How much Thrust is required for 
unaccelerated level flight?  The same as the aerodynamic Drag.  A frequently used alternative 
term for Drag is “Thrust Required”.

However, if the aircraft is placed in a climb attitude, as shown in Figure 3.2, a component of the 
aeroplane’s Weight acts backwards along the flight path and is added to Drag.

The larger the angle of climb, the larger the backward component of Weight, as shown in 
Figure 3.3.  In both illustrations it is apparent that the sum of the two rearward acting forces is 
greater than the forward acting force.  If this situation were left unchanged the aircraft would 
decelerate.

Excess Thrust
To maintain a steady speed along the flight path in a climb, additional Thrust is required to 
balance the backward component of Weight. This additional Thrust required is called Excess 
Thrust.
Excess Thrust is the Thrust available from the engine(s) after aerodynamic Drag is balanced.

From Figure 3.4 it can be seen that the forward acting force in green is now the same as the 
two rearward acting forces in red and the aeroplane will maintain a steady speed along its new 
flight path.  To maintain a steady climb with no loss of speed, Thrust must balance not only the 
aerodynamic Drag, but also the backward component of Weight.

In Figure 3.5 the aircraft only has a small amount of Excess Thrust available.  Notice that there 
is too much backward component of Weight from the climb angle that has been set, so that 
climb angle can not be maintained.

larger the backward component of Weight that can be balanced.

Figure 3.8 
Weight has an influence on climb performance. Figure 3.7 illustrates that if the aircraft tries 
to use the same climb angle as before, but at a higher weight, the backward component of 
weight will be greater and there is insufficient Excess Thrust to balance it.  In addition, the 
higher weight will also generate increased aerodynamic Drag (Induced), which will further 
reduce Excess Thrust.  Increased weight therefore decreases the maximum climb angle, as 
shown in Figure 3.8.

Figure 3.9 shows that Thrust Available is the total amount of Thrust available from the engine(s) 
and under a given set of conditions and in a steady climb the thrust available  must be the same 
as the sum of the aerodynamic Drag (D) plus the backward component of Weight (W sin γ) .

General Principles - Climb
Calculating Climb Gradient
If Thrust Available and aerodynamic Drag are known, the maximum backward component of 
Weight can be calculated by subtracting the aerodynamic Drag from Thrust Available.  For most 
purposes, climb gradient is used rather than climb angle, but climb angle is still an important 
factor.  Climb gradient is merely the percentage of the backward component of Weight to the 
aircraft Weight.
Shown here is the formula to calculate the percentage climb gradient.  This formula is very 
significant.
Gradient %      =  
 ×  100
T   -   D
W
Merely by looking at the above formula certain facts are self-evident:
•	 For a given weight, the greater the “Excess Thrust” (T – D) the steeper the climb gradient. 
The less the Excess Thrust the more shallow the climb gradient.
•	 For a given Excess Thrust (T – D), the greater the weight the more shallow the climb gradient. 
The less the weight the steeper the climb gradient.
If representative values of Thrust, Drag and Weight are known, the % climb gradient can be 
calculated. For example:
A twin engine turbojet aircraft has engines of 60 000 N each; its mass is 50 tonnes and it has a 
L/D ratio of 12:1, what is the % climb gradient?    Use ‘g’ = 10 m/s/s.
From the above information the values to include in the formula have to be derived:
Thrust = 60 000 N × 2 engines = 120 000 N
Drag = Weight / 12
Weight = 50 tonnes × 1000 = 50 000 kg × 10 m/s/s = 500 000 N
Drag therefore = 500 000 N / 12 = 41 667 N
120 000 N - 41 667 N
500 000 N
×100 =
78 333 N
500 000 N
× 100 = 15.7%
Let us now consider the same values, but with one engine failed:
60 000 N  -  41 667 N
500 000 N
× 100 = 3.7%
Thrust has decreased by 50%, but climb gradient has decreased by approximately 75% or to 
one quarter of the gradient possible with all engines operating.  This fact is very significant. 
After losing 50% of the Thrust Available, why did the gradient decrease by 75%? 
Note:  The aircraft data gave the L/D ratio from which the value of Drag was extracted, yet the 
value of Lift is obviously less than Weight when the aircraft is in a steady climb.  Isn’t this an 
inaccurate value?  If the climb angle is less than approximately 20 degrees, and it always will be, 
the difference in the magnitude of Lift and Weight in a steady climb is insignificant and they can 
be considered (for purposes of these and other calculations) to be the same.

Climbing after an Engine Failure
Consider Figure 3.10:  Losing 50% of the Thrust Available reduces Excess Thrust by approximately 
75% because the same value of aerodynamic Drag must still be balanced.  Figure 3.11 emphasizes 
that a two-engine aeroplane with one engine inoperative, has a severely reduced ability to 
climb.

The Effect of Flaps on Climbing
High lift devices (flaps) increase aerodynamic Drag.  From the study of Principles of Flight it 
was learned that the purpose of flaps is to reduce the take-off and landing run.  Figure 3.12 
and Figure 3.13 show it is obvious that flaps reduce the climb angle because they increase 
aerodynamic Drag and therefore decrease Excess Thrust.

The Climb Angle - Gamma
Figure 3.14 includes the symbol used for climb angle, the Greek letter GAMMA (γ).  Note that 
the angle between the horizontal and the flight path (climb angle) is exactly the same as the 
angle between the Weight vector and the transposed Lift vector.  We will be using climb angle 
for the FREE AIR climb.

Figure 3.14 
When an aeroplane is in a steady climb there will be a gain in height after a given horizontal 
distance travelled.  This relationship is the % climb gradient.  The calculation on page 48 gave 
15.7% climb gradient, all engines.  From Figure 3.14 it can be visualized that for 100 units of 
horizontal travel, the aeroplane will be 15.7 units higher.  This is a fundamental concept.  
For example:  an aircraft with a climb gradient of 15.7%  all engines operating, will be 314 ft 
higher after travelling 2000 ft horizontally, but the one engine inoperative climb gradient of 
3.7%, will only give a height gain of 74 ft in the same distance.
Horizontal distance = 2000 ft
Gradient = 15.7%  (For every 100 ft horizontally, a height gain of 15.7 ft)
	
2000 ft
100
= 20
	
	    20   ×   15.7 ft   =   314 ft (All engines)
Gradient = 3.7%  (For every 100 ft horizontally, a height gain of 3.7 ft)
	       20   ×   3.7 ft   =   74 ft (One engine inoperative)

Parasite Drag Curve
An easy way to visualize how an aeroplane can maximize Excess Thrust and therefore its climb 
angle is to use a simple graph showing the relationship between Thrust and Drag under various 
conditions.  But first, the parts of the Drag curve will be studied in detail.
PARASITE
DRAG
IAS
Figure 3.15 
Figure 3.15 shows Parasite Drag increasing with the square of the IAS. (Parasite Drag is 
proportional to IAS squared). If IAS is doubled, Parasite Drag will be increased four times.  Note 
that at low speed Parasite Drag is small, but reaches a maximum at high IAS.  Parasite Drag will 
increase with increasing “Parasite Area” (flaps, undercarriage or speed brakes).
Induced Drag Curve
INDUCED
DRAG
IAS
Figure 3.16 
Figure 3.16 shows Induced Drag decreasing with IAS squared.  (Induced Drag is inversely 
proportional to IAS squared).  If IAS is doubled, Induced Drag will be decreased to one quarter 
of its previous value.  Note that Induced Drag is at its highest value at low IAS, but decreases 
with increasing IAS.  Induced Drag will vary with Lift production.  Increasing the Weight or 
banking the aircraft will increase Induced Drag.

Figure 3.17 
In flight, an aeroplane will experience both Parasite and Induced Drag.  The sum of Parasite 
Drag and Induced Drag is called Total Drag.  When only the word Drag is mentioned, the 
meaning is Total Drag.  Figure 3.17 shows a Total Drag curve:
•	 At any given IAS, Total Drag is the sum of Parasite Drag and Induced Drag.
•	 The IAS at which Parasite Drag is the same value as Induced Drag will generate minimum 
Total Drag.
•	 The IAS that gives minimum Total Drag, is called “The Minimum Drag Speed” and is called 
VMD.
•	 Flying at an IAS slower than VMD will generate more Drag and flying at an IAS faster than 
VMD will also generate more Drag.
Whenever Drag is being considered it is an excellent idea to develop the habit of sketching the 
Total Drag curve, together with the Parasite Drag and Induced Drag curves.  This enables the 
result of any variable to be included and the correct conclusion obtained.

Figure 3.18 shows the effect of increased Weight and/or the effect of turning the aircraft. 
Induced Drag will be greater at a given IAS because Lift must be increased when the aircraft has 
more weight or when turning. The reason for the proportionally greater increase in Induced 
Drag at the low speed end of the graph is because Induced Drag is inversely proportional to 
IAS squared – therefore, at low speed the effect is greater.
The intersection of the Induced Drag curve and the Parasite Drag curve is further towards the 
high speed end of the graph and the sum of Induced Drag and Parasite is greater. Total Drag 
will increase and VMD will be a faster IAS when an aircraft is operating at increased Weight or 
when turning.
Conversely, throughout flight Weight will decrease due to fuel use.  As the aircraft becomes 
lighter, Total Drag will decrease and the IAS for VMD will also decrease.

reason for the proportionally greater increase in Parasite Drag at the high speed end of the 
graph is because Parasite Drag is proportional to IAS squared – therefore, at high speed, the 
effect is greater.  The intersection of the parasite Drag curve and the Induced Drag curve is 
further towards the low speed end of the graph and the sum of Parasite Drag and Induced 
Drag is greater.  Total Drag will increase and VMD will be a lower IAS when either the flaps or 
gear are lowered.
Thrust
Thrust is the force required to balance aerodynamic Drag; plus the backward component of 
Weight when the aircraft is in a steady climb.  A turbojet engine generates Thrust by accelerating 
a mass of air rearwards.  The variation of Thrust Available with forward speed is relatively 
small and the engine output is nearly constant with changes in IAS.
Thrust Available  =  Mass Flow  ×  Acceleration (Exhaust velocity - Intake velocity)
Since an increase in speed will increase the magnitude of intake velocity, constant Thrust 
Available will only be obtained if there is an increase in mass flow or exhaust velocity.  When 
the aircraft is at low forward speed, any increase in speed will reduce the velocity change 
through the engine without a corresponding increase in mass flow and Thrust Available will 
decrease slightly.  When the aircraft is flying at higher speed, the ram effect helps to increase 
mass flow with increasing forward speed and Thrust Available no longer decreases, but 
actually increases slightly with speed.

Because turbojet thrust is essentially constant with speed, unless the take-off run is being 
considered, future illustrations will display Thrust Available from the turbojet as a straight line.
Variation of  Thrust with Density Altitude
A turbojet engine is un-supercharged.  Increasing Density Altitude (lower air density) will 
reduce the mass flow through the engine and Thrust Available will decrease.  Obviously, this 
will have an effect when climbing, but also when operating at airfields with a High Pressure 
Altitude and/or a high Outside Air Temperature (OAT).  As a reminder, Pressure Altitude can be 
determined on the ground by setting 1013 hPa on the altimeter subscale.  If the altimeter reads 
1000 ft on the ground with 1013 on the subscale, the Pressure Altitude is 1000 ft, irrespective of 
the actual height of the airfield above sea level. (The aeroplane will experience the air pressure 
that corresponds to 1000 ft in the International Standard Atmosphere).

Generally, the Thrust of any turbojet engine is restricted by the maximum temperature the 
turbine blades can withstand.  The more heat resistant the material from which the turbine 
blades are made and the more efficient the blade cooling, the higher the maximum turbine 
inlet temperature and therefore the greater the Thrust the engine can safely develop.

For a given engine, the higher the OAT the lower the mass air flow and therefore the lower 
the fuel flow before the maximum turbine inlet temperature is reached and consequently, the 
lower the Thrust the engine is able to develop – this is known as EGT limited Thrust.
Figure 3.22 should be read from right to left, and shows Thrust increasing with decreasing 
OAT at a given Pressure Altitude, but only down to an OAT of ISA + 15°C.  Below ISA + 15°C 
Thrust remains constant.  This is the engine’s “Flat Rated” Thrust.  At OATs below ISA + 15°C, 
Thrust is no longer limited by turbine inlet temperature but by the maximum air pressure the 
compressor is built to withstand.  Below airport OATs of ISA + 15°C it does not matter how far 
the flight crew advance the throttle, the engine management computer will maintain “Flat 
Rated” Thrust – this is the maximum certified Thrust of the engine.
From a Performance point of view, if engines are not “Flat Rated” and the throttles are fully 
advanced at OATs below ISA + 15°C a lot more than maximum certified Thrust will be delivered. 
While this may not be immediately destructive to the engine if done occasionally, it completely 
compromises the certification of the aeroplane.  Engine-out critical speeds (VMCG, VMCA and VMCL) 
are based on the yawing moment generated at maximum certified Thrust.  If significantly more 
Thrust is produced during one-engine-out flight with the IAS at the recommended minimum, 
directional control of the aeroplane will be lost.
Some Performance graphs incorporate the “Flat Rated” Thrust of the engine to allow 
determination of, for instance, the Climb Limit Take-off Weight.  Climb Limit Take-off Weight 
will increase with decreasing OAT, but only down to ISA + 15°C.  For each Pressure Altitude, an 
OAT lower than ISA + 15°C will not give an increase in Climb Limit Take-off Weight.
In the EASA Performance exam the ISA + 15°C temperature for each Pressure Altitude is referred 
to as the “kink” in the pressure altitude lines of CAP 698, Figures 4.4, 4.5 and 4.29.  “The kinks 
in the pressure altitude lines indicate the temperature, individually for each altitude, below 
which the Thrust will not increase with an increase in density”.

Figure 3.27 
Figure 3.27 shows Thrust Required (Aerodynamic Drag) and Thrust Available (from the engines) 
for an aeroplane powered by turbojet engines.
Excess Thrust is the amount of Thrust that exceeds aerodynamic Drag.  Excess Thrust can be 
seen on the graph as the distance between the Thrust Available and Thrust Required lines. You 
will recall that to maximize the climb gradient, Excess Thrust must be a maximum.  Maximum 
Excess Thrust is obtained by flying at the IAS where the distance between the Thrust and the 
Drag lines is maximum.
Notice that maximum Excess Thrust is available only at one particular IAS, labelled VX.  At any 
other speed, faster or slower, the distance between the Thrust and Drag curves is smaller and 
Excess Thrust is less. Therefore, climbing at an IAS other than VX will give a climb gradient less 
than the maximum possible.
The IAS at which the aeroplane generates the greatest amount of Excess Thrust and is therefore 
capable of its steepest climb gradient, is called VX.  (VX is referred to as the Best Angle of Climb 
Speed).  From Figure 3.27, it can be seen that for an aeroplane powered by turbojet engines, 
VX is the same IAS as VMD. VX for a propeller aeroplane is less than VMD and at low altitudes will 
be in the region of VMP.

Figure 3.28 
Figure 3.28 shows the result of increased weight on the steady climb.  More weight requires 
more Lift, therefore Induced Drag will be greater.  This moves the Total Drag curve up, but also 
to the right.  Thrust Required is increased and VX is a faster IAS.  Because Thrust Required has 
increased, Excess Thrust is decreased, so maximum climb gradient is decreased.
Remember the formula to calculate climb gradient?
Gradient %     =  (T - D)
W
× 100
Merely by looking at the above formula certain facts are self-evident:
•	 For a given Weight, the greater the “Excess Thrust” (T – D) the more times Weight will divide 
into the bigger value and therefore, the steeper the climb gradient.  The less the Excess 
Thrust the more shallow the climb gradient.
•	 For a given Excess Thrust (T – D), the greater the Weight the fewer times Weight will divide 
into the same value and therefore, the more shallow the climb gradient.  The less the weight 
the steeper the climb gradient.
Increased Weight reduces maximum climb gradient and increases VX.

The Effect of Flaps (or Gear)
Another factor that affects maximum climb angle is aircraft configuration.  Configuration 
means whether the flaps (or gear) are extended, or not.  If flaps (and gear) are retracted, the 
aircraft is said to be in the clean configuration.  If flaps (or gear) are extended, Parasite Drag 
will increase, but there will be no significant change in Induced Drag.

Figure 3.29 
Figure 3.29 shows a steady climb with flaps (or gear) extended compared to the clean 
configuration.  Parasite Area is increased, therefore Parasite Drag will be greater.  This moves 
the Total Drag curve up, but also to the left.  Thrust Required is increased and VX is a slower IAS. 
Because Thrust Required has increased, Excess Thrust is decreased, so maximum climb gradient 
is decreased.
Flaps or gear reduce maximum climb gradient and decrease VX.
It therefore seems a very good idea to retract the gear as soon as possible after lift-off, after 
a positive rate of climb is achieved, and also not to use flaps during a climb so that the climb 
angle is as large as possible.  But, you may recall the purpose of flaps is to decrease the take-off 
and landing run.  If it is necessary to use flaps for the take-off run, retract them in stages after 
take-off as soon as it is safe to do so.  The regulatory flap retraction schedule will be discussed 
later.

The Effect of Air Density
•	 Air density affects the mass flow of air into the engine.
•	 A decrease in air density reduces Thrust Available, thus Excess Thrust is also decreased.
Therefore, the ability to climb decreases with decreasing air density.
Air density is presented on performance graphs as two components:  Temperature and 
Pressure Altitude. (Pressure Altitude is the reading on the altimeter when 1013 hPa is set on 
the subscale).  Any variation in atmospheric pressure or temperature will change air density 
and therefore Excess Thrust.
Relevant aircraft performance graphs contain a horizontal axis of temperature and a series 
of sloping Pressure Altitude guide lines.  An intersection of these two values will provide the 
necessary compensation for Density Altitude.
Density Altitude
Now might be a good time to review the meaning of Density Altitude.  The “official” definition 
can be confusing: “A high Density Altitude is one that represents a higher altitude in the 
International Standard Atmosphere”.  A fair explanation when one already understands what 
is meant, but of little instructional value.  Air density cannot be “sensed” or measured directly, 
but it can be calculated.
Let us say that you are on an airfield which is physically at sea level; the waves are lapping 
at the end of the runway.  Due to existing meteorological conditions the air pressure is low 
(lower than Standard sea level atmospheric pressure of 1013 hPa), and with 1013 hPa set on the 
altimeter subscale the altimeter reads 1000 ft.
The reason the altimeter reads 1000 ft is because the actual air pressure is the same as that 
at 1000 ft in the International Standard Atmosphere - you are at “a high Pressure Altitude”. 
Reduced air pressure will give reduced air density (mass per unit volume).  But air density is also 
affected by temperature.  The “Standard” air temperature at 1000 ft is 13°C (Temperature lapse 
rate of 2°C per 1000 ft, so 15 - 2 = 13), yet for this example, the actual Outside Air Temperature 
is measured at 25°C.  The actual air temperature is 12°C higher than “Standard” (25 - 13 = 
12).  This is referred to as ISA+12.  Now, either a table or a circular slide rule can be used to 
accurately determine the Density Altitude; in this case: approximately 2400 ft.  So, although the 
aircraft is physically at sea level, the air density is the same as that at approximately 2400 ft in 
the International Standard Atmosphere.  A turbojet engine would theoretically generate less 
thrust and the TAS would need to be higher for a given IAS.
For take-off and initial climb from the same airfield, any increase in pressure altitude or air 
temperature due to local meteorological conditions will reduce Excess Thrust and therefore the 
ability to climb (or accelerate).  This is in addition to the more obvious decrease in air density 
during a climb to high altitude.

Figure 3.30 
Any decrease in air density (increase in Density Altitude) will reduce Thrust Available and 
therefore move the Thrust line downwards, as shown on the graph in Figure 3.30.
Because decreased density reduces Excess Thrust, maximum climb angle will be reduced. 
Excess Thrust will continually decrease with increasing Density Altitude so the maximum angle 
of climb will continually decrease as the aircraft climbs.  Note that VX will remain constant with 
changes in air density, because at a constant IAS (VX) Drag will not vary.  However, you will 
recall that as air density decreases, True Airspeed must be increased to maintain the required 
dynamic pressure.
So although the IAS for VX is constant with increasing Density Altitude, the TAS for VX will of 
course increase.
You may recall from earlier lessons that high humidity will also decrease air density and will 
therefore also decrease aeroplane performance.  This is already factored into performance 
charts, so is not something you need to allow for.  However, basic theory questions in the exam 
may require your knowledge of the fact.
The Effect of Accelerating on Climbing
It has been stated that the ability of an aircraft to climb depends upon Excess Thrust, which is 
the amount of Thrust Available remaining after Drag is balanced. Hence an aircraft’s maximum 
climb angle is limited by its maximum Excess Thrust.  If there is a need to accelerate the aircraft 
while climbing or a need to climb while accelerating, some of the Excess Thrust must be used 
for the acceleration and therefore the maximum climb angle will be reduced.

The Effect of Bank Angle on Climbing
When an aircraft is banked, any increase in bank angle beyond approximately 15 degrees 
will significantly increase the amount of Lift that needs to be generated.  Increased Lift will 
generate more Induced Drag, so Excess Thrust will be reduced and therefore maximum climb 
angle will be reduced.
The Effect of Wind on Climbing
The effect that wind has on climbing depends upon the type of climb gradient being considered, 
(wind being motion of a body of air over the ground).  There are two types of climb gradient: 
Air gradient and Ground gradient.  Air gradient is used by aviation authorities to lay down 
minimum climb performance limits.  E.g. a Class ‘A’ aeroplane: “….. starting at the point at 
which the aeroplane reaches 400 ft (122 m) above the take-off surface, the available gradient of 
climb may not be less than 1.2% for two-engined aeroplanes”.
Air Gradient
Air gradient is the vertical distance gained in a body of air divided by the horizontal distance 
travelled through the same body of air.  The fact that the body of air might be moving over the 
ground is NOT considered.  So wind has no effect on Air gradient.

the Air gradient is shown as Gamma ‘a’.
Note: To simplify the study of climbing, for climb angles less than approximately 20 degrees, it 
is considered that doubling the climb angle will double the climb gradient.

The only time wind is used to calculate climb gradient is when obstacle clearance is being 
considered.  In all other cases of climbing, still air is used, even if a wind value is supplied.

Applying 50% of the 20 kt headwind makes the ground speed (GS) 90 kt (100 – 10 = 90).
100 kt TAS divided by 90 kt GS gives a wind factor of 1.11.  Multiplying the Air gradient of 12% 
by the wind factor gives a Ground gradient of 13.32%.
Example 2:	
An Air gradient of 12% with a TAS of 160 kt and a headwind of 20 kt. 160

factor gives a Ground gradient of 12.8% (12 × 1.07 = 12.8).
Note: It is important to remember that if the Ground gradient is to be used for the calculation of 
obstacle clearance, the application of headwinds and tailwinds must include the 50% headwind 
and 150% tailwind rule.

100 kt TAS divided by 130 kt GS gives a wind factor of 0.77.  Multiplying the Air gradient of 12%

Multiplying the Air gradient of 12% by the wind factor gives a Ground gradient of 10.1% 
(12 × 0.84 = 10.1).
Having detailed the method of calculating Ground gradient from the Air gradient, we will now 
examine a typical climb gradient question.
Example 5:	
Determine the ground distance for a Class B aeroplane to reach a height of 
2000 ft above Reference Zero in the following conditions:
	
OAT: 25°C
	
Pressure altitude: 1000 ft
	
Gradient:  9.4%
	
Speed: 100 KIAS

The question mentions 2000 ft above Reference Zero; what is Reference Zero?
Reference Zero is the point on the runway or clearway plane at the end of the Take-off Distance 
Required (Figure 3.37). It is the reference point for locating the start point of the take-off Flight 
Path.

General Principles - Climb
A Class B aeroplane is being considered, so the screen height is 50 ft.  The climb segment begins 
at the screen height above Reference Zero.  Therefore the aeroplane will only need to gain an 
additional 1950 ft to be 2000 ft above Reference Zero.  A 10.15% gradient simply means that 
the aircraft will be 10.15 units higher after 100 units of horizontal travel.

Figure 3.40 
In this case the required vertical height gain is 1950 ft, so we need to discover how many times 
10.15 will divide into 1950 ft (1950 ft / 10.15 = 192.12).  This means that the vertical height gain 
is 192.12 times greater, so the horizontal distance will also be 192.12 times greater.  Multiplying 
100 by 192.12 will give the horizontal distance travelled in feet, in this case, 19 212 ft.
Example 6:	
Following take-off, a light twin-engine aeroplane has a 10% climb gradient.  By 
how much will it clear a 900 m high obstacle situated 9740 m from the end of the Take-off 
Distance Available (TODA)?

In order to find out by how much the aeroplane will clear the obstacle, it is necessary to calculate 
the height gain after covering a horizontal distance of 9740 m.
Remember:  Percentage gradient is merely the vertical height for a horizontal distance travelled 
of 100 units.  In this case the 10% gradient will give 10 units up for every 100 units along.
The primary data from the question has been included in Figure 3.41.  This simple procedure 
allows you to see how the aircraft flight path relates to the obstacle.  The height of the obstacle 
is above Reference Zero, as is the start of the climb segment.
For practical purposes a screen height of 50 ft is 15 m.

10 × 97.4 = 974 m
9740m   100 = 97.4
(50 f t) 15 m
900 m
Figure 3.42 
The distance of the obstacle from the end of the TODA is 9740 m, so we need to discover how 
many times the horizontal ratio of 100 will divide into that distance (9740 / 100 = 97.4).  This 
means that the horizontal distance is 97.4 times greater, so the height gain will also be 97.4 
times greater.  Multiplying 10 by 97.4 will give the height gain in metres,  (97.4 × 10 = 974 m) in 
this case, 974 m.
However, it must be remembered that the climb segment starts at 15 m (50 ft) above Reference 
Zero.  So the screen height must be added to the height gain (974 m + 15 m = 989 m), in this 
example, 989 m.
The aircraft will clear the 900 metre obstacle by 89 metres.
Rate of Climb
We will now consider rate of climb and begin with an overview. There are many ways of learning. 
But once a concept has been explained and understood it must then be remembered.  Some 
students manage to confuse angle of climb with rate of climb, so the following basic explanation 
is provided to help decide when and how to use rate of climb.  (The same considerations can be 
used later with rate of descent).
POWER is the RATE of doing work.  (Associate the word RATE with the word POWER).
Work  =  Force  ×  Distance
Therefore:
POWER  = 
Force    ×    Distance
Time
When considering rate of climb we need to do the maximum amount of work on the aeroplane 
in a given time.
Question:	
When climbing, what force must be balanced?
Answer:	
Drag!
The remaining product from the formula is distance divided by time, e.g. nautical miles per 
hour (kt).

Question:	
How many speeds are there?
Answer:	
One!  The True Airspeed, the only speed there is, the speed of the aeroplane 
through the air.
Therefore: 	
POWER  REQUIRED    =   DRAG  ×  TAS
If we take a Thrust Required (Drag) curve in sea level ISA conditions, and multiply the Drag at 
various airspeeds by the TAS and plot the resulting Power Required curve on the same piece of 
graph paper, the result will be that illustrated in Figure 3.43.

Figure 3.43 
The shape of the Power Required curve is very similar to that of Thrust Required.  The significant 
difference is that the Power Required curve is displaced to the left.  Consequently, the speed for 
minimum Power Required (VMP) is slower than the speed for minimum Thrust Required (VMD).
It is essential to be able to visualize the Power Required curve relative to the Thrust Required 
curve, together with the VMP and VMD relationship.  Associated data will be presented later.
To demonstrate one use of the (POWER REQUIRED = DRAG × TAS)  formula;  if an aircraft 
climbs at a constant IAS, Drag remains constant, but TAS must be increased to compensate for 
decreasing air density.  Therefore, when climbing at a constant IAS, Power Required increases.
Rate of climb is the vertical speed of an aeroplane measured in feet per minute; it is displayed 
in the cockpit on the vertical speed indicator (VSI).   
Another way to think of rate of climb is to consider it as the TAS of the aeroplane along a 
gradient.

Figure 3.44 shows two identical aeroplanes at the same angle of climb.  The one on the right 
has a higher TAS along the gradient.  In the same time, the aeroplane on the right will climb 
through a greater vertical distance than the aeroplane on the left.  Therefore the aeroplane on 
the right has a higher rate of climb.  This demonstrates that TAS is one important factor when 
considering rate of climb.
Figure 3.44 
Figure 3.45 shows two identical aeroplanes at the same TAS.  The aeroplane on the right is 
climbing at a steeper angle.  In the same time, the aeroplane on the right climbs through a 
greater vertical distance than the aeroplane on the left.  Therefore the aeroplane on the right 
has a higher rate of climb. This demonstrates that angle of climb is also an important factor in 
the rate of climb.
Figure 3.45 
From Figure 3.44 and Figure 3.45 and the above explanation, it can be seen that rate of climb 
is a function of both angle of climb and TAS along the achieved gradient.

Sample Question
	
An aircraft with a gradient of 3.3% is flying at an IAS of 85 kt.  At a Pressure 
Altitude of 8500 ft and an outside air temperature 15°C, the aircraft will have an 
ROC of:
a.	
284 ft/min
b.	
623 ft/min
c.	
1117 ft/min
d.	
334 ft/min
As Power Required is Drag × TAS, the IAS must be converted into TAS at the pressure altitude 
of 8500 ft and an OAT of 15 degrees C.  Using a circular slide rule the TAS is 100 KTAS.
Note: At climb angles less than approximately 20 degrees (and they always will be) the difference 
in length between the hypotenuse and the adjacent sides of a right angled triangle is so small 
that, for the sake of simplicity, it is disregarded in this type of calculation.  So we do not need 
to worry about the fact that the aeroplane TAS is ‘up’ the hypotenuse.  (EASA make the same 
assumption, so your answers will be correct)
From our previous study of climb angle/gradient it is self-evident that use of percentage 
gradient allows us to visualize the ratio of ‘up’ to ‘along’.  In this case the climb gradient of 
3.3% gives a horizontal component of 100 and a vertical component of 3.3.  Because we are 
considering RATE of climb, the horizontal component is the TAS, which in this case is 100 KTAS; 
this must be converted into ft/min:
	
	
	
	
100 KTAS × 6080 ft
60 mins
= 10 133 ft/min
	
	
	
	
10 133 ft/min
100
= 101.33
	
	
	
	
101.33  ×  3.3   =   334 ft/min
Let us return to the formula for the gradient of climb as shown below:
	
	
	
	
(T - D)
W
Gradient =
Gradient is given by the formula Thrust Available minus Thrust Required divided by Weight.  All 
that it is needed now for consideration of rate of climb is to add the velocity function, as shown 
below.  This is now the formula for rate of climb.
	
	
	
	
(T - D)
W
Rate of Climb =
× TAS
However, there is a little more detail to understand:
The velocity is True Airspeed, but Thrust and Drag are both forces and TAS is distance over 
time. Force multiplied by distance gives work and work divided by time gives power.  This 
means that instead of Thrust multiplied by velocity, the formula now contains the expression 
Power Available, and instead of Thrust Required multiplied by velocity, the formula now has 
Power Required.

Rate of Climb = 
(Excess Power Available)
Power Available - Power Required
W
The rate of climb formula now reads Power Available minus Power Required (Excess Power 
Available), divided by Weight.  
For any given Weight, the greater the Excess Power Available, the greater the rate of climb. 
Conversely, the less the Excess Power Available, the smaller the rate of climb.  In order to 
maximize the aeroplane’s rate of climb therefore, we need to maximize Excess Power.  To 
understand how it is possible to obtain the greatest amount of Excess Power Available and 
therefore climb at the highest rate of climb it is necessary to look at some more graphs.
Excess Power Available (Jet)
Figure 3.46 shows a graph of Power Available and Power Required for a typical jet aeroplane. 
In order to provide some benchmarks it is necessary to locate the two reference speeds VMP and 
VMD that we mentioned earlier. The speed found at the bottom of the Power Required curve 
is called the velocity for minimum power or VMP.  There was another speed, slightly faster than 
VMP called VMD.  This speed is the velocity for minimum drag and is found at the point of contact 
of the tangent from the origin to the Power Required curve. 
Having analysed the reference speeds, the object now is to locate where Excess Power available 
is maximum.  
Figure 3.46 Maximum Excess Power available occurs at a speed faster than VMD 
for jet aeroplanes
Looking at the graph, the area between the two curves represents the area of Excess Power 
available.  On the graph the greatest amount of Excess Power available will be found where 
the distance between the curves is at its maximum.  Notice that it occurs at a speed higher than 
VMD.  At any other speed, the Excess Power is less and the rate of climb will be less.  The speed 
for the best rate of climb is called VY.  Therefore for a jet aeroplane VY occurs at a speed higher 
than VMD.  VY is the airspeed to use to climb to the cruise or en route altitude as it will give the 
greatest height gain per unit time.  In a typical 737-400 this speed is about 275 knots and is 
usually published in the aeroplane flight manual as an indicated airspeed.

Excess Power Available (Propeller)
Figure 3.47 is a graph of Power Available and Power Required for a typical propeller aeroplane. 
On the graph, the greatest amount of Excess Power available will be found where the distance 
between the curves is at its maximum. 
Figure 3.47 Maximum Excess Power available occurs at a speed higher than VMP  for 
propeller aeroplanes.
Notice that for a propeller aeroplane this occurs at a speed higher than VMP.  At any other 
speed, the Excess Power is less and the rate of climb less.  As we have already learnt, VY is the 
speed for the best rate of climb.  Therefore for a propeller aeroplane VY occurs at a speed 
higher than VMP.
It is important to remember where VY is found for both jet and propeller aeroplanes.  For 
example, looking at Figure 3.47, it can be seen that if a propeller aeroplane were climbing at a 
speed equal to VMP and then selected a slightly higher speed, the Excess Power would increase 
and the rate of climb would increase.  It is more obvious to see how speed changes affect both 
Excess Power and the rate of climb when the graph is used.  Try and become aware of what 
the graphs look like so that you can use them to your advantage in test situations. Let us now 
examine what factors can influence the rate of climb for jet and propeller aeroplanes.
Factors Affecting Rate of Climb
Weight
You may recall that an increase in Weight creates more weight apparent Drag which reduces 
the angle of climb.  For any given airspeed, if the angle of climb reduces, then so will the rate 
of climb because they are fundamentally linked.  You can see this effect on the formula shown 
below.  Simply by increasing the value of Weight, mathematically the rate of climb will reduce.
	
	
Rate of Climb = Power Available - Power Required
W
Weight has a further effect that we have already talked about.  An increase in Weight will 
require an increase in Lift.  Increasing Lift increases Induced Drag which causes the Drag curve 
to move up and right.  The Power Required curve, shown in red in the following graph, is 
actually based upon Drag.  Power Required is Drag multiplied by velocity.
--- Page 207 ---
3
77
    General Principles - Climb
3
General Principles - Climb
So if the Drag curve moves up and right, so will the Power Required curve.
Figure 3.48  The effect of higher Weight is to move the Power Required 
curve up & right, reducing Excess Thrust & increasing VY.
Figure 3.49 The effect of higher Weight is to move the Power Required curve 
up & right, reducing Excess Thrust & increasing VY.
As you can see from Figure 3.48 for jet aeroplanes and Figure 3.49 for propeller aeroplanes 
the power required curve moves up and right.  Therefore, less Excess Power is available and 
therefore the rate of climb decreases.  However, what is important to see is that the speed 
for maximum Excess Power available is no longer the same.  It is now higher.  So with higher 
Weight, the rate of climb is decreased but VY is increased.
--- Page 208 ---
General Principles - Climb

General Principles - Climb
Configuration
The next factor that affects the rate of climb is the configuration of the aircraft, in other 
words the use of flaps and gear.  
If the gear and flaps are deployed then the profile drag of the aeroplane will increase.  This 
increases total Drag and the Drag curve moves upwards and to the left.  
The Power Required curves will follow the same movement as the Drag curve. 
Figure 3.50 The effect of extending the gear or flaps is to move the Power Required curve up & left, reducing 
Excess Thrust & decreasing VY.
Notice the reduction in Excess Power available as shown by the blue double headed arrows. 
You may recall that a reduction in Excess Power reduces your rate of climb. 
However, the important effect here is that the speed for maximum Excess Power is no longer 
the same.  It is now lower.  So with the gear and/or flaps deployed, the rate of climb is 
decreased and VY is decreased.  If you use flaps for take off, remove them in stages when you 
have attained a positive stable climb ensuring you check through the aeroplane flight manual 
for the correct actions for your aeroplane.
As you do so, the rate of climb and the speed to attain the best rate of climb will increase, so 
you should accelerate to ensure you remain at VY.
Density
Density is another important factor that affects the rate of climb.  However, density affects a 
lot of the variables in the formula for the rate of climb.
Shown below is an expanded rate of climb formula, reminding you that Power Available is 
Thrust multiplied by true airspeed and that Power Required is Drag multiplied by true airspeed. 
Rate of Climb  =  Power Available (Thrust × TAS) - Power Required (Drag × TAS)
W
Focusing on the Power Available for the moment, decreased density will decrease the Thrust 
but it will also increase the true airspeed.  The overall effect is that the Thrust loss is more than 
the TAS gain, meaning, overall, that the Power Available decreases.
Looking at Power Required, decreased density will increase the true airspeed but have no 
effect on the Drag.  Therefore the Power Required will increase.
--- Page 209 ---

79
    General Principles - Climb

General Principles - Climb
Looking at Figure 3.51 and using the graphs for the jet and propeller aeroplanes you can see 
that the Power Available curves move down and right, and the Power Required curves move 
up and right. You will notice that there is less Excess Power available and this causes a reduction 
in the rate of climb for both aeroplane types.  
Figure 3.51 Decreasing density (high temperature/high altitudes/high humidity) reduces Excess Power available and 
increases VY (TAS).
Notice from the graphs that the true airspeed for VY increases a little with decreasing density 
or increasing altitude.  However, as pilots we fly using indicated airspeeds and therefore it is 
important to understand what happens to the indicated airspeed of VY.  In order that we may 
understand this, a further explanation is needed.
Using Figure 3.52 you will notice that if the true airspeed increases only slightly with altitude, 
then the indicated airspeed will still fall.  Therefore, although VY as TAS increases with decreasing 
density or increasing altitude, VY as an IAS decreases.  In fact, VY will eventually fall to become 
the same value as VX.  So in summary, reduced density decreases the indicated airspeed of VY 
and decreases the rate of climb.
Figure 3.52 If the TAS of VY increases a little with 
reducing density or increasing altitude, the IAS of VY 
still falls.
--- Page 210 ---

General Principles - Climb
In relation to altitude, as the aeroplane flies higher, the Excess Power available diminishes and 
therefore the maximum achievable rate of climb will decrease.
There will be an altitude where the Excess Power available decreases to zero, as shown in 
Figure 3.53. Therefore the rate of climb will also decrease to zero.  This altitude is known as the 
absolute ceiling. 
Figure 3.53 At a certain altitude or density, there is no more Excess Power 
 available & therefore the rate of climb is zero
Figure 3.54 shows the excess of power for a typical aeroplane at various altitudes.  Notice VY 
is the speed that gives the maximum Excess Power available and maximum achievable rate 
of climb.  This is shown by the top of each curve.  Also note that on this graph, VX can be 
found where the tangent out of the origin touches each curve.  As altitude increases, notice 
that the Excess Power available, achievable rate of climb and the indicated airspeed for VY 
decreases.   Eventually there will be an altitude where VX and VY are the same and there is no 
more Excess Power and, therefore, the rate of climb is zero.  Remember that this altitude is 
called the absolute ceiling.  
Figure 3.54 As altitude increases, the Excess Thrust reduces and VY as an IAS decreases 
to become the same speed as VX at the absolute ceiling.
At its absolute ceiling, the performance of an aeroplane is so reduced that it is unable to 
manoeuvre.  Therefore, absolute ceiling is a rather abstract concept for a pilot.  It is more 
useful for a pilot to know his aeroplane’s service ceiling.  Service ceiling is defined by the
--- Page 211 ---

81
    General Principles - Climb
3
General Principles - Climb
manufacturers and aviation authorities as the maximum altitude where the best rate of climb 
airspeed will still produce a positive rate of climb at a specific number of feet per minute. 
The recommendation is to not exceed this altitude because the performance envelope of the 
aeroplane is very small.  If the aeroplane were to climb higher, the rate of climb would fall to 
zero, the aeroplane would not be able to climb any higher and the absolute ceiling would 
be reached.   At this altitude VY and VX are the same speed. To find the absolute and service 
ceilings of your aeroplane, consult your flight manual and operate the aeroplane below the 
service ceiling to help maintain sufficient performance levels.   
Wind
Wind is generally considered as horizontal movement of air.  It cannot oppose or add to the 
vertical forces on the aeroplane.  As such, wind has no effect on the rate of climb and therefore 
has no effect on the time to climb.  However, vertical wind currents such as the ones found in 
microbursts or vertical windshear do affect the rate of climb of the aeroplane.

General Principles - Descent
Descent
Descent performance will focus mainly on the forces in the descent and what factors govern 
the descent.  In a normal flight, the descent will occur at a point we define as “the top of 
descent” which may be up to 200 miles before the destination aerodrome.  A descent will also 
be required following engine failure or depressurization.  In this latter situation the descent is 
forced early and it is important for the pilot to be aware of what determines the characteristics 
of the descent so that obstacle clearance can be maintained.  There are two ways of measuring 
the descent performance of an aircraft.  Either by angle of descent, (sometimes called descent 
range) or rate of descent, (sometimes called descent endurance).
Angle of Descent
In order to initiate a steady descent, thrust is normally reduced.  The forward force of thrust 
in now less than the rearward force of drag and the aircraft slows down.  The value of drag 
that exceeds the thrust force is called excess drag.  In order to balance the forces and maintain 
speed, the nose is lowered until the weight apparent thrust provides enough forward force 
to balance the excess of drag as can be seen in Figure 4.1.  Now the aircraft will maintain this 
steady descent angle at a constant speed.  The forward and rearward forces are in balance 
once again.  Drag (DA) is being balanced by the thrust (T) and the weight apparent thrust (W 
sin γ).
DA = T + W sin γ
Figure 4.1 An illustration showing the balance of forces in normal powered descent
--- Page 224 ---
General Principles - Descent

General Principles - Descent
The weight apparent thrust can be calculated by multiplying weight by the sine of the angle 
gamma. If thrust were reduced even more as shown in Figure 4.2, then there would be a 
greater amount of excess drag. More weight apparent thrust is therefore needed to balance 
the greater amount of excess drag.  To gain more weight apparent thrust the aeroplane nose 
must be lowered even more.  The result is an increase in the descent angle.  For the purpose of 
the examinations, lowering the nose is a decrease in pitch.
Figure 4.2 An illustration showing the balance of forces in low powered descent
From this demonstration it is clear that it is the excess drag which determines the angle of 
descent. Notice that the angle gamma is the same angle as the angle of descent.  
Rearranging the formula shown in Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2 (DA = T + W sin γ) so that angle 
gamma can be calculated gives us the formula for the angle or gradient of descent.
Gradient of Descent (%)    = (D - T)
W
× 100
Drag minus thrust will give excess drag.  In summary then, the angle or gradient of descent is 
controlled by the excess drag.  In order to visualize this excess drag, it is necessary to return to 
the thrust and drag graphs that were used in the climbing lesson.

Figure 4.3 An illustration showing excess drag (D-T) for a jet & propeller aeroplane
Shown in Figure 4.3 are the thrust and drag curves for a jet and propeller aeroplane.  We have 
learnt that in order to descend, there has to be an excess of drag.  On the graphs, excess drag 
can be found by taking the area beneath the drag curve and subtracting from it the area 
beneath the thrust curve.  The solid purple highlighted areas represent excess drag.  Notice 
that if thrust is reduced at any given speed, then excess drag increases, therefore the descent 
angle increases. 
Maximum Angle of Descent
If it were a performance priority to maximize the angle of descent, then from the theory we 
have seen so far, we would have to maximize excess drag.  
Figure 4.4 An illustration showing excess drag (D-T) for 
a jet & propeller aeroplane with zero thrust
If thrust is reduced to zero, notice that the excess drag area is a maximum, but to obtain the 
maximum excess drag, the aeroplane needs to be accelerated to a very high speed, as shown 
in Figure 4.4. This can be achieved by closing the throttles, and continuously lowering the nose 
of the aeroplane so as to cause the increasing amount of weight apparent thrust to accelerate 
the aeroplane.  As speed rises even more, both the excess drag and the angle of descent will 
increase.  The angle of descent, then, is a function of excess drag; the greater the excess drag 
the steeper the angle of descent.  This angle could be increased even more if it were possible 
to increase the excess drag.  This can be achieved by deploying drag devices such as the speed 
brakes and the undercarriage, but attention must be paid to their maximum deployment 
speeds. The practical side of increasing drag to increase your descent angle occurs mainly in 
training and occasionally in commercial operations after air traffic re-routes.  Take note that 
any increase in excess drag either by deploying speed brakes or undercarriage, or by reducing 
thrust will steepen the angle of descent.

General Principles - Descent
Minimum Angle of Descent
You have just learnt that to maximize the descent angle excess drag must be maximized. 
Following an engine failure the aim is to ensure that the aeroplane will cover the greatest 
horizontal distance so that the pilot has a large area in which to select a suitable landing field. 
This can only be achieved by using the smallest possible angle of descent sometimes referred 
to as the minimum glide angle.  To descend at the smallest possible angle, excess drag must be 
minimum.  This can be seen in Figure 4.5.
Figure 4.5 An illustration showing that excess drag (D-
T) is minimum at VMD for a jet & propeller aeroplane 
with zero thrust
Notice that VMD is the speed found at the bottom of the drag curve.  At VMD, drag is at a 
minimum.  Therefore, to descend at the minimum possible angle, the aeroplane must be flown 
at VMD since, with no power, VMD is the speed that gives minimum excess drag.
One of the other ways to examine glide performance is to consider the aeroplane’s lift over 
drag ratio commonly referred to as the lift drag ratio. However, before we do this, there is a 
little more detail to discuss first. In the glide descent the resultant of drag and lift balances the 
force of weight.  From your Principles of Flight lessons, the term for the resultant of lift and 
drag is total reaction.  If the drag force line is moved upwards you can see that we now have a 
triangle of forces with the angle gamma being the angle between the lift and total reaction.
Figure 4.6 The value of drag (in red) & the value of lift (in yellow) determine the angle 
gamma, which is also the same as the angle of descent
Looking at Figure 4.6, if there were any change in the lift and/or drag values, both the angle 
gamma and the glide angle would change.  A typical modern jet has a maximum lift drag ratio 
of about 19.  Where this ratio reaches its maximum, the value of the angle gamma will be at
--- Page 227 ---

97
       General Principles - Descent

General Principles - Descent
its minimum.  The lift drag ratio reaches its maximum value at 4 degrees angle of attack and 
is always at the speed VMD.  Therefore, VMD is the speed for the minimum angle of descent or 
the minimum glide angle.  VMD is also known as the speed for L/D Max.  The angle of attack at 
VMD is fixed at 4 degrees.  If the angle of attack is greater or less than 4 degrees, the speed will 
change, the lift drag ratio will decrease in value and consequently the angle of the glide will 
increase.
If, following an engine failure, you fly at VMD, your aeroplane will be flying at the smallest 
possible glide angle.  Never try to stretch the glide by raising the nose of the aeroplane.  If you 
do so, the speed will decrease and the glide angle will steepen.  At any speed other than VMD 
your glide angle will be steeper than the optimal glide angle.
Shown in Figure 4.7 is the angle of glide at VMD.
Figure 4.7 When flying at VMD, if the nose is raised the aeroplane will slow down & 
therefore not be at VMD anymore. The angle of descent will therefore steepen
The temptation is to raise the nose a little.  This gives an impression from the cockpit that the 
glide is being extended.  If the nose were raised, the weight apparent thrust would decrease 
and the aeroplane would slow down.  As a result the aeroplane would not be flying at VMD, and 
therefore not have the best lift drag ratio.  The result would be a steeper descent angle despite 
the fact that the aeroplane had a slightly higher nose attitude.  Be disciplined in following the 
procedures for flying at the optimum glide angle as laid down by the manufacturer or the 
operator in the aeroplane flight manual.
Rate of Descent
You may recall we mentioned at the beginning of the descent section that there were two 
ways of assessing the descent performance.  We have covered the angle of descent or descent 
range; now let us consider the rate of descent or descent endurance.
You have already learnt in an earlier lesson that the rate of climb is a function of both climb 
angle and velocity.  Similarly, the rate of descent is a function of descent angle and velocity. 
Shown below is the formula for the rate of descent.  
Rate of  Descent  = DV - TV
W
You may recall that force and velocity gave us Power.  So the correct formula for the rate of 
descent is shown below.
Rate of  Descent  =
(Excess Power Required)
  Power Required -  Power Available
	
	
W
--- Page 228 ---
General Principles - Descent

98
4
General Principles - Descent
The rate of descent is equal to the power required minus the power available divided by the 
weight.  Power required minus power available gives excess power required.  So, for any given 
weight, the rate of descent is determined by the excess power required.  
The greater the excess power required, the larger the achievable rate of descent, conversely 
the lesser the excess power required the smaller will be the rate of descent.
In an emergency descent, for instance a descent initiated by the pilot following depressurization, 
the aim is to reach FL100 as soon as possible.  To achieve this requirement, the aeroplane would 
need to lose height with the maximum possible rate of descent which can only happen if the 
aeroplane has maximum excess power required.  Shown in Figure 4.8 is the power required and 
power available curves for both the jet and propeller aeroplane.  The areas beneath the power 
required curves but above the power available curves represent the excess power required and 
are highlighted in purple.  However, notice that there is not very much excess power required, 
but it is possible to generate more. 
Figure 4.8 The area beneath the power required line but above the power available line represents the area for 
excess power required. This is shown by the purple shaded areas
In order to create the conditions of the greatest 
excess of power required, power available 
(represented by the green lines in the previous 
diagram) must be reduced to zero as shown by 
Figure 4.9. 
Notice that the purple areas of excess power 
required, are now as large as possible.  In 
order to achieve the greatest rate of descent 
the aeroplane needs to fly at a speed that 
achieves the greatest excess power required.  It 
is obvious from the graph that this can only be 
achieved at very high speeds.   Remember that 
power required is a function of speed and drag, 
therefore the aeroplane needs to be configured 
for high drag and high speed in order to achieve 
maximum power required.  In fact, for a lot of 
Figure 4.9  With no power available since the throttle 
is closed, all of the area beneath the power required 
curve becomes excess power required

General Principles - Descent
Class A aeroplanes, emergency descents are flown at maximum operating speeds with speed 
brakes deployed and thrust at idle.
If it were the aim to descend at the lowest rate of descent, the aeroplane would need to fly at 
a speed that gives the minimum excess power required.  Looking at Figure 4.9 this point is plain 
to see.  In fact it is found at the very bottom of the power required curve.  You may recall that 
this speed is called VMP.  So, to lose height at the slowest possible rate of descent the aeroplane 
would need to fly at VMP.  The lowest rate of descent is also known as maximum descent 
endurance, which essentially means the aeroplane will take the greatest time to descend. 
EASA sometimes refer to this as the speed for maximum glide endurance.
Factors Affecting Descent
Weight
For the effect of weight on the descent we shall only consider the effect in a glide, in other 
words with idle power.  Let us firstly concentrate on the minimum angle of descent or the glide 
angle.
Figure 4.10 An illustration showing that with a higher 
weight the forward & rearward forces along the 
flight path are larger but the angle of glide remains 
unchanged
Looking at Figure 4.10 you can see that an aeroplane with a higher weight will have a larger 
amount of weight apparent thrust, but if the aeroplane is still flying at VMD, (which will be 
faster with a higher weight) it will also have a greater amount of drag.  You will recall this 
from knowing that a higher weight moves the drag curve up and right.  In Figure 4.10 you will 
notice that the forward and rearward forces along the flight path are still balanced, albeit a 
bit longer.  But crucially notice that the angle of descent is unchanged.  It is important for you 
to understand that weight has no effect on the minimum angle of descent or glide angle but 
it will increase the speed of the descent. 
In summary therefore, weight has no effect on the minimum angle of descent, but it will increase 
the speed along that descent gradient and therefore it will increase the rate of descent.

General Principles - Descent
Configuration
The next factor to affect the angle and rate of descent is the aeroplane’s configuration.   As 
with the effect of weight, configuration changes are best understood when assuming idle 
thrust.  Looking at Figure 4.11, if the flaps or undercarriage were deployed, then notice that 
excess drag increases.  To balance this increase in excess drag, the nose is lowered.  This action 
increases weight apparent thrust and a balance of forces is restored but, importantly the 
balance is achieved at a higher angle of descent and therefore a higher rate of descent.
Figure 4.11 An illustration showing an increase in excess drag must be balanced by an increase in weight apparent 
thrust
The effect of configuration can also be seen using graphs.  Shown below in Figure 4.12 is the 
drag curve for the jet and propeller aeroplane with excess drag shown by the purple area. 
With flaps and undercarriage deployed, you will recall that the curves move up and left.  This 
has the effect of increasing the excess drag and therefore increasing the angle of descent for 
any given speed.  Notice too that the speed for the minimum angle of descent, VMD, is lower.
Figure 4.12 With gear & flaps deployed, the drag curve 
moves up & left showing an increase in excess drag & 
consequently an increase in glide angle
--- Page 231 ---

The same effect can be seen in Figure 4.13 when examining the rate of descent and by using 
the power required graph.  Similarly the purple area represents excess power required.  
Figure 4.13 With gear & flaps deployed, the power 
required curve moves up & left showing an increase in 
excess power required & consequently an increase in 
the rate of descent
With flaps and gear deployed, you will recall that the power curves move up and left.  This has 
the effect of increasing the excess power required and therefore increasing the rate of descent. 
Notice too that the speed for the minimum rate of descent, VMP, is lower.
In summary then, with gear and flaps deployed the angle and rate of descent increase, but the 
speeds for minimum angle and minimum rate of descent decrease.
Wind
Figure 4.14 shows the effect of headwinds and tailwinds on the angle of descent. Headwinds 
steepen the glide angle and decrease the descent range whereas tailwinds decrease the glide 
angle but increase the descent range.  However, notice that the aeroplane in a headwind or 
tailwind reaches the same descent altitude in the same time as the aeroplane flying in zero 
wind conditions.  This demonstrates that a headwind or tailwind has no effect on the rate of 
descent.

rate of descent

The effect of the wind on the angle of descent can be examined a little further.  Because of 
the adverse effect of the headwind on descent range, then in a glide, it would be of benefit to 
increase the aeroplane’s forward speed slightly.  This has the effect of reducing the time spent 
in the headwind.  This means that the aeroplane will not be pushed back as much by the wind. 
Similarly with a tailwind; because a tailwind benefits the glide by increasing the descent range, 
it would be better to try and stay in this situation for longer.  So this time the aeroplane’s 
forward speed can be decreased so that the aeroplane can stay under the tailwind effect for 
longer and therefore be pushed further forwards.
When flying on a training sortie, make sure you know the wind speed and direction both for 
the surface and aloft.  This will help you plan a better descent giving you more accurate circuit 
patterns.  But more importantly, knowledge of what the wind is doing will ensure you obtain 
maximum descent performance if an engine failure should occur.

Balance of Forces in Level Flight
This chapter will concentrate on the general performance principles of an aeroplane in the en 
route phase of flight.  Performance in the en route phase can be measured using the aeroplane’s 
range and endurance parameters.  These will be discussed in detail later on in the chapter. Let 
us firstly examine the forces acting on an aircraft in the cruise.
These forces are split into couples and are shown in Figure 5.1.  
Figure 5.1 An illustration showing some of the forces in straight & level flight
The first of these couples is produced by lift and weight.  Weight acts through the centre of 
gravity of the aeroplane directly towards the centre of the earth.  Lift balances weight and 
acts through the centre of pressure.  The effect of this couple on the aeroplane is to cause 
a nose-down pitching moment. The lift/weight couple is comparatively strong and thus the 
nose-down pitching moment is large as shown by the large arrow pointing downwards to 
the right of the aeroplane.  As an example of the size of these forces, in a 737-800 series, 
the maximum structural mass is 79 000 kg.  At this mass the aeroplane weighs about 770 000 
Newtons.  Obviously this weight will be balanced in cruising flight by an equal and opposite lift 
force of 770 000 Newtons.
The second couple acting upon an aeroplane in flight is that produced by the forces of thrust 
and drag.  The effect of this couple is to cause a nose-up pitching moment as shown by the 
upward pointing red and green arrow to the right of the aeroplane.  Notice though that 
this couple is far weaker than the lift/weight couple.  The maximum thrust produced by the 
engines of a 737-800 is only 214 000 Newtons.  This means that the nose-up pitching moment 
generated by the thrust/drag couple does not balance the stronger nose-down pitching 
moment of the lift/weight couple. As a result there is still a nose-down tendency as shown 
in Figure 5.1.  In order to maintain level flight, we need somehow to generate an opposite 
moment which will balance the residual nose-down pitching tendency.  This is achieved by the 
tailplane, or horizontal stabilizer, on the aeroplane’s tail assembly.  The horizontal stabilizer, or 
tailplane, must be set at an angle which will cause a nose-up pitching moment to balance the 
aeroplane, or more commonly expressed, to trim the aeroplane.  Looking at Figure 5.2, notice 
that now, with the addition of the tailplane down force, the nose-up and nose-down pitching 
moments are in balance and level flight is possible.  The down force generated at the tail is 
called tailplane down force or tail load.

General Principles - Cruise
Figure 5.2 An illustration showing the complete balance forces in straight & level flight
Although such a force is necessary for level flight it does have two adverse effects on aircraft 
performance.  Firstly, notice that the tailplane down force acts in the same direction as weight. 
It therefore increases the effective weight of the aircraft.  The second adverse effect of the 
tailplane down force is its contribution to drag.  The tailplane is an aerodynamic surface designed 
to produce lift.  It will therefore produce induced drag as well as parasite drag.  Therefore, the 
greater the amount of balancing force produced by the tailplane the greater the aeroplane 
aerodynamic drag and effective weight.  We will shortly understand that the two additional 
forces provided by the tailplane are detrimental to the aeroplane’s en route performance in 
terms of range and endurance.
Moving the Centre of Gravity
To some extent the amount of tailplane down force required for level flight can be manipulated 
by moving the centre of gravity.  In flight this can be done in one of two ways.  Firstly by 
selective fuel consumption, or secondly by fuel transfer.  Consuming fuel in the tail first, or 
transferring fuel out of the tail to other tanks, will move the centre of gravity position forwards. 
Conversely, using fuel in the centre or forward tanks first, or transferring fuel out of these 
tanks will cause the centre of gravity to move aft.  If the centre of gravity moves forwards, the 
magnitude of the lift/weight couple increases because the arm of the two forces is now longer. 
The greater strength from the lift/weight couple increases the nose-down pitching moment. 
This can be seen by comparing the length of the lift/weight pitching down arrows from Figure 
5.2 and Figure 5.3.

General Principles - Cruise
Figure 5.3  An illustration showing that with a more forward C of G the lift/weight couple increases & greater tail 
load is needed
To balance the greater nose-down pitching moment and maintain level flight, more tailplane 
down force is needed.  You may recall that this had the effect of increasing the effective 
weight and the drag of the aeroplane which would have a detrimental effect on the aircraft’s 
performance, reducing both its range and endurance.  If the centre of gravity moves aft, 
the strength of the lift/weight couple is decreased because the arm of the two forces is now 
shorter.  This decreases the nose-down pitching moment.  To balance the nose-down pitching 
moment, less tailplane down force is needed to maintain level flight.  Reducing tailplane 
down force reduces drag and effective weight which will increase both the aeroplane’s range 
and endurance capability.  Remember that, before you fly, when carrying out a weight and 
balance check, also ensure that the centre of gravity is still within the limits published in the 
aircraft manual.  Be extra careful when handling data produced by countries whose units of 
measurement are different to those you are used to.
Aeroplane Speeds
This particular section of the chapter will deal with the aeroplane’s speed, including maximum 
speed, minimum speed, and the relationship between the various expressions of speed such as 
indicated airspeed, calibrated airspeed, true airspeed, true ground speed and Mach number. 
Firstly let us examine what we mean by an aeroplane’s maximum speed.  You will have learnt 
from earlier chapters that an aeroplane will remain at a constant speed when the forward and 
rearward forces are balanced, as shown in Figure 5.4.
--- Page 242 ---
General Principles - Cruise
5
112
5
General Principles - Cruise
Figure 5.4 In straight & level flight a constant speed is maintained when the forward force of thrust balances the 
rearward force of drag
In this case, thrust is equal to drag.  In order for the aeroplane to accelerate, thrust must exceed 
drag.  This can be achieved by the pilot opening the throttle further.  With thrust greater than 
drag the aeroplane will accelerate.  As the aeroplane accelerates, drag will increase.  When 
drag reaches a value which is the same as the thrust, acceleration will cease and the aeroplane 
will have achieved balanced flight once more, but now at a higher speed.  Therefore, the 
highest level flight speed that can be flown by the aeroplane will be at a speed where thrust is 
maximum and drag is maximum.  Let us look at what we have just learnt but this time using a 
graph.  Shown in Figure 5.5 are the thrust and drag curves for a typical jet aeroplane.  
Figure 5.5 An illustration showing that the intersections of the thrust & drag curves represent the maximum & 
minimum straight & level flight speeds
Notice the maximum speed is achieved once thrust and drag are equal.  It is impossible in 
straight and level flight to accelerate any faster since the drag would exceed the thrust.  This 
speed is the fastest speed the aeroplane can achieve in level flight.
--- Page 243 ---

General Principles - Cruise
Look at the graph again and notice that there is another point on the curves where thrust and 
drag are equal.  This point lies to the very left of the graph.  The speed at this point represents 
the slowest speed that can be maintained.   In level flight it would be impossible to fly any 
slower at this thrust setting since the rearward force of drag would exceed the force of thrust. 
 At high altitude the thrust produced by the engine decreases and therefore the green thrust 
line moves downwards.  
Figure 5.6 An illustration showing that at high altitudes, the level flight speed range decreases
Looking at Figure 5.6 it is clear to see that at high altitude the maximum achievable level flight 
speed is slower and the minimum achievable level flight speed is faster than at lower altitudes, 
thus the range of speeds for the aeroplane is narrower.
This next part of the chapter will focus on the explanation of the various expressions of 
aeroplane speed.  
Indicated Airspeed (IAS)
Different expressions of aeroplane speed are used for different purposes depending on whether 
we are concerned with aerodynamics, operations, navigation or even performance.  In most 
cases aeroplane speed is measured using certain types of probes called the total pressure and 
static pressure probes.  These probes help us to isolate dynamic pressure on which indicated 
airspeed is based.  You can feel total pressure by simply putting your arm out of the window of 
a moving car.  However, total pressure probes, sometimes called pitot probes, and static probes, 
suffer from errors.  Without any correction to the errors, the speed which is obtained from the 
probes when dynamic pressure is being sensed is called the indicated airspeed, abbreviated to 
IAS.  Indicated airspeed is the speed that is displayed on the airspeed indicator.  
Calibrated Airspeed (CAS)
If the pressure probes are corrected for instrument and position errors, the speed is called 
calibrated airspeed, abbreviated to CAS.  This speed is also known as rectified airspeed, or 
RAS but this expression will not be used in this book.  Calibrated airspeed is more accurate
--- Page 244 ---
General Principles - Cruise

General Principles - Cruise
than indicated airspeed.  In large modern commercial aeroplanes, the air data computer 
automatically corrects the pressure probe data for these errors and displays the calibrated 
airspeed in the airspeed indicator rather than the indicated airspeed.  
Equivalent Airspeed (EAS)
The final correction to make to the information received from the pressure probes is the 
correction to compensate for the effect of compressibility.  Typically, at speeds beyond 220 
knots, the air ahead of the aeroplane does not move out of the way.  As a result, the air 
starts to build up and compress in front of the aeroplane.  This build-up of air has an effect 
called the compressibility effect.  If the probes are corrected for the compressibility error 
as well as position and instrument errors, the speed obtained is called equivalent airspeed, 
abbreviated to EAS.  Equivalent airspeed is the most accurate of the speeds which are obtained 
from dynamic pressure.  For the most part, this performance book will assume that indicated 
airspeed, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are the same.  But, unless otherwise 
stated, assume any reference to aeroplane speed as being indicated airspeed.
True Airspeed (TAS)
The next speed to consider is true airspeed, abbreviated to TAS.  True airspeed is the equivalent 
airspeed corrected for density error and as the name suggests is the true speed of the aircraft 
relative to the air through which the aeroplane is flying.
Below is a very simplified formula showing that true airspeed is proportional to the equivalent 
airspeed and inversely proportional to the density.  
TAS is proportional to  EAS ÷ DENSITY
If for a constant equivalent airspeed the density were to fall, the true airspeed would increase. 
This means that with increasing altitude at a constant equivalent airspeed, true airspeed 
increases, as shown by Figure 5.7.  
Figure 5.7 An illustration showing the relationship between EAS & TAS with altitude
True airspeed can be calculated by using the tables in the aeroplane flight manual, using a 
flight navigation computer or even using a calibration scale on the airspeed indicator.  True 
airspeed is mainly used for navigation and flight planning purposes.

True Ground Speed (TGS)
The next speed to consider is the true ground speed, abbreviated to TGS or just GS.  This 
represents the aeroplane’s speed within a fixed ground reference system.  Put more simply 
it is the aeroplane’s velocity over the ground.  The true ground speed is equal to the true 
airspeed plus or minus the wind component. If there is a tailwind then the aeroplane’s speed 
over the ground will increase by a value equal to the speed of the tailwind.  For example, if 
the true airspeed is 250 knots and the tailwind is 20 knots, the true ground speed is 270 knots. 
Conversely, if there is a headwind, the aircraft’s speed over the ground will be reduced by a 
value equal to the speed of the headwind.
For example, if the true airspeed is 250 knots and the headwind is 30 knots, the true ground 
speed is 220 knots.  If the headwind or tailwind components are not already known, these can 
be worked out using a flight navigation computer or by using graphs or tables in the aeroplane 
flight manual. CAP 698, Section 4, Page 4, Figure 4.1 can also be used.
At speeds higher than about 220 knots, some of the energy of the aeroplane goes into 
compressing the air ahead of the aeroplane and locally increasing the density of the air. 
Compressibility affects the amount of drag force on the aeroplane and the effect becomes 
more important as speed increases.  As the aeroplane moves through the air it makes noise 
simply by disturbing the air.  This noise emanates outwards in the form of pressure waves. 
These pressure waves stream out away from the aircraft at the speed of sound in all directions 
acting just like the ripples through water when a stone is dropped in the middle of a still pond.
Figure 5.8 An illustration showing pressure waves emanating from a 
theoretically stationary aeroplane.
However, as the aeroplane approaches the speed of sound it actually starts catching up with 
its own pressure waves in front if it as can be seen in Figure 5.9. These pressure waves turn into 
one big pressure shock wave which causes a loud bang, called a sonic boom. The shock wave 
generated actually buffets the aeroplane and decreases the lift force.

Figure 5.9 An illustration showing pressure waves emanating from an aeroplane flying at the speed of sound
Obviously, because of the increasing drag, decreasing lift and aeroplane buffet, pilots need to 
know when they are approaching the speed of sound.  
Mach Number
The ratio of the speed of the aeroplane to the speed of sound in the air determines the 
magnitude and intensity of many of the effects of high speed flight. Because of the importance 
of this speed ratio, aerodynamicists have given it a special name called the Mach number in 
honour of Ernst Mach, a late 19th century physicist who studied gas dynamics.  Mach number 
is not an actual speed as such; it is, as we have already said, the ratio of the true speed of the 
aeroplane to the local speed of sound. Mach number is best illustrated using an example.  To 
calculate the Mach number, simply divide the true airspeed (TAS) by the local speed of sound 
(LSS).  
MACH NUMBER  =  TAS ÷ LSS
At sea level in ISA conditions, the local speed of sound is 661 knots.  If the true airspeed of 
the aeroplane is 510 knots, then the Mach number is 0.77.  In other words, the aeroplane is 
travelling at about three quarters of the speed of sound.  If the aeroplane were to fly faster, 
the Mach number would increase.  If the aeroplane accelerated to 661 knots, then its speed 
would be equal to the speed of sound and the aeroplane would be at Mach 1.  Aeroplanes 
flying between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2 are said to be in transonic flight.  
The speed of sound varies with temperature.  As altitude increases, the reducing temperature 
causes the local speed of sound to fall.  At 30 000 ft the speed of sound is 590 knots.  If the true 
airspeed of the aeroplane is kept constant at 510 knots, as a result of the falling local speed of 
sound with altitude, the Mach number will increase.
As the aeroplane’s speed approaches Mach 1, the compressibility and approaching shock 
wave can have very detrimental effects on the aeroplane’s performance if the aeroplane is 
not designed to mitigate such effects.  As a result, most commercial aeroplanes in service 
today have a limit on the maximum Mach number they are allowed to fly at.  This maximum 
operating Mach number is called MMO.  Having discussed all the relevant speeds of an aeroplane 
it is important to understand the relationship of these speeds with one another as altitude 
changes.  This is best illustrated on a graph as shown in Figure 5.10.

Figure 5.10 An illustration showing the relationship of the various speeds with altitude
If calibrated airspeed, or simply indicated airspeed is kept constant with increasing altitude, 
then as density falls the true airspeed will increase, as shown in Figure 5.10.  But if true airspeed 
increases with increasing altitude, while the local speed of sound decreases, then the Mach 
number must increase.  These lines representing these three speeds can be manipulated to 
help solve complex problems.  
Figure 5.11 An illustration showing the relationship of the various speeds with altitude
If the true airspeed were to be kept constant with increasing altitude as shown in Figure 5.11, 
the TAS line would be drawn vertically and the CAS and Mach lines as shown.  Now, calibrated 
airspeed decreases whilst Mach number increases.

If Mach number were to be kept constant, the diagram could be drawn so that the Mach line 
is straight up as illustrated in Figure 5.12.  Notice that TAS and CAS decrease with increasing 
altitude.
Figure 5.12 An illustration showing the relationship of the various speeds with altitude
These graphs can also be used to see the relationship between the speeds when descending, 
just ensure to follow the lines down not up.  Therefore, looking at Figure 5.12, if the pilot was 
to descend at a constant Mach number, then the EAS and TAS will increase.
To help you remember how to draw the lines, C, T and M always appear from left to right.  You 
can use Britain’s favourite food “Chicken Tikka Masala” as an acronym for remembering C T 
and M and the order in which they appear in the graph.
Fuel Flow
In a turbojet, the fuel flow is proportional to thrust. Therefore, as thrust increases, fuel flow 
increases. For aeroplanes driven by a propeller regardless of engine type, fuel flow is proportional 
to power. Therefore when considering range and endurance, turboprop aeroplanes are treated 
as propeller aeroplanes.
Endurance
The next section of this chapter analyses the two cruise performance parameters: range and 
endurance. When flying for range we are asking the question - how much fuel will the aeroplane 
use per unit distance? When flying for endurance we are asking the question - how much fuel 
does the aeroplane use per unit time? Let us firstly deal with the endurance of the aeroplane. 
The endurance of an aeroplane is the time it can remain airborne on a given quantity of fuel or, 
put another way, endurance can be expressed as fuel used over a given airborne time.  The only 
time an aeroplane will be flown by the pilot for maximum endurance is when the aeroplane 
is in a holding pattern over its destination.  For instance, when there are long landing delays 
running out of fuel starts to become a problem.
--- Page 249 ---

General Principles - Cruise
Endurance is defined to be the ratio of airborne time to fuel used for that time.  
ENDURANCE = TIME (hr) ÷ FUEL (kg)
However, to use this formula a small adjustment needs to be made as shown:  
SPECIFIC ENDURANCE (hr/kg) = 1 ÷ FUEL FLOW
This now becomes the formula for specific endurance.  The units of specific endurance are 
airborne hours per kilogram of fuel consumed. The endurance of an aeroplane is simply a 
function of its fuel flow or fuel consumption.  An aeroplane which can minimize its fuel flow will 
achieve maximum endurance.  Therefore, when analysing the maximum endurance capability 
of an aeroplane it is necessary to understand what controls the fuel flow.  You should note that 
fuel flow calculations are different for a jet and a propeller aeroplane.  Let us examine the jet 
aeroplane first.  
Jet Aeroplane Endurance
FUEL FLOW = FUEL FLOW PER UNIT THRUST × TOTAL THRUST
Here, fuel flow is a function of the fuel used per unit of thrust, multiplied by the total number 
of thrust units.  Obviously if it were possible to reduce the fuel used per unit of thrust and the 
total number of thrust units required then the total fuel flow would be reduced.  Fuel used per 
unit thrust is most commonly known as specific fuel consumption which is abbreviated to SFC. 
The formula for fuel flow should be as shown below.
FUEL FLOW = SFC × TOTAL THRUST
The specific fuel consumption needs to be small, in other words, the aim is to reduce the 
amount of fuel used to produce each thrust unit.  For a jet engine this occurs when ambient 
temperature is very low and engine rpm is very high.  This can only occur at high altitude.  So, 
flying at high altitude, minimizes the fuel used per unit of thrust. 
Having minimized the fuel used to produce each unit of thrust, the aim is now to fly the 
aeroplane using minimum possible total thrust because each unit of thrust requires fuel to be 
consumed. This problem is comparatively simple to solve.  In level flight the forward acting 
force of thrust is controlled and balanced by the rearward acting force of drag.  If drag is small, 
the aeroplane need fly with only a small amount of thrust.  Looking at the formula below, 
thrust can be replaced by drag since the value of drag is equal and opposite to the value of 
thrust.
FUEL FLOW = SFC × TOTAL DRAG
To minimize drag, the jet aeroplane simply flies at the velocity for minimum drag.  Therefore 
VMD is the speed to fly for maximum endurance for a jet aeroplane. 
In summary then, for a jet aeroplane to maximize its endurance by minimizing its fuel flow, the 
pilot would fly the aeroplane at VMD and fly as high as possible.

Propeller Aeroplane Endurance
The situation with endurance and fuel flow for a propeller aeroplane is very similar to that 
for the jet aeroplane.  There is just one small difference in the formula we use.  Turboprop 
and piston engines first convert chemical energy in the fuel into power output on a shaft. The 
propeller then converts that power into thrust.  Therefore, for a propeller aeroplane, since the 
fuel is used to generate power and not thrust, the formula for fuel flow is fuel used per unit of 
power multiplied by the total units of power.  
FUEL FLOW = FUEL FLOW PER UNIT POWER × TOTAL POWER
Obviously to minimize the fuel flow, the fuel used per unit of power and the total number 
of power units must be kept to a minimum.  Fuel used per unit power as you already know 
is called specific fuel consumption.  Therefore, similar to a jet the formula for fuel flow for a 
propeller reads as below.
FUEL FLOW = SFC × TOTAL POWER
The specific fuel consumption value needs to be small but for the majority of propeller 
aeroplanes the value is more or less fixed.  However, in very general terms it is safe to say 
that for piston engines specific fuel consumption is a minimum at lower altitudes, whereas for 
turbo-propeller engines specific fuel consumption is a minimum at middle to high altitudes. 
Since specific fuel consumption is more or less fixed, the only other way to minimize fuel flow 
is to use the minimum amount of power.  This can be achieved by flying at the speed for 
minimum power required, or VMP.  Therefore note that, for a propeller aeroplane, it is VMP that 
is the speed for maximum endurance, whereas for a jet it is VMD.
Factors Affecting Endurance
Weight
Having studied how to achieve maximum endurance for both jet and propeller engines, let 
us now examine the factors that affect range. The first factor we must discuss is the effect of 
weight.  You will recall that increasing the weight of the aeroplane increases induced drag and 
this moves the total drag curve and power required curve up and right.  Looking at Figure 5.13 
you can see that for jet aeroplanes at higher weights, the aeroplane has more drag which will 
require more thrust and therefore require more fuel flow.  In this situation the endurance will 
decrease.

General Principles - Cruise
Figure 5.13 An illustration of the effect of weight on the drag & the speed for maximum endurance for a jet 
aeroplane
We must also note that the speed for maximum endurance, VMD is now higher.  For a propeller 
aeroplane the situation is similar.  For a propeller aeroplane at higher weights, more power is 
required, therefore fuel flow increases and endurance decreases, but also the speed for best 
endurance, VMP is higher.  This can be seen in Figure 5.14.

propeller aeroplane
--- Page 252 ---
General Principles - Cruise

General Principles - Cruise
There is one other effect that is seldom mentioned.  At higher weights, operating altitudes are 
lower, which for a jet aeroplane means that the specific fuel consumption increases, because 
at lower altitudes, the jet engine is less efficient.
Configuration
The next factor which affects endurance is the aeroplane’s configuration.  While it seems an 
obvious point that the gear and/or flaps should not be deployed in the cruise, there will be 
occasions when a pilot will find himself stacked with other aeroplanes in a holding pattern over 
the destination airfield.  As the aeroplane at the lowest level exits the hold to land, the other 
aeroplanes will have to descend to a lower hold and eventually prepare for the landing by 
deploying gear and flaps.  You will recall that deploying the flaps and undercarriage increases 
parasite drag and thus causes the total drag curve and power required curve to move up and 
left.  Looking at Figure 5.15 which is for a jet aeroplane and uses the drag curve, you can see 
that with the gear and flaps deployed, the aeroplane has more drag and therefore requires 
greater fuel flow, but notice that the speed for maximum endurance, VMD is now lower.  
Figure 5.15 An illustration of the effect of gear & flaps on the drag & the speed for maximum endurance for a jet 
aeroplane
Using Figure 5.16 which is for a propeller aeroplane, it is much the same.  With gear and flaps 
deployed, more power is required, therefore fuel flow increases and endurance decreases, but 
also the speed for best endurance, VMP is lower.
--- Page 253 ---

General Principles - Cruise
Figure 5.16 An illustration of the effect of gear and flaps on the power required & the speed for maximum 
endurance for a propeller aeroplane
Fuel flow in the landing configuration can increase by 150% compared to a clean configuration, 
so it important not to deploy gear or flaps too early and unnecessarily increase the fuel costs 
for the flight.
Wind and Altitude
The case of wind is quite simple.  It has no effect on endurance. You will remember that 
maximum endurance is concerned with minimizing fuel flow.  It should be obvious that wind 
does not affect the fuel flow into the engine.  Endurance is about time in the air, not distance 
covered.  Whatever the effect of wind, an aeroplane will still remain airborne only for as long 
as it has usable fuel in its tanks. 
Altitude however, does affect endurance.  Its effect though is a little complicated and is 
very dependent on engine type.  Generally jet aeroplanes become more efficient as altitude 
increases partly due to the decreasing ambient temperature, but also because of the increasing 
rpm required to maintain thrust.  Therefore, theoretically, the maximum endurance of a jet 
aeroplane will be achieved when flying at or above the tropopause where the ambient air 
temperature is lowest. 
Turbo-propeller aeroplanes function in a similar way to a jet since they are, in essence, jet engines 
with a propeller attached to a geared shaft.  However, even though the turbo-propeller engine 
gains efficiency with altitude, the power required increases due to the rising TAS offsetting 
the efficiency gains.  This means that for the majority of modern turbo-propeller aeroplanes, 
maximum endurance is achieved at around 10 000 ft or less.
Piston engine aeroplanes are most efficient at sea level when the manifold pressure is high and 
rpm is low, provided that the mixture has been leaned correctly.
--- Page 254 ---
General Principles - Cruise

General Principles - Cruise
In summary then, jet aeroplanes achieve maximum endurance at or above the tropopause; 
turbo-propeller aeroplanes reach maximum endurance at about 10 000 ft and piston engine 
aeroplanes have their maximum endurance at sea level.
Range
You have learnt that there are two performance parameters in the cruise: range and endurance. 
Let us now consider range.  Range is a more useful performance parameter than endurance, 
and one that aircraft designers continually try to improve.  Whereas endurance is about airborne 
time, range is more concerned with distance covered and it is, therefore, sometimes referred 
to as “fuel mileage”.  For range, not only is the concern to minimize the fuel flow, but more 
importantly to maximize the speed.  This will allow the aeroplane to travel a greater distance.
Maximum range can be defined as being the maximum distance an aeroplane can fly for a 
given fuel quantity consumed or to put it another way, the minimum fuel used by an aeroplane 
over a given distance.  This latter expression of range is more commonly used for commercial 
operations.  As a formula, range is simply the distance in nautical miles divided by fuel quantity 
in kilograms.  
RANGE = DISTANCE (NM) ÷ FUEL (kg)
However, in the same way as we did for the formula for endurance we must adjust our range 
formula needs in order for it to give us useful information.   The range that an aeroplane can 
achieve is determined by the speed of the aeroplane and the fuel flow.  The top line of the 
formula is nautical air miles per hour (TAS) and the bottom line of the formula is kilograms of 
fuel per hour.   Thus the formula now reads true airspeed divided by fuel flow. 
SPECIFIC RANGE (SR) = TAS ÷ FUEL FLOW
This is the formula for specific air range.  The formula shows that specific air range is defined 
as the ratio of true airspeed to the fuel flow.  You may recall from the endurance section that 
fuel flow is specific fuel consumption multiplied by drag for a jet and specific fuel consumption 
multiplied by power required for a propeller driven aeroplane.  Looking at the formulae it is 
now obvious that in order to maximize the specific range of the aeroplane, true airspeed must 
be high, and the fuel flow must be low.
JET SPECIFIC RANGE (SR) = TAS ÷ (SFC × DRAG)
PROPELLER SPECIFIC RANGE (SR) = TAS ÷ (SFC × POWER REQUIRED)
Jet Aeroplane Range
Let us now focus on the specific air range of the jet aeroplane.  We stated earlier that to 
maximize the range, the TAS must be high, and the specific fuel consumption and the drag 
must be low.  Shown in Figure 5.17 is a drag curve for a jet aeroplane.  If the aeroplane were to 
fly at VMD then of course the drag force would be at its lowest.  
If we look at the formula for specific range as shown in the graph, it seems we have solved one 
of the points, namely how to make drag as low as possible.  However, notice that because the 
drag curve is fairly flat at the bottom, the speed may be increased significantly from VMD for 
only a small drag penalty.

125
          General Principles - Cruise

General Principles - Cruise
Figure 5.17 A graph showing the speed for maximum range for a jet aeroplane
We can therefore see that whilst drag has increased a little, which is bad for range, the airspeed 
has increased significantly, which is good for range.  Consequently the overall effect is that 
there is an increase in specific range.  
The speed at which the speed over drag ratio is maximized may be read from the graph at the 
point of contact of the tangent from the origin to the curve.  You may recall that this speed 
was 1.32VMD.  Therefore it is 1.32VMD that is the speed for maximum range for a jet aeroplane. 
There is now only one remaining item left in the formula which still needs to be resolved.  In 
order to increase range even more, specific fuel consumption must be decreased.   You may 
recall that the only way to do this for a jet aeroplane is to operate at as high an altitude 
as possible.  Operating as high as possible will give us a higher true airspeed for any given 
indicated airspeed which, again, will improve the specific range.
Propeller Aeroplane Range
Having completed the analysis of range for a jet aeroplane, let us now examine specific air 
range for a propeller aeroplane.  We stated earlier that to maximize the specific range, the TAS 
must be high, and the specific fuel consumption and the power required must be low.  Shown 
in Figure 5.18 is the power required curve for a propeller aeroplane.  If the aeroplane were 
to fly at VMP then of course its engine would be delivering minimum power required for level 
flight.  It seems, then, that we have solved one of the components, namely to make power 
required as small as possible.
--- Page 256 ---
General Principles - Cruise

General Principles - Cruise
Figure 5.18 A graph showing the speed for maximum range for a propeller aeroplane
However, looking at the graph, you will notice, like for the jet aeroplane, that because the power 
required curve is fairly flat at the bottom, the aeroplane speed may be increased significantly 
from VMP for only a small penalty increase in the power required. You can see that whilst power 
required has increased a little, which is bad for range, the airspeed has increased significantly, 
which is good for range.  Consequently the overall effect is an increase in the range.  The point 
at which the speed power ratio is at a maximum is the point of contact of the tangent from the 
origin to the curve.  You may recall that this speed is VMD.  Therefore it is VMD that is the speed 
for maximum range for a propeller aeroplane.  
There is now only one remaining item left in the formula which still needs to be resolved.  In 
order to maximize range even more, specific fuel consumption must be decreased.  However, 
you may remember that specific fuel consumption for piston aeroplane is more or less best at 
low altitudes, whereas for turbo-propeller aeroplanes which use jet engines, the specific fuel 
consumption decreases with altitude up to a point about halfway up the troposphere.

Factors Affecting Range
Weight
Having studied how to achieve maximum range for both jet and propeller engines, let us now 
examine the factors that affect range. The first of the factors to discuss is the effect of weight. 
You will recall that increasing the weight of the aeroplane increases induced drag and thus 
moves the total drag curve and power required curve up and right.  
Figure 5.19 A graph showing the effect of weight on drag & the speed for maximum range for a jet aeroplane
Looking at Figure 5.19 which is for a jet aeroplane, you can see for higher weights, the aeroplane 
is subject to a higher drag force and therefore requires a higher rate of fuel flow.  This will 
decrease specific range.  However, notice that the speed for maximum range, 1.32VMD, is now 
higher.

Figure 5.20 A graph showing the effect of weight on power required & the speed for maximum range for a 
propeller aeroplane
Using Figure 5.20 which is for a propeller driven aeroplane, it is much the same as the jet.  At 
higher weights, more power is required, therefore fuel flow increases and range decreases. 
However, notice too, that the speed for best range, VMD, is higher.
Remember also that at higher weights, the operating altitudes are reduced, which for a jet 
aeroplane means that the specific fuel consumption increases, because at lower altitudes, the 
jet engine is less efficient. 
There is a linear relationship between weight and fuel flow – assuming identical aeroplanes,  at 
the same altitude and the same specific fuel consumption.
If we know the fuel flow for an aeroplane at one weight we can calculate the fuel flow at an 
alternate weight. 
For example;  an aeroplane has a weight of 120 000 kg with a fuel flow of 4400 kg/hr. An 
identical aeroplane at the same altitude and specific fuel consumption but weighing 110 000 
kg would have a fuel flow of:-
4400/120 000 = .03666 then multiplied by 110 000 kg gives 4033.33 kg/hr.
In other words; the percentage change in the fuel flow is proportional to the percentage 
change in aircraft weight.

Payload  vs Range
One of the most important issues that airline operators need to consider is the choice of the 
aeroplane they operate.  This choice is mainly based upon the required aeroplane’s payload 
and range.  These requirements can be best described by going through a typical example. 
Shown in Figure 5.21 is the payload range graph for a Boeing triple seven.  On the vertical axis 
is the payload in thousands of kilograms and the horizontal axis shows the aeroplane range in 
thousands of nautical miles.
Figure 5.21 A graph showing the payload versus the range of a typical Boeing 777
Using Figure 5.21, as the payload is initially added to the aeroplane the marker moves from 
point A to point B.  However, payload will reach a maximum when either there is no more 
space on the aeroplane or the aeroplane has reached its zero fuel mass (ZFM).  Notice that 
the range at point B is zero because no fuel has been added yet.  Fuel is now added to the 
aeroplane and the blue marker line moves to the right showing an increase in range.  Adding 
fuel can continue until the maximum structural take-off mass is achieved. This is shown by point 
C on the graph.  Although maximum mass has been reached, it is unlikely that the tanks are 
full at this stage.  To increase range further, more fuel must be added.  But since the maximum 
mass has been achieved, the only way to add more fuel is if some of the payload is exchanged 
for fuel.  Now the marker will start to move down and right.  This shows that range is increasing 
but the payload is decreasing.  Swapping payload for fuel in this way can continue only until 
the tanks are full, as shown by point D.  From point C to point D the total mass of the aeroplane 
has remained constant since we are simply swapping payload for fuel.
The only way to increase the range beyond point D, even though the tanks are full, is to remove 
the rest of the payload.  You will recall that reducing weight increases range.  Reducing the 
payload completely moves the marker line from point D to point E.  At point E, the aeroplane 
has full tanks, maximum range but no payload.  
In the majority of airlines the trade-off between range and payload is carried out on initial 
aeroplane purchase and, thereafter, during in-flight planning.  As a pilot it is unlikely you will 
be required to work through these graphs other than to check and confirm the data that has 
been prepared in advanced for you.
--- Page 260 ---

Configuration
Another factor affecting the range is the aeroplane’s configuration.  You will recall that 
deploying the flaps and gear increases parasite drag and thus moves the total drag curve and 
power required curve up and left, as shown in Figure 5.22.  
Figure 5.22 A graph showing the effect of configuration on drag & the speed for maximum range for a jet 
aeroplane
You can see that with the gear and flaps deployed, the aeroplane has more drag and therefore 
needs more thrust which, in turn, requires greater fuel flow.  This will decrease the range. 
However, notice that the speed for maximum range, 1.32VMD, is now lower.

Figure 5.23 A graph showing the effect of configuration on power required & the speed for maximum range for a 
propeller aeroplane
Looking at Figure 5.23 which is the range graph for a propeller aeroplane you can see that 
matters are much the same.  With gear and flaps deployed, more power is required.  Therefore 
fuel flow increases and range decreases.  But also notice that the speed for best range, VMD, is 
lower.
A point always to bear in mind in the cruise is that any increase in parasite drag will be 
detrimental to range and endurance. Increases in parasite drag can be caused by any number 
of things such as damaged and misaligned surfaces.  The extra drag created by misaligned or 
misrigged airframe surfaces creates a type of drag called excrescence drag.  This can be more 
than 4% of the aeroplane’s total drag.  Careful preflight inspection should reveal misaligned or 
misrigged surfaces.
An important point to consider over which the pilot has direct control is aeroplane trim.  A pilot 
must periodically check the aileron and rudder trim, the spoiler misfair and the trailing edges 
to ensure that the aeroplane is “in trim” and is in balanced flight.  Monitoring the aeroplane’s 
control surfaces will help to reduce the extra drag and extra fuel consumption that out of trim 
and unbalanced flight can cause.
Lastly, contamination on the airframe from airframe icing can affect fuel flow.  This icing will 
not only change the shape of the wing, making it less efficient at producing lift, but it will also 
increase weight and drag.  All this is detrimental to aircraft performance and will reduce the 
aeroplane’s range.

Wind
Wind is the next of the major factors affecting the range of an aeroplane.  Headwinds will 
cause the aircraft to travel slower over the ground and therefore cover less distance for a given 
level of fuel consumption.   Thus, in headwinds range is reduced.  In order to minimize this 
effect the speed of the aeroplane is increased by a margin slightly less than the amount of the 
headwind.  The increase in speed will increase the thrust and the power required and therefore 
the fuel consumption, but on a positive side the aeroplane will be exposed to the headwind 
for a shorter time period if it is flying faster. This higher speed then recovers some of the range 
loss caused by the headwind.  On the contrary, a tailwind will increase the ground speed and 
increase the distance covered for a given level of fuel consumption, thereby increasing range. 
For maximum range with a tailwind, the speed for the best range should be decreased slightly 
so as to reduce the thrust and power required.  This will therefore reduce the fuel flow and 
increase the range a little more. The reduction in speed is slightly less than the speed of the 
tailwind component being experienced.
Figure 5.24 A graph showing the effect of a headwind on the speed for maximum range for a jet aeroplane
The headwind and tailwind speed changes can be seen on the drag and power curves for the 
jet and propeller aeroplane.  However, to simplify things, we will just concentrate on the drag 
curve for the jet aeroplane.
Looking at Figure 5.24, with a 20 knot headwind, the origin of the tangent line moves 20 knots 
to the right.  Notice that the tangent meets the curve at a point corresponding to a higher 
speed, thus confirming that in a headwind the speed for best range is higher.  The opposite 
is the case in a tailwind scenario.  With a tailwind of 20 knots, the origin of the tangent line 
moves 20 knots left.  The tangent meets the curve at a point corresponding to a lower speed. 
This confirms that in a tailwind the speed for best range is lower than in conditions of zero 
wind.

Altitude (Jet Aeroplanes)
The effect of altitude on the range of an aeroplane is important, especially for a jet aeroplane. 
Below is the formula for the specific air range for a jet aeroplane.  Let us examine how the 
variables change with increasing altitude.   
SPECIFIC RANGE (SR) = TAS ÷ (SFC × DRAG)
As aeroplane operating altitude increases, the colder air and requirement for increasing rpm 
cause the specific fuel consumption to decrease which will help to increase the specific air 
range.  However, there are two other variables left to consider, namely the true airspeed and 
the drag.  
Let us deal with true airspeed first.  If you think back to the part of the lesson where we were 
analysing the effects of altitude on the various speeds, you will recall that if the aeroplane 
operates at higher and higher altitudes at the constant indicated or calibrated airspeed of 
1.32VMD, the true airspeed increases.  The effect of increasing altitude and therefore increasing 
true airspeed acts together with the reducing specific fuel consumption to help increase the 
specific range.  Therefore, specific range increases with altitude. 
However, the last element of the formula to consider is drag.  You will recall that with altitude, 
as the true airspeed increases and the local speed of sound decreases, the Mach number 
increases.  This means that the aeroplane is approaching the speed of sound and approaching its 
maximum operating Mach number, MMO.  The problem with this is that beyond a certain Mach 
number, the compressibility factor and approaching shock wave will cause drag to increase. 
This will be detrimental to the specific range as you can see by the formula.  However, it is a 
little more complicated.  As altitude increases, if the Mach number is allowed to get too high, 
the penalty due to drag will start to outweigh the benefits of increasing TAS and reducing 
specific fuel consumption.  It is at this point that the specific air range will start to reduce. 
Using the left hand blue line in the graph in Figure 5.25 you can see that initially specific range 
increases with altitude but then above a certain altitude the specific range decreases.

Optimum Altitude
Using the left hand blue line in Figure 5.25 you will notice that there is an altitude at which 
the specific range is greatest; in our example this is just below 33 000 ft.  This altitude is called 
the optimum altitude.  It is defined as being the pressure altitude which provides the greatest 
specific range or fuel mileage at a given weight and speed. Flying higher or lower than the 
optimum altitude will decrease the range of the aeroplane.
It is important to understand that the optimum altitude is not fixed.  You will recall that as the 
weight decreases through fuel burn, the drag curve moves down and left.  Therefore, the best 
range speed, 1.32VMD, falls and the total drag decreases.  Therefore, with decreasing weight 
the aeroplane needs to slow down to maintain the best range speed.  As it does so, the Mach 
number will also decrease meaning that the aeroplane is not limited by the high Mach number 
and corresponding high drag.  This fact allows the aeroplane to climb a little.  As the aeroplane 
climbs, the Mach number will increase again to its previous limiting value and drag will increase 
back to its previous value.  But more importantly the higher altitude has decreased the specific 
fuel consumption.  Therefore, the specific air range increases during this little climb.  This means 
that over time, as the weight decreases with fuel burn, the optimum altitude increases.  You 
can see this in Figure 5.25 by comparing the specific range line for high and low weight.  Notice 
too that as the optimum altitude increases, the specific range increases.  Plotting the change of 
the optimum altitude over time can be seen in Figure 5.26.
Figure 5.26 A graph showing the optimum altitude increasing with a reduction in weight as the flight progresses 
for a typical jet aeroplane
In order for the aeroplane to maximize the specific range the aeroplane must stay with the 
optimum altitude as the optimum altitude slowly increases, in other words the aeroplane must 
climb along the green line shown in Figure 5.26.  Climbing in this way is sometimes called a
--- Page 265 ---
5
135
          General Principles - Cruise
5
General Principles - Cruise
“cruise climb”.  But carrying out a cruise climb is not always possible, since air traffic control and 
airspace congestion may predetermine flight cruising levels.  If this is the case, in order to stay 
close to the optimum altitude, step climbs may be performed and are shown by the dashed 
yellow line in Figure 5.26.  
Step Climbs
Step climbs essentially mean that the aeroplane climbs to about 2000 ft above the optimum 
altitude and levels off.  As fuel is used and weight falls, the optimum altitude will increase to a 
point where it is again 2000 ft above the aeroplane’s current level but it can take up to 3 hours 
for it to do so.  At its current level the aeroplane can then climb 4000 ft and level off so that it 
will once again be 2000 ft above the optimum altitude.  But, if the last step climb is within 200 
NM of the top of descent, then the fuel saving is negated and the aeroplane should remain 
level.
The step climb process can be repeated throughout the cruise and it helps to explain why the 
cruise altitudes at the end of the flight are higher than at the start. 
Carrying out step climbs in this way, rather than always staying with the optimum altitude, will 
increase fuel consumption by about 1% and therefore decrease the maximum range by 1%. 
This may not sound like much, but over a year a typical 747 would have used an extra 34 000 
tonnes of fuel.  If an aeroplane did not even step climb and simply remained at a constant 
altitude during the cruise, then the aeroplane would increase its fuel consumption by 10% 
compared to flying constantly at the optimum altitude.  This demonstrates just how important 
altitude and speed control are in the cruise for a typical commercial flight.  
Altitude (Propeller Aeroplanes)
Having discussed the effect of altitude on the jet aeroplane, let us now consider the effect of 
altitude on the propeller aeroplane.  In general though, we may say that most turbo-propeller 
aeroplanes operate significantly lower than their jet counterparts.  Turbo-propeller aeroplanes 
seldom operate above 30 000 ft, and therefore never really suffer from the effects of getting 
close to the speed of sound.  Turbo-propellers are based on the same engine design as a pure 
jet, therefore, the effect of altitude on the turbo-propeller is very similar to the jet aeroplane. 
As altitude, increases the increasing TAS and slightly decreasing specific fuel consumption 
help to improve the specific range.  However, this benefit is offset a little by the increasing 
power required at higher altitude.  So whilst specific range does improve with altitude, above 
10 000 ft it only improves by a small amount.  The choice of altitude may depend more on the 
wind considerations and the time and fuel considerations involved in climbing to the selected 
altitude.
The other type of propeller aeroplane is that driven by a piston engine.  You will recall that 
the piston engine aeroplane has a more or less fixed specific fuel consumption even though 
specific fuel consumption is lowest at high manifold pressures, low rpm and with the mixture 
correctly set.  Therefore, the only remaining variables in the specific air range formula for the 
piston engine aeroplane are the true airspeed and the power required.

Figure 5.27 A graph showing the specific range with altitude for a typical piston propeller driven aeroplane
As the aeroplane operates at higher and higher altitudes the power required to maintain 
the range speed will increase.  This of course is detrimental to range.  However, as altitude 
increases, true airspeed increases for any given indicated airspeed and this is good for range. 
This fact slightly more than offsets the increase of power required and therefore the specific 
range slowly increases with altitude.  However, the aeroplane will reach an altitude where the 
throttle needs to be fully advanced to maintain the selected speed.  This altitude is called the 
full throttle height and it is shown in Figure 5.27. Beyond this altitude the selected power and 
selected airspeed cannot be maintained and the aeroplane will slow down.  Very soon after 
this altitude, the true airspeed will also start to fall despite the decreasing density.  This fact, 
combined with the constantly increasing amount of power required, means that the specific 
range will decrease.   As a result, maximum specific range will be attained just after full throttle 
height.
Wind Altitude Trade-Off
The effect of headwinds and tailwinds on the range of the aeroplane can play a significant 
role in the choice of cruising altitude.  For example, if there is a considerable headwind at 
the selected cruising altitude, this will be detrimental to the range.  In this case, it may be 
beneficial to operate at a different altitude where the winds might be more favourable. In 
large commercial operations most of these considerations are dealt with prior to the flight 
by the flight planning personnel.  However, in smaller operations, and if conditions change in 
flight, a pilot may have to carry out a wind altitude trade-off calculation.  Information enabling 
the pilot to do this is usually given in the aeroplane flight manual, an example of which is 
shown in Figure 5.28.

Long Range Cruise (LRC)
Figure 5.29 shows the relationship between the speed of the aeroplane and its range.  The top 
of the blue curve represents the point of maximum range and the speed at which this is found. 
For a jet aeroplane you will recall this speed is 1.32VMD.  In commercial operations this speed is 
more commonly referred to as the Maximum Range Cruise or MRC.  
Figure 5.29 A graph showing the relationship between aeroplane speed & range
However, maximum range cruise speed is seldom flown.  Usually, a higher speed is used.  Looking 
at the top of the graph, you will notice the line is fairly flat.  This means that a significant speed 
increase can be achieved with only a small compromise in range.  This higher speed is called the 
Long Range Cruise (LRC).  The long range cruise speed is about 4% higher than the maximum 
range cruise speed, and as such the specific range reduces by about 1%.  The reason for using 
this higher speed is simply that there are costs other than fuel which need to be considered in 
commercial operations.  A more detailed explanation of the relationships of these costs and 
how they affect the operations will be dealt with later on.

Landing Distance
The landing stage of flight is defined as being that stage of flight commencing from 50 ft 
above the landing threshold and terminating when the aeroplane comes to a complete stop 
as shown by Figure 6.1.  The 50 ft point is sometimes referred to as the landing screen height. 
The landing screen height is fixed at 50 ft for all classes of aeroplane unlike the take-off screen 
height which is 35 ft for Class A aeroplanes and 50 ft for Class B aeroplanes.
From the approach down to the landing screen height the aeroplane must have attained the 
landing reference speed, known as VREF.   VREF for Class A aeroplanes must be no less than the 
greater of 1.23 times the stall reference speed in the landing configuration (1.23VSR0) and the 
velocity of minimum control in the landing configuration (VMCL).  VREF for all other classes of 
aeroplane must be no less than 1.3 times the stall speed (1.3VS0) in the landing configuration. 
VREF is a very important speed to attain since the landing distances in the aeroplane flight 
manual are based on aeroplanes flying at VREF. Therefore, if a landing aeroplane is not at VREF, 
the landing distance given by the manual will not be achieved by the pilot.  A landing carried 
out at a speed other than VREF could seriously jeopardize the safety of the landing. 
Figure 6.1 Landing distance
The landing can be divided into two parts.  We call these the airborne section and the ground 
run or landing roll. The first part, the airborne section, starts from the landing screen height 
of 50 ft and ends when the aeroplane’s main wheels touch the landing surface.  The airborne 
section is usually given as being about 1000 ft in length.  Within the airborne section certain 
critical actions take place.  On descending through the screen height the thrust is reduced to 
zero and the aeroplane pitch attitude is increased slightly so that the aeroplane is in a slight 
nose-up attitude.  The increase in pitch attitude helps to arrest the rate of descent and the 
reduction in thrust to zero reduces the speed.  This procedure of reducing thrust and increasing 
pitch is known as the landing flare, although other terms like “roundout” are commonly used. 
The landing flare will allow the aeroplane to touch down onto the runway using the main 
wheels first.  It is important to understand that the technique of flaring the aeroplane differs 
from one aeroplane to another and especially so between light general aviation aeroplanes 
and large commercial jet airliners.
The second part of the landing is the ground run, ground roll or landing roll.  This is the distance 
covered from touchdown until the aeroplane comes to full stop.  As with the airborne section, 
there are a few critical actions that are carried out.  Once the main wheels have settled onto 
the landing surface reverse thrust and lift spoilers can be activated and as the speed decreases 
further, the nose wheel will then settle onto the landing surface.   Braking force is now applied 
and the aeroplane will slow to a stop.  However, in normal operations, the aeroplane does 
not stop on the runway; rather the aeroplane is slowed to a safe speed where it can then be 
steered off the runway and taxied to the disembarkation point or ramp.

General Principles - Landing
The combined length of the ‘airborne section’ and the ‘ground run or ‘landing roll’ is known as 
the “landing distance required”.  Pilots need to make sure that the landing distance required 
does not exceed the landing distance available.  
Landing Distance Available (LDA)
The landing distance available is the distance from the point on the surface of the aerodrome 
above which the aeroplane can commence its landing, having regard to the obstructions in 
its approach path, to the nearest point in the direction of landing at which the surface of 
the aerodrome is incapable of bearing the weight of the aeroplane under normal operating 
conditions or at which there is an obstacle capable of affecting the safety of the aeroplane.  
Figure 6.2 Landing distance available
In short, the landing distance available is the length of runway from one threshold to another. 
These are not always at the end of the runway, sometimes there are displaced thresholds which 
are some way in from the end of the paved surface.  You will recall that the landing distance 
starts at 50 ft.  This point must be directly above the threshold.  Landing on the threshold is 
not the aim of the landing.
Lift and Weight
In order to better understand landing performance we need to analyse the forces acting 
upon the aeroplane, and how these forces might be modified throughout the landing.  The 
first of the forces that we will consider is weight.  As you have learnt already, weight acts 
vertically downwards towards the centre of the earth from the centre of gravity.  During flight, 
weight is mainly balanced by lift.  However, once the aeroplane is on the ground weight is 
balanced by the reaction of the ground acting up through the wheels on the undercarriage. 
The weight of the aeroplane on landing will be less than at take-off due to the fact that fuel 
has been consumed.  There is, however, a maximum structural landing mass which must not 
be exceeded.  Let us now consider lift.  Whilst lift helps to balance weight when in the air, once 
the aeroplane is on the ground, lift is no longer required. In fact during the landing roll, lift is 
detrimental to the landing performance.  Producing lift will reduce the load placed on wheels 
and therefore decrease the braking effect.  In large commercial aeroplanes once the main

General Principles - Landing
wheels have settled on the runway the lift spoilers or lift dumpers are deployed which act very 
quickly to disrupt the airflow over the wing and destroy lift.
Reverse Thrust
Whilst in level flight the forward acting force of thrust is essential to maintain sufficient speed 
for the wings to provide lift.  During landing, because the aim is to bring the aeroplane to a 
stop, the thrust force must be reduced to zero.  Any residual thrust would be detrimental to the 
landing performance.  However, large propeller and jet aeroplane engines have the capability 
of redirecting the force of thrust in order to generate a braking effect on the aeroplane.  This 
is known as reverse thrust.  Reverse thrust helps to reduce the aeroplane’s forward speed. 
Reverse thrust capability is especially important in conditions where braking force is reduced 
due to ice or water contamination on the runway.
Jet Engines
Jet engines produce reverse thrust by using one of several methods, but all jet engines follow 
the same basic principle which is to redirect the jet efflux in a forwards direction.  Many modern 
aeroplanes have a safety device whereby reverse thrust is not activated until a certain value 
of the aeroplane’s weight is pressing down on the main wheels and until the wheels have 
reached a certain speed of rotation.  Once the aeroplane’s reverse thrust system has detected 
this, reverse thrust is activated and the engine will reconfigure itself so that the exhaust gas 
flow can be redirected forwards.  You can see the extent of the reconfiguration in Figure 6.3.
Figure 6.3 An illustration of a jet engine during reverse thrust mode
However, pilots need to recognize that the process of getting the engines reconfigured to 
generate full reverse thrust takes time, and so the aeroplane will have travelled a small distance 
from the touchdown point before reverse thrust takes effect.  This fact reduces the effective 
time period during which reverse thrust can be used.  Therefore, the effectiveness of reverse 
thrust on landing is reduced.
--- Page 282 ---
General Principles - Landing

General Principles - Landing
It is important to note too that jet engine reverse thrust cannot be maintained right up to the 
point when the aeroplane comes to a full stop.  Reverse thrust must be deactivated before 
the forward speed reduces to a minimum value.   As the aeroplane slows down the redirected 
airflow may start to be re-ingested into the compressor.  This means that the jet engine recycles 
its own gas flow which significantly increases the engine temperatures but it also means that 
debris on the runway can be sucked into the engine, potentially causing major damage.   As a 
result of this danger to the engines at low forward speeds reverse thrust must be deactivated 
below about 50 kt.
The combined effect of late reverse thrust activation and early reverse thrust deactivation 
means that the time period for which reverse thrust can be used may be quite short.
Propeller Aeroplanes
Large turbo-propeller aeroplanes are also able to generate reverse thrust by redirecting the 
air flow forwards, but they do so in a very different way than that employed by a jet engine. 
For forward flight the propeller blade is angled in such a way as to displace air backwards 
thus producing forward thrust.  In order for the propeller blade to direct air forwards and 
create a rearward acting force, the blade angle must change.  The blade angle required for the 
propeller to generate reverse thrust is known as reverse pitch.  Because only a change of blade 
angle is required, a propeller aeroplane can switch from forward to reverse thrust far quicker 
than a jet aeroplane.  This means that a propeller aeroplane can use reverse thrust earlier in the 
landing roll than a jet aeroplane.  
A propeller aeroplane can also maintain reverse thrust until the aeroplane comes to a full 
stop.  This capability gives the propeller aeroplane a greater braking advantage over the jet 
aeroplane during landing. 
In summary, the usable period of reverse thrust in the landing roll is shorter for a jet aeroplane 
than for a propeller aeroplane.  For this reason, the authorities have laid down less stringent 
landing performance regulations for propeller aeroplanes.  The precise nature of these 
regulations will be discussed later.
Drag
Let us now consider the action of the drag force during landing.  You may recall that there are 
several forms of drag.   The main types of drag are parasite drag and induced drag.  However, 
whilst the aeroplane is on the ground, during take-off and landing, wheel drag must be 
considered alongside the aerodynamic drag.  The aim of the landing is to bring the aeroplane 
to a stop safely within the confines of the runway.  In order to decelerate, sufficient rearward 
directed forces need to act on the aeroplane.  Consequently, in addition to reverse thrust 
aerodynamic drag plays a crucial role in landing.  
Induced Drag
Of the two types of aerodynamic drag, we will deal with induced drag first.  Induced drag is 
dependent on lift and is proportional to angle of attack.  During the airborne section of the 
landing, there is still a large amount of lift being generated and the angle of attack is relatively 
high.  This means that induced drag is far higher than in cruising flight.   However, when the 
aeroplane nose wheel touches the runway, the angle of attack is almost nil.  Induced drag is 
consequently reduced to zero.
--- Page 283 ---

                    General Principles - Landing

General Principles - Landing
Parasite Drag
The second form of aerodynamic drag is parasite drag.  Parasite drag is a function of the 
aeroplane’s forward facing cross-sectional area, more accurately known as form drag, and of 
the aeroplane’s forward speed.  The configuration of the aeroplane for landing is such that 
the flaps and slats are fully extended which significantly increases the aeroplane’s form drag 
and therefore significantly increases parasite drag.  Once the aeroplane touches down and the 
spoilers and speed brakes are deployed, parasite drag increases even further.  However, as the 
speed rapidly decays after touchdown, so will the parasite drag; eventually decreasing to zero 
once the aeroplane reaches a full stop.
In summary then, the aerodynamic drag comprising induced drag and parasite drag will be very 
high during the early part of the landing, but very soon after touchdown will decay rapidly. 
Wheel and Brake Drag
Having discussed aerodynamic drag, let us now consider wheel drag and brake drag.  Wheel 
drag is the friction force between the wheel and the runway and with the wheel bearings, 
whereas brake drag is the friction force between the brake discs and the brake pads.  Wheel 
drag will come into play as soon as the aeroplane touches down on the runway.  However, 
as friction is a function of the force pushing two surfaces together, because there is still a 
lot of lift being generated, wheel load is small during the initial part of the landing run, and 
therefore wheel drag is also small.  As speed reduces and as lift is destroyed by the spoilers, the 
wheel load increases which in turn increases the wheel drag.  Therefore, wheel drag increases 
throughout the landing roll and will reach a maximum value just before the aeroplane comes 
to rest.
Brake drag is by far the most important and the most effective of the various drag forces during 
the landing since it provides the greatest retarding force.  However, brake drag is only effective 
if there is also sufficient wheel drag or wheel friction between the tyres and the runway. If 
wheel drag is low, brake drag will also be low.  Consequently, the brakes are effective only 
if there is sufficient friction between the tyres and the runway.  During the early part of the 
landing run there is not much load on the wheels and therefore not much wheel friction. 
Brake drag is consequently ineffective in slowing down the aeroplane.  However, as the lift 
reduces and more weight is placed on the wheels, brake drag does become more effective in 
slowing down the aeroplane.  Therefore, brake drag increases as the landing roll progresses. 
This concept explains why pilots need to destroy lift as soon as possible after touchdown so 
that the braking action can be at its peak effectiveness early on in the landing.
In most large commercial aeroplanes, however, the braking action may not actually be carried 
out by the pilots.  Instead it can be carried out by a highly effective automatic anti-skid braking 
system.  This braking system can be set to low, medium or high braking levels, or levels 1 
through to 3, and it is especially important to use it when landing on contaminated runways.

Figure 6.4 A graph showing the variations in drag through the landing roll
In summary then, the first of the drag forces we discussed was aerodynamic drag.  As speed 
decreased during the landing run, aerodynamic drag comprising parasite and induced drag 
decreased.  
Brake drag on the other hand increased during the landing roll as more load was placed on the 
wheels.  Notice that during the early part of the landing roll, aerodynamic drag provides the 
majority of the drag, whereas once the speed has dropped below 70% of the landing speed, 
brake drag provides the majority of the drag.  
The last line on the graph is total drag.  From this line you can see that during the landing roll, 
total drag increases.  Overall, you can see how important brake drag is.  If the brakes were to 
fail, or the landing surface is very slippery, then the loss of braking would cause the landing 
performance to massively deteriorate therefore increasing the landing distance.

Landing Distance Formula
Now we will examine what determines the landing distance, and also what roles the four 
forces play.  In order to do this, let us briefly detail the formula that is used to calculate the 
landing distance.  In Figure 6.5 you can see the landing distance formula.  The letter “s” is the 
displacement or distance required to stop from a specified speed which is “V” with a given 
deceleration “d”.  Deceleration is force divided by mass.  The force is aerodynamic drag, plus 
the braking coefficient which is a function of wheel load, minus thrust, or in the case of reverse 
thrust, plus thrust. 
Figure 6.5 The expanded landing distance formula
Expanding the formula in this manner allows you to see how a change in one of the variables 
has a knock-on effect on the landing distance.   We will now analyse in detail all the factors that 
can affect the landing, with our principal concern being how these factors affect the landing 
distance.
Effect of Variable Factors on Landing Distance
Weight
The mass of the aeroplane affects:
•	 the stalling speed and hence VREF 
•	 the deceleration for a given decelerating force
•	 the wheel drag
Increased mass increases stalling speed, and reduces the deceleration for a given decelerating 
force, both effects increasing the landing distance.  Increased mass increases the brake drag 
available (if not torque limited) and this decreases the landing distance.  The net effect is that 
the landing distance will increase with increasing mass, but to a lesser degree than the increase 
of take-off distance with increasing mass.
--- Page 286 ---
General Principles - Landing

General Principles - Landing
Density
The air density affects:
•	 the TAS for a given IAS
•	 the thrust or power of the engine
As thrust is small the main effect will be on the TAS.  Low density (high temperature, low 
pressure or high humidity) will give an increase in the landing distance due to the higher TAS, 
but again to a lesser degree than for the take-off distance.
Wind
You will recall that headwinds decrease the true ground speed of the aeroplane for any given 
indicated airspeed.  Thus, during a headwind, the forward speed over the landing surface is 
much less and as a result the distance required to bring the aeroplane to rest is decreased. 
A tailwind will have the opposite effect and it will increase the ground speed for a given 
indicated airspeed.  Thus, during a tailwind, the forward speed over the landing surface is 
much greater and as a result the distance required to bring the aeroplane to rest is increased. 
When examining the effects that winds have on landing performance, it is recommended that 
you do not use the actual wind that is given just in case the wind changes to a worse condition 
than the one you have planned for.
When calculating actual landing distances, it is recommended that you assume only 50% of the 
headwind component, and 150% of the tailwind component.  Most performance graphs that 
calculate the landing distance have the 50% headwind and 150% tailwind recommendations 
already applied.  
An important note is that there is no allowance for crosswinds and therefore no safety factor 
for crosswinds.  Crosswinds present an additional complication because of the effect of 
potentially crossed controls which would have to be applied because the wind will tend to 
push the aeroplane off the centre line.  These issues mean that aeroplanes are given maximum 
crosswind limits.
Flap Setting
Flaps are devices used to increase the camber of the wing and generate more lift, thereby 
reducing the landing speed.  However, the use of a lot of flap will dramatically increase 
aerodynamic drag as well.  This is a benefit in landing and helps to slow the aeroplane down. 
Let us take a look at how different flap angles can affect the landing distance.
With no flap the aircraft will have a much faster approach speed, and have very little aerodynamic 
drag, therefore the landing distance will be large.  However, with some flap selected, the 
approach speed is less, there will be more aerodynamic drag and consequently the landing 
distance will be smaller.  However, with full flap, the approach speed is minimized and the 
aerodynamic drag is maximized.  Therefore, the landing distance will be least compared to 
other flap settings.  Having full flap selected for landing allows the aeroplane to maximize its 
landing mass.   However, there is a disadvantage with having full flap if there was a situation 
where the aeroplane needed to abort the landing and go-around for another attempt.  You 
will recall that large flap angles greatly deteriorate the climb performance compared to no 
flaps.  Therefore in a go-around, after the climb has been established, retract the flaps as soon 
as possible in the manner prescribed in the aeroplane flight manual.

General Principles - Landing
Runway Slope
The next factor that can affect the landing performance is the slope of the runway. Slope has 
an impact on the landing distance because of its effect on how the component of weight acts 
along the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane.  When the aircraft is on an upslope, the weight 
still acts towards the centre of the earth, but there is a component of weight which acts in 
the direction of drag, that is, backwards along the longitudinal axis.  This will increase the 
deceleration of the aeroplane and therefore decrease the landing distance.  Conversely when 
the aeroplane is on a downslope, the weight component now acts in the direction of thrust. 
This adds to the forward force, therefore it will decrease the deceleration and increase the 
landing distance.
A rough calculation to help quickly quantify the effect of slope is to assume that for every 1% 
slope, the landing distance is affected by 5%, or a factor of 1.05.  The slope at some airfields 
means that the landing may only be possible in one direction.  These are called unidirectional 
runways.  Treat these runways with extra caution and always check that the current wind 
velocity will still allow a safe landing since you may be forced to land with a tailwind.
Runway Surface
Most landing performance graphs assume a paved hard surface.  If the condition of the runway 
is not like this, then the effect on the landing distance needs to be understood and corrections 
applied.
Grass
A lot of small airfields have grass runways.  The grass will increase the drag on the wheels.  This 
is known as impingement drag and it will help to decelerate the aeroplane.   However, grass 
severely reduces the wheel friction to the runway compared to a paved runway and therefore 
the wheel cannot be retarded efficiently by the brakes, otherwise the wheel will lock and the 
wheel friction with the runway will reduce even further. 
Figure 6.6 An illustration showing that for the wheel to advance grass must be pushed out of the way
The overall effect is that grass runways will increase the landing distance. In light general 
aviation aeroplanes, this increase in landing distance is about 15% compared to a landing on a 
paved surface.  However, most landings that you will carry out throughout your professional 
career will undoubtedly be on hard paved runways.

General Principles - Landing
Contaminations
If the runway is covered partially or fully by contaminants such as standing water, snow, slush 
or ice, then pay special attention to the effect that they will have on the landing distance. 
These substances will have two main effects.  
The first effect is that they will create impingement drag, much like grass did, but more 
importantly, the second effect is that these substances will substantially reduce the friction 
between the wheel and the runway.  Therefore the wheel cannot be retarded efficiently by 
the brakes.  As a result of the reduced friction and therefore the subsequent reduced braking 
action, any contamination of the runway due to water, snow, slush or ice will significantly 
increase the landing distance.  You can see the effect of the various contaminations to the 
landing distance in Figure 6.7.
Figure 6.7 A graph showing the effect of contamination on the landing distance
Typically on a dry runway the braking coefficient of friction is between 0.8 to 1.0, but on wet, 
slippery or icy runways, the braking coefficient of friction can fall to less than 0.2.  Because of 
the lack of effective braking on slippery surfaces, the aerodynamic drag and reverse thrust 
become more important in bringing the aeroplane to a stop as shown in Figure 6.8. On flooded 
or icy runways, reverse thrust accounts for 80% of the deceleration force.

Figure 6.8 Various codes & terminology associated with runway contaminations
An important point to note is that there is a distinction between the definitions of a damp, wet 
or contaminated runway.  A runway is considered to be damp when there is moisture present on 
the surface which changes its colour, but insufficient moisture to produce a reflective surface.
A wet runway is one whose moisture level makes the runway appear reflective, but there are 
no areas of standing water in excess of 3 mm deep. Wet runways can cause the average dry 
landing distance to increase by as much as 50%.
A contaminated runway is one where more than 25% of the runway is covered in a layer 
of moisture, whose specific gravity is equivalent to a depth of 3 mm or more of water. The 
importance of runway contamination cannot be stressed enough, as many fatal accidents may 
have been avoided had due account been taken of the situation.
From what you have learnt so far it is vital that the pilot be aware of the type of runway 
contamination, its depth, its extent, its effect on the braking and of course its overall effect 
on the operation concerned, in this case, the landing. The information on the runway 
contamination and braking effect can be given to the pilot through a report.  These reports 
are either by SNOWTAM, runway state code PIREPS or spoken by air traffic control and may 
include braking action or braking coefficient.  Use any runway reports together with your 
aeroplane flight manual or standard operating procedure to best gauge the landing technique 
and landing performance.
Hydroplaning
There are three principal types of aquaplaning or hydroplaning as it is now more commonly 
known.  
Dynamic Hydroplaning
The first is dynamic hydroplaning.  When an aircraft lands fast enough on a wet runway with at 
least 3 mm of standing water, inertial effects prevent water escaping from the footprint area, 
and the tyre is buoyed or held off the pavement by hydrodynamic force.  Most people have 
experienced this type of hydroplaning when they have driven over a patch of water at high
--- Page 290 ---

General Principles - Landing
speed.  The speed at which dynamic hydroplaning occurs is called VP.  There is a simple formula 
to help calculate the dynamic hydroplaning speed.  
For rotating tyres the dynamic hydroplaning speed in knots is equal to 9 times the square root 
of the tyre pressure in psi. For a typical 737 the dynamic hydroplaning speed is between 90 and 
120 knots.
However, for non-rotating tyres the dynamic hydroplaning speed is equal to 7.7 times the 
square root of the tyre pressure.  
The danger from hydroplaning is the virtually nil braking and steering effect.  The most positive 
methods of preventing this type of hydroplaning are to groove the tyres, transversely groove 
the runway, ensure the runway pavement is convex from the centre line and ensure the runway 
has a macro-texture.
Viscous Hydroplaning
The second type of hydroplaning is called viscous hydroplaning.  It occurs because of the 
viscous properties of water acting like a lubricant. A thin film of fluid not more than 0.03 mm 
deep cannot be penetrated by the tyre in the footprint area and the tyre rolls on top of the 
film. Viscous hydroplaning can occur at a much lower speed than dynamic hydroplaning, but 
it requires a smooth surface. 
The most positive method of preventing this type of hydroplaning is to provide a micro-texture 
to the pavement surface which breaks up the film of water allowing it to collect into very small 
pockets.  This means that the tyre footprint will sit on the peaks of the textured surface and 
not the film of water. 
Reverted Rubber Hydroplaning
Reverted rubber hydroplaning is a complex phenomenon which over the years has been the 
subject of a variety of explanations.  Reverted rubber hydroplaning requires a prolonged, locked 
wheel skid, reverted rubber, and a wet runway surface.  The locked wheels create enough heat 
to vaporize the underlying water film forming a cushion of steam that lifts the tyre off the 
runway and eliminates tyre to surface contact. The steam heat reverts the rubber to a black 
gummy deposit on the runway. Once started, reverted rubber skidding will persist down to 
very low speeds, virtually until the aircraft comes to rest. During the skid there is no steering 
capability and the braking effect is almost nil.  Reverted rubber hydroplaning is greatly reduced 
in modern aeroplanes due to the standardization of advanced anti-skid braking systems which 
prevent wheel lock up.
Landing Technique on Slippery Runways
Detailed below is some advice and guidance on how to land on contaminated runways.  
Firstly, check the current weather, and the runway conditions using the most accurate 
information possible.  Once this has been done, completely reassess the landing performance 
data to ensure satisfactory compliance to the regulations.  
Ensure you are at VREF at the landing screen height and prepare to land the aircraft in the 
touchdown zone within the 1000 ft target of the airborne segment.  
Land on the centre line with minimal lateral drift and without excess speed.

General Principles - Landing
Arm auto spoilers and auto brakes as appropriate which ensures prompt stopping effort after 
touchdown.  For aeroplanes fitted with automatic anti-skid brakes, the brakes will be applied 
above the dynamic hydroplaning speed, but for aeroplanes without this system, only apply the 
brakes below the dynamic hydroplaning speed.  
The flare should lead to a firm touchdown, sometimes described as flying the aeroplane onto 
the runway.  Positive landings will help place load on the wheels which will increase braking 
effectiveness and squeeze out the water from the tyre footprint area. 
Do not allow the aeroplane to float and do not attempt to achieve a perfectly smooth 
touchdown. An extended flare will extend the touchdown point.  Soft touchdowns will delay 
wheel spin up and delay oleo compression which is needed for auto brake and auto spoiler 
activation.
After main gear touchdown, do not hold the nose wheel off the runway.  Smoothly fly the nose 
wheel onto the runway by relaxing aft control column pressure. 
Deploy spoilers as soon as possible after touchdown or confirm auto spoiler deployment.  If the 
aeroplane does not have auto brake then initiate braking once spoilers have been raised and 
nose wheel has contacted the runway.  
Apply brakes smoothly and symmetrically.
Initiate reverse thrust as soon as possible after touchdown of the main wheels and target the 
rollout to stop well short of the end of the runway. 
Leave a margin for unexpectedly low friction due to wet rubber deposits or hydroplaning.
Microbursts and Windshear
Of all the phases of flight it is the landing phase which is the most susceptible to severe weather 
conditions.  The low altitude, low speed, low thrust settings and high drag during the landing 
phase mean that the aeroplane is at its most vulnerable.  Landing when windshear is observed 
or forecast should be avoided, but if conditions are within limits, then landing at a higher 
speed should be used, but caution should be exercised since the higher landing speed will 
greatly increase the distance of the airborne section and ground roll of the landing.

General Principles - Landing
The microburst is the single most hazardous weather phenomenon to aeroplanes close to the 
ground, particularly during the landing phase.  However, there are certain clues which can give 
a pilot advance warning.  The most obvious clue to a potential microburst are the tendrils of 
rain found beneath a storm cloud which are called virga or fallstreaks.  Virga is precipitation 
falling but evaporating before it reaches the ground.
In the absence of specific guidance, here are some suggested techniques for identifying and 
dealing with a microburst encounter whilst on the approach to land.  Using Figure 6.10 you 
can see that initially there will be an increase in airspeed and a rise above the approach path 
caused by the increasing headwind.  On modern aeroplanes a windshear alert is usually given. 
This should be seen as the precursor to the microburst.  Any hope of a stabilized approach 
should be abandoned and a missed approach should be initiated.  Without hesitation the 
power should be increased to go-around power, the nose raised and the aeroplane flown in 
accordance with the missed approach procedure.  Typically the nose attitude will be about 15° 
and the control column should be held against the buffet or stick shaker.  The initial bonus of 
increased airspeed may now be rapidly eroded as the downdraught is encountered.  Airspeed 
will fall and the aeroplane may start to descend despite high power and high pitch angle.
Figure 6.10 An illustration showing the flight path of a typical aeroplane on the approach to land during a 
microburst encounter
 
The point at which the tailwind starts to be encountered may be the most critical.  The rate 
of descent may reduce, but the airspeed may continue to fall and any height loss may now 
break into obstacle clearance margins.  Maximum thrust is now usually needed and the nose 
attitude kept high on the stall warning margins to escape the effects of the tailwind.  Had 
the go-around not been initiated at the early warning stage, then it is highly unlikely that the 
aeroplane would survive the encounter. Because windshear, heavy rain, poor visibility, runway 
contamination and microbursts are hazards very closely associated with thunderstorms, it is 
advisable never to land with a thunderstorm at or in the immediate vicinity of the aerodrome. 
Delay the landing or consider diverting.  There are too many cases to list of pilots who have 
attempted to land in bad weather and they have sadly perished along with many passengers. 
Most of these occurrences were avoidable had due account been taken of the situation.

Single-engine Class B Aircraft - Take-off
Performance Class B
Just to remind yourself, single-engine Class B aeroplanes are propeller driven aeroplanes with 
a maximum approved passenger seating configuration of 9 or less, and a maximum take-off 
mass of 5700 kg or less.
CS-23 contains requirements for normal, utility, and aerobatic category aeroplanes, and also 
for commuter category aeroplanes.
General Requirements (EU-OPS 1.525)
These requirements can be found in CAP 698 on page 1 of section 2 under paragraph 1.2. 
There are four general requirements about operating single-engine Class B aeroplanes for 
commercial air transport purposes.
•	 The first is that this aeroplane shall not be operated at night.
•	 The second that the aeroplane must not be operated in instrument meteorological 
conditions (IMC) except under special visual flight rules (SVFR). 
•	 The third is that it must not be operated unless suitable surfaces are available en route 
which permit a safe forced landing to be made should engine failure occur at any point on 
the route.
•	 Lastly, that this type of aeroplane must not be operated above a cloud layer that extends 
below the relevant minimum safe altitude.  
The reason why the latter regulation exists is quite easy to understand.  If the engine were 
to fail during these conditions, it would be almost impossible for a pilot to be able to see the 
landing surface and therefore impossible for the pilot to carry out a safe forced landing.
Take-off Distance (CS-23.51 & 23.53)
The gross take-off distance for Class B aeroplanes (other than those in the commuter category) 
is the distance from the start of take-off to a screen height of 50 ft above the take-off surface, 
with take-off power set, rotating at VR and achieving the specified speed at the screen.
The rotation speed VR must not be less than VS1
The take-off safety speed (screen height speed) must be not less than the greater of:
•	 a speed that is safe under all reasonably expected conditions
or
•	 1.2VS1

Take-off Requirements / Field Length Requirements
There is only one take-off requirement for single-engine Class B aeroplanes.  The requirement 
is that the mass of the aeroplane must be such that the take-off can be completed within the 
available distances.  In other words, the take-off must be complete within the field length 
available.   This requirement is called the “Field Length Requirement”. 
The Field Length Requirements are detailed below and you can find them in CAP 698 under 
paragraph 2.1.1 of page 1 and 2 of section 2. 
•	 When no stopway or clearway is available, the take-off distance when multiplied by 1.25 
must not exceed TORA (Gross TOD × 1.25 must not exceed the TORA)
•	 When a stopway and/or clearway is available the take-off distance must:
•	 not exceed TORA (Gross TOD must not exceed the TORA)
•	 when multiplied by 1.3, not exceed ASDA (Gross TOD × 1.3 must not exceed the ASDA)
•	 when multiplied by 1.15, not exceed TODA (Gross TOD × 1.15 must not exceed the TODA)
To understand these requirements it might be easier to work through an example.  
EXAMPLE: Let us assume that the aeroplane flight manual gives the take-off distance as 
3000 ft and that there is no stopway or clearway available at the airport.  What is the net take-
off distance or the minimum length or TORA?
In this case we must satisfy the requirement that “when no stopway or clearway is available, 
the take-off distance when multiplied by 1.25 must not exceed TORA (Gross TOD × 1.25 must 
not exceed the TORA)”
To carry out the calculation, multiply 3000 ft by 1.25 which gives us a value of 3750 ft.  Essentially 
this means that the runway must be at least 3750 ft long, or, more correctly, the take-off run 
available (TORA) must be at least 3750 ft long.
Figure 7.1 The gross take-off distance multiplied by 1.25 must not exceed the TORA

Single-engine Class B Aircraft - Take-off
This rule ensures that once the aeroplane has completed the take-off, that is, at the screen 
height, there should be at least 25% of the runway remaining.  Therefore the regulation 
requirement provides an adequate safety margin for the take-off.  We discussed these safety 
concerns during the lesson on performance standards. To interpret the regulation, although 
the actual take-off distance is 3000 ft, the authorities are suggesting the worse case in a million 
would be a take-off that is 3750 ft long.  This helps us again to see the difference between net 
and gross performance.  Here the gross performance for the take-off is 3000 ft but the net 
performance, which is always worse performance, is 3750 ft.
Factors to Be Accounted for
The regulations in CS-23 state that when calculating the gross take-off distance, in other words, 
before we add the factors mentioned previously, certain details must be accounted for.  These 
are listed below. 
The gross take-off distance required shall take account of:
•	 the mass of the aeroplane at the start of the take-off run
•	 the pressure altitude at the aerodrome
•	 the ambient temperature at the aerodrome
•	 the runway surface conditions and the type of runway surface
•	 the runway slope
•	 not more than 50% of the reported headwind component or not less than 150% of the 
reported tailwind component 
Surface Condition Factors
Concentrating on runway surface, conditions and slope, the regulations stipulate that due 
account must be taken of the runway condition.  Most performance data in the aeroplane 
flight manual assumes a level, dry and hard runway.  Therefore, correction factors must be 
applied to the gross take-off distance when the runway conditions are different.  There are 
various correction factors such as for grass runways, wet runways and runways which are 
sloped.  These factors are detailed next.
At the top of page 2 section 2 under section c) in CAP 698 it states that if the runway is other 
than dry and paved the following correction factors must be used when determining the take-
off distance.  These are shown for you in Figure 7.2.

Figure 7.2 The correction factors that need to be applied to the gross take-off distance when 
the runway is other than dry and paved
As you have learnt already, grass runways will increase the take-off distance compared to 
paved runways. Here the factor to use to account for the effect of dry grass is 1.2 and 1.3 if the 
grass is wet.

Single-engine Class B Aircraft - Take-off
At the top of page 2 section 2 underneath the table, point “d” details the corrections to 
be applied if there is a slope to the runway.  It states that a pilot must increase the take-off 
distance by 5%, or by a factor of 1.05, for every 1% upslope.  However, it also states that “no 
factorization is permitted for downslope”.  In other words, when an aeroplane may be taking 
off on a downwards sloping runway no correction factor is to be applied for the downslope. 
The reason for ignoring the downslope is because a downslope will decrease the take-off 
distance.  This helps to add a little extra safety to the take-off distance calculation.
Presentation of Data
The take-off distance required is usually presented in graphical form.  You can see such a graph 
by looking at Figure 2.1 on page 3 of section 2 in CAP 698.  Firstly, the title of the graph 
indicates that the graph is for calculating the gross take-off distance with no flaps selected.  For 
other flap settings you may have to consult another graph. 
Take a look at the associated conditions paying particular notice to the power and flap settings 
as shown at the top of Figure 2.1 in CAP 698. Also notice that this graph assumes a runway that 
is paved, level and dry.  If the runway conditions required for a given calculation are different 
to those specified, then corrections will need to be made to the values this graph will give.  We 
briefly saw these correction factors earlier.  Notice a small box in the middle of the graph which 
highlights the rotation and screen height speeds for different weights.  A pilot must adhere to 
these accurately because they are the speeds which have been used to construct this graph. 
If a pilot were to deviate from these speeds, the required aircraft performance would not be 
achieved.
Having looked at the various bits of information around the graphs let us now examine the 
graph itself.  The left hand carpet of the graph involves the variations of temperature and 
pressure altitude.   This part of the graph accounts for the effect of air density on the take-off 
distance.  The middle carpet accounts for the effect of the mass and to the right of this carpet 
is the wind correction carpet.  Notice the differences in the slope of the headwind and tailwind 
lines.  This means the 150% and 50% wind rules have been applied.  The last carpet on the far 
right of the graph is labelled “obstacle height”.  Although there is no “obstacle” as such at the 
end of the take-off run, you will recall that the take-off is not complete until a screen height of 
50 ft is reached.
Using an example we will work through the graph so that you are able to see how the take-off 
distance is calculated.  For this example, follow through the red line in Figure 7.3.  
In the example we will assume a temperature of 15°C at a given airfield 4000 ft above mean 
sea level.  To use the graph then, move upwards from 15°C until you have reached the 
4000 ft pressure altitude line.  Then move right until you meet the first reference line.   The next 
variable is mass; in our example let us assume a mass of 3400 lb. From the reference line we 
must move down along the sloping guidelines until we reach 3400 lb as shown here.  From this 
point we go horizontally to the right until the next reference line.  The next variable is wind.
In our example we will assume a 10 knot headwind.  Notice though that the slopes of the 
headwind and tailwind lines are different.  We therefore recognize that the 150% tailwind 
and 50% headwind rules that you learnt about in the general principles for take-off lesson 
have already been applied.  Travel down the headwind line until you reach 10 knots headwind 
and then move horizontally right once more, up to the last reference line. Remember that the 
take-off is not complete until the aeroplane has reached the 50 ft screen height,  so from this 
point on the graph we must move up the guidelines to the end.  The take-off distance in our 
example, then, is approximately 2300 ft from brake release to the 50 ft screen.

However, let us now assume that the runway has a grass surface and that the grass is wet. 
Remember that both these variables cause an increase in the take-off distance.  Since the graph 
assumes a paved dry runway we will have to make a correction to the take-off distance for the 
different conditions.   You may recall that wet grass increases the distance by 30% or by a factor 
of 1.3.  Our calculated take-off distance was 2300 ft, but correcting it for wet grass would now 
make the take-off distance 2990 ft.  
Let us now assume the runway has an upslope of 1%.  You may recall this would increase the 
take-off distance by 5% or by a factor of 1.05.
This now makes the total gross take-off distance 3140 ft. To comply with the field length 
requirements and to obtain a net take-off distance, you may recall that the take-off distance 
must be compared to the available distances at the airfield to ensure it does not exceed the 
limits laid down by the authorities.  To remind you of these regulations turn to page 1 section 
2 in CAP 698.
Certification Requirements
The last part of the lesson will focus on some of the certification specifications for single-engine 
Class B aeroplanes.  These can be found in the document from EASA called CS-23.  There are 
only two main specifications that apply to the take-off phase of flight and these specifications 
concern the take-off speeds.
The first of these certification specifications concerns VR.  You may recall that VR is the speed 
at which the pilot makes a control input with the intention of getting the aeroplane out of 
contact with the runway.  
The certification specifications state that for the single-engine aeroplane, the speed VR must not 
be less than VS1.  VS1 being the stall speed or the minimum steady flight speed of the aeroplane 
obtained in a specified configuration.  The configuration concerned is that configuration used 
for the take-off.
The second of the certification specification concerns the speed of the aeroplane at the screen 
height.  The specifications state that the speed at 15 m or 50 ft above the take-off surface must 
be more than the higher of a speed that is safe under all reasonably expected conditions, and 
1.2VS1. You will recall from an earlier lesson that the speed that must be attained at the screen 
height is commonly referred to as the take-off safety speed.
The certification regulations about VR and the take-off safety speed are not found in CAP 698 
and therefore must be committed to memory.

Single-engine Class B - Climb
Climb Performance
The take-off climb requirements for single-engine Class B aeroplanes are stated in EU-OPS, but, 
again, as for the take-off requirements, the climb regulations can be found in CAP 698, on page 
6 of section 2.  At the top of page 6 of section 2 under point 3.1 we read that there are no 
obstacle clearance limits, or minimum acceptable climb gradients. Let us break down the two 
elements in this statement.
The regulations state that there is no requirement for a single-engine Class B aeroplane to 
demonstrate that it can clear an obstacle within the take-off flight path.   However, other classes 
of aeroplane have to demonstrate that obstacles within the take-off flight path can be cleared 
by a set limit of 50 ft or 35 ft.  It seems strange, then, that there is no regulatory requirement 
for obstacle clearance in the case of a single-engine Class B aeroplane. But, surely the idea of 
the regulations is to enforce a safety margin?  What must be understood here, though, is that 
the pilot of a single-engine Class B aeroplane must, at all times, have visual contact with the 
ground.  Consequently the pilot will at all times be able to identify the obstacle within the take-
off path and, therefore, avoid it.  However, you may judge it prudent to carry out an obstacle 
clearance calculation if there were known obstacles in the take-off flight path.
The second part of the regulation states that there is no minimum acceptable climb gradient 
for a single-engine Class B aeroplane.  Again, this seems strange; the idea of the operational 
regulations is to enforce a safety margin.  However, the reason why there is no operational 
regulation on the climb performance is that the certification specifications for this type of 
aeroplane, as stated in CS-23, are stringent enough on their own.
Even though there is no operational requirement for a minimum climb performance, it would 
not be safe to operate the aeroplane in such a manner that its performance is so poor it is barely 
able to climb.  Therefore, it is important as a pilot operating this class and type of aeroplane to 
know what climb performance would be achieved so that the aeroplane will at least be able 
to climb sufficiently.  
Presentation of Data
Provided in most pilot operating manuals or aeroplane flight manuals are climb graphs that 
help the pilot to calculate the gradient of climb.  Such a graph can be found in CAP 698 in 
section 2 page 7 figure 2.3.  As with any graphs, before you use it, ensure you are familiar with 
the associated conditions of that graph.  In this graph the throttles are at maximum, mixture is 
rich, flaps and gear are up and the cowl flaps set as required.  The climb speed for the graph is 
taken to be 100 knots indicated airspeed for all masses.
The graph has an example that you can follow using the dashed black lines so that you can 
practise on your own.  Graph accuracy is very important so try and be as careful as possible 
when using them.  Be especially careful when working out your true airspeed which is needed 
when you approach the right hand side of the graph.  You may need your navigation computer 
to do this as it might not be given to you, such as the case in the example.

Single-engine Class B - Climb
Use of the Climb Graph Data
There will be two main uses of the climb graph.  The first main use of the graph is to calculate the 
time to climb to the cruise altitude.  For this, the pilot would need to know the cruise altitude 
and the rate of climb. However, if the gradient from this graph is used for the calculation 
of obstacle clearance or the ground distance, then the gradient must be adjusted for the 
effect of wind.  This particular climb graph makes no correction for wind. The reason why 
the gradient must be corrected for wind is because obstacle clearance calculations or ground 
distance calculations use ground gradients, that is gradients measured relative to the ground 
and ground gradients are affected by wind.
If you need to refresh your memory on the difference between ground gradients and air 
gradients and the effects of wind, then go back to the general performance principles climb 
chapter. 
Examples in CAP 698
There are some example calculations in CAP 698 for you to work through and practise.  For 
example, on page 6 of section 2 there is an example on how to calculate the climb gradient 
using the graph.  Just below this, there is another example to determine what the maximum 
permissible mass is in order to achieve a 4% climb gradient.  This maximum permissible mass is 
sometimes referred to as the MAT or WAT limit.
On page 8 of section 2 is another example.  This is an example of how to calculate the horizontal 
ground distance required to climb to a given height.

Single-engine Class B - En Route and Descent
En Route Section
This chapter will focus on the single-engine Class B performance requirements for the en route 
and descent stages of flight.
Essentially the en route part of the flight is considered to be from 1500 ft above the airfield 
from which the aeroplane has taken off to 1000 ft above the destination airfield.  Although the 
CAP 698 manual does show the en route performance requirements these requirements are 
scattered through the document, which does not make for ease of reference.
En Route and Descent Requirements
EU-OPS 1.542 states that “an operator must ensure that the aeroplane, in the meteorological 
conditions expected for the flight, and in the event of engine failure, is capable of reaching 
a place at which a safe forced landing can be made.”  In order to be able to comply with the 
rule, an operator has to know certain details about the route to be flown and the performance 
of the aeroplane.  First of all, of course, for any given route, an operator must know the safe 
forced landing areas.  The next detail that the operator needs to know is whether his aeroplane 
will be able to reach these areas if the engine were to fail while en route. Whether or not this 
is possible will depend on two things;
•	 the altitude chosen for the flight 
•	 the descent gradient of the aeroplane following engine failure 
If these two parameters are known, it is possible to calculate how far the aeroplane will travel 
following engine failure.   So, let us work through an actual example.
Let us assume a cruise altitude of 10 000 ft and a gradient of descent of 7% following an engine 
failure.   What is the descent range?
We can work out the horizontal distance travelled or descent range by taking the height of the 
aeroplane above the ground, dividing this by the gradient and then multiplying by 100.
Horizontal Distance = Vertical/Gradient × 100

Single-engine Class B - En Route and Descent
In this case we see that in still air the aeroplane will cover in the glide a horizontal distance of 
142 857 ft or roughly 23.5 NM following engine failure.  This means that the aeroplane must 
not pass further away than 23.5 NM from any safe forced landing locations.  So then draw a 
circle of 23.5 NM radius, around each of the safe forced landing locations (the yellow dots) as 
you can see in Figure 9.2.  Then draw a track line from Airfield A to Airfield B that is within each 
circle.  If the flight track falls outside of the circles then, following engine failure, the aeroplane 
will not make it to a safe forced landing area.
Figure 9.2 An illustration showing the glide descent range around each forced landing area & the subsequent track 
that is required to remain within glide range of each field
If the aeroplane were to operate at a higher altitude, then it would be able to cover a greater 
distance in the glide following an engine failure.  For example, operating at 15 000 ft instead of 
10 000 ft would increase the aeroplane’s still air glide range to 35 nautical miles.  Therefore the 
circles around each forced landing location will grow as shown in Figure 9.3.

Single-engine Class B - En Route and Descent
Figure 9.3 An illustration showing the glide descent range around each forced landing area & the subsequent track 
that is required to remain within glide range of each field
Notice that now the aeroplane can fly along a straight track to airfield B because at all times 
throughout the flight, the aeroplane is within glide range of a suitable forced landing location. 
Consequently, small piston engine aeroplanes should be flown at their maximum altitudes so 
that direct routes can be achieved.  However, when planning the altitude, another regulation 
must be borne in mind. 
EU-OPS 1.542 (b) (1) states, that when complying with the safe forced landing rule the aeroplane 
must not be assumed to be flying with the engine operating at maximum continuous power 
at an altitude exceeding that at which the aeroplane’s rate of climb equals 300 ft per minute. 
What this rules effectively does, is to limit the maximum altitude that can be used in order to 
comply with the forced landing rule.   An aeroplane may operate at a higher altitude than this 
regulation prescribes but the operator may not use the higher altitude in his calculation of 
glide range to a safe landing area.

Single-engine Class B - En Route and Descent
There is one last detail to be considered about complying with the forced landing rule.  EU-
OPS 1.542 (b) (2) states, that in order to comply with the safe forced landing rule the assumed 
en route gradient shall be the gross gradient of descent, increased by a gradient of 0.5%.  In 
our example we had a gradient of descent of 7%, unfortunately though, as we have seen, the 
regulations do not permit this gradient to be used in our calculation.  The gradient must be 
increased by 0.5% to 7.5% as shown in Figure 9.4.
Figure 9.4 An illustration showing an example descent range calculation
This will lower the assumed descent performance of the aeroplane.  The new deteriorated 
gradient that the regulations insist we use is called the net gradient, and in our case this is 7.5%. 
If this net gradient has to be used, the glide distance will reduce to 22 NM.  So, although the 
aeroplane may achieve 23.5 NM following an engine failure, it must be assumed to glide only 
22 nautical miles. 
Looking at Figure 9.5, this means that the circles around each safe landing area must reduce 
to a radius of 22 NM.

Figure 9.5 An illustration showing the net track that is required to remain within net glide range of each safe forced 
landing area
Thus the planned track will have to change slightly so that at all points along the route, the 
aeroplane is no further than 22 NM from a safe forced landing area.  The track shown in Figure 
9.5 meets the entire set of requirements as stated in EU-OPS.
Information in CAP 698
It was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter that CAP 698 has the en route regulations 
in it for you, but that they were scattered through the manual and not conveniently collected 
in one place.
On page 1 of section 2 in the general requirement paragraph, point c) is the regulation about 
ensuring that the aeroplane is not operated unless surfaces are available which permit a safe 
forced landing to be carried out in the event of engine failure.  However, the other regulations 
about complying with this rule are a few pages further on.  You will find the remaining en 
route requirements at the bottom of page 8 of section 2.  
The first part of the regulations to be found here states that the aeroplane may not be assumed 
to be flying above the altitude at which a rate of climb of 300 feet per minute can be achieved. 
Underneath that rule you can see the requirement which states that the net gradient of 
descent, in the event of engine failure, is the gross gradient + 0.5%.
Although the concepts of range and endurance have been covered in a previous lesson, it is 
important for the pilot to be able to use the information in the aeroplane flight manual so that 
he may calculate the range and endurance of the aeroplane.  In the aircraft manual there are

graphs and tables which help you calculate the endurance and range of your aeroplane under 
various conditions.  
Typical Range and Endurance Graphs
Shown in Figure 9.6 is a typical endurance graph for a light single-engine Class B aeroplane. As 
an example let us assume a cruise altitude of 7000 ft with an outside air temperature of 7°C at 
65% power.  Working through the graph hopefully you see that the endurance of the aircraft 
allowing 45 minutes of reserve fuel is 6.6 hours, or 7.4 hours allowing for no reserves.

Single-engine Class B - Landing
Landing Requirement
This lesson will focus on the single-engine Class B performance requirements for the landing 
stage of flight.  There is actually only one regulation requirement for landing a single-engine 
Class B aeroplane.  This requirement is that the landing distance must not exceed the landing 
distance available.  In other words, the aeroplane must be able to land within the length of the 
runway.  In order to comply with this regulation, certain points must be taken into account. 
These will all be discussed in this lesson.
As with other regulations we have dealt with in this course, the requirements relevant to the 
landing of single-engine Class B aeroplanes can be found in CAP 698.  EU-OPS states that an 
operator must ensure that the landing mass of the aeroplane, for the estimated time of arrival, 
allows a full stop landing from 50 ft above the threshold within 70% of the landing distance 
available at the destination aerodrome and at any alternate aerodrome.   This means that the 
aeroplane must be able to land within 70% of the landing distance available.  The factor to use 
for such calculation is 1.43.
Example Landing Requirement
To help clarify this, let us work through an example and use Figure 10.1. If the landing distance 
available at the destination airfield is 2200 ft, then obviously the aeroplane must be able to 
land within 70% of 2200 ft.  To calculate this value, we must divide 2200 ft by a factor of 1.43. 
Carrying out this simple calculation, gives us an answer of 1538 ft.  1538 ft is 70% of 2200 ft. 
Therefore, the aeroplane must be able to achieve a full stop landing within 1538 ft.  
Figure 10.1 An illustration showing that the aeroplane must demonstrate it can come to a full stop within 70% of 
the landing distance available
There is another way to look at the landing requirement.  If the landing distance of the 
aeroplane is calculated to be 1200 ft, what is the minimum length of the landing distance 
available which will allow a pilot to comply with the 70% rule?  
Use Figure 10.2 to help. In this case we simply multiply 1200 ft by 1.43.  This gives us an answer
--- Page 334 ---
Single-engine Class B - Landing
10
204
10
Single-engine Class B - Landing
of 1716 ft.  Therefore, the landing distance available must be at least 1716 ft long.  If the 
destination aerodrome has a runway with a landing distance available in excess of 1716 ft, 
the aeroplane will be able to land within 70% of the landing distance available and therefore 
satisfy the regulation requirement.
Figure 10.2 To obtain the minimum length of runway required, multiply the gross landing distance by 1.43.
The 70% landing regulation helps us to see the difference between net and gross performance. 
The gross performance is 1200 ft, but the net performance, which is always worse than the 
gross performance and is the one in a million worse case scenario, is 1716 ft. 
The landing regulation we have just been discussing can be found in CAP 698 in section 2 at the 
top of page 9.  The regulation states that the landing distance, from a screen height of 50 ft, 
must not exceed 70% of the landing distance available. If the aeroplane cannot come to a full 
stop within this length, then the landing distance must be reduced, either by selecting a higher 
flap setting or simply by reducing the mass of the aeroplane.
Factors to Be Accounted for
The regulations in CS-23 state that when calculating the gross landing distance, certain details 
must be accounted for.  These are listed below. 
The gross landing distance shall take account of:
•	 the pressure altitude at the aerodrome
•	 standard temperature
•	 the runway surface conditions and the type of runway surface
•	 the runway slope
•	 not more than 50% of the reported headwind component or not less than 150% of the 
reported tailwind component
•	 the despatch rules for scheduled or planned landing calculations EU-OPS 1.550 (c).

Single-engine Class B - Landing
Correction Factors
Having discussed the regulation requirements detailing the maximum landing distance that 
must be available at a destination airfield or alternate airfield, we will now examine in detail 
the regulations governing how the gross landing distance is calculated given non-standard 
conditions like grass runways, wet runways and sloping runways.
Grass
In CAP 698 section 2, at the top of page 9 under point (b) we read that if the runway is of grass 
up to 20 cm high, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1.15.  This would 
increase the landing distance by 15%. 
Wet
If there is an indication that the runway may be wet at the estimated time of arrival, the 
landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1.15.  Again, multiplying the calculated 
landing distance by a factor of 1.15 will increase the landing distance by 15%.  If the aeroplane 
manual gives additional information on landing on wet runways, this may be used even if it 
gives a lesser distance than that from the above paragraph.
Slope
Point (d) in CAP 698 section 2 page 9 states that no allowance is permitted for upslope.  The 
reason for this is that upslope will reduce the landing distance.  If a pilot were to ignore the 
reduction in the landing distance then a margin of safety would be incorporated into the 
landing distance calculation.  The landing distance should be increased by 5% for each 1% 
downslope. This means that for a 1% downslope the landing distance should be multiplied by 
a factor of 1.05.  Therefore for a 2% downslope the factor would be 1.1. 
Despatch Rules
Lastly, point (e) states that there must be compliance with the despatch rules for scheduled or 
planned landing calculations and that these can be found in EU-OPS 1.550 (c).
The despatch rules, found in EU-OPS 1.550 (c), state that for despatching an aeroplane, it must 
be assumed that:
•	 The aeroplane will land on the most favourable runway at the destination airfield in still air, 
and
•	 The aeroplane will land on the runway most likely to be assigned considering the probable 
wind speed and direction.
If this second assumption cannot be met, the aeroplane may be despatched only if an alternate 
aerodrome is designated at which full compliance of the regulatory despatch requirements can 
be met.
The first assumption is that the aeroplane will land on the most favourable runway, in still air or 
zero wind. This means that, assuming zero wind at the destination airfield, the runway which 
would accommodate the largest possible landing mass would be selected since that is the most 
favourable runway.
--- Page 336 ---
Single-engine Class B - Landing

Single-engine Class B - Landing
Using an example which you see in Figure 10.3, firstly we try and understand the first rule. 
Assuming zero wind and focusing on the column “STILL AIR MASS”, runway 04 and runway 
22 both allow a maximum landing mass of 1500 kg but runway 31 and runway 13, being 
much shorter runways, allow a maximum landing mass of only 1000 kg.  Therefore, the most 
favourable runway in still air is either runway 04 or 22, which both allow a maximum landing 
mass of 1500 kg.  These two masses have been highlighted in red.
Figure 10.3 An illustration showing example landing masses of an aeroplane based upon no wind & the forecast 
wind condition
The second despatch assumption is that the aeroplane will actually land on the most likely 
runway to be assigned considering the probable wind speed and direction.  Now focus on the 
second column “FORECAST WIND MASS”.  In this case, runway 04 has a strong headwind for 
the landing which will allow the aeroplane to land at a much greater mass than if there were 
no wind.  In our example the headwind has increased the maximum landing mass to 1750 kg. 
However, runway 22 has a tailwind, which will decrease the maximum landing mass to 800 kg. 
Runway 31 and runway 13 both have a full cross wind; therefore, the maximum landing mass 
for these two runways will be the same as for still air. If the second despatch assumption is 
that the aeroplane will land on the runway most likely to be assigned considering the probable 
wind speed and direction, then it would have to be runway 04 with a maximum landing mass 
of 1750 kg.   This mass is highlighted in red.
In summary then, the first assumption requires that the pilot select runway 04 or 22 for a 
maximum still air landing mass of 1500 kg, and the second assumption will require the pilot to 
select runway 04 for a maximum landing mass of 1750 kg.  
Now we need to consider what to use as the despatch mass of the aeroplane.  If the aeroplane 
was despatched at 1750 kg mass, and then on arrival at the airfield the wind was less than 15 
knots, the aeroplane would not be able to land.  Therefore, the aeroplane must be despatched 
with a mass of 1500 kg.  Despatching the aeroplane with this mass would mean that, no matter 
what wind conditions prevail at the destination airfield, the aeroplane will have a mass which 
will allow it to land at the airfield.

Single-engine Class B - Landing
The way to simplify the despatch rule is to always consider the greatest mass in still air and 
the greatest mass in the forecast wind conditions and, of the two, take the lesser mass as the 
despatch mass.  Of the two, it is the still air mass that is usually the lesser mass, as shown in our 
example.  The exception is when there is a tailwind on a unidirectional runway.  A unidirectional 
runway is a runway whose direction for take-off and landing is fixed in one direction.  And in 
this case the maximum landing mass in the tailwind will be less than the maximum landing 
mass in still air.
Reference Landing Speed (VREF)
You may recall that the regulatory speed at the landing screen height is called VREF and, for a 
single-engine Class B aeroplane it had to be no less than 1.3 times the stall speed in the landing 
configuration, (1.3VS0).  A pilot must adhere to the VREF speeds because they are the speeds 
which have been used to construct the landing graphs or table in the aeroplane flight manual. 
If a pilot were to deviate from these speeds, the required aircraft performance would not be 
achieved.
Presentation of Landing Data / Using the Graphs
This part of the chapter will deal with how the aeroplane’s landing distance can actually be 
calculated.  All aeroplanes will have either a pilot operating handbook or an aeroplane flight 
manual.  The purpose of these manuals is not only to show how to operate the aeroplane but 
also to detail the aeroplane’s performance. 
The example graph we will use is figure 2.4 on page 10 of section 2 in CAP 698.  Always take 
a look at the associated conditions first, paying particular attention to the power and flap 
settings as shown at the top of the graph. Also notice that this graph assumes a runway which 
is paved, level and dry.  If the runway conditions required for a given calculation are different 
to those specified, corrections will need to be made to the values that this graph will give.  We 
saw these correction factors earlier.  
The left hand carpet of the graph involves the variations in temperature and pressure altitude. 
This part of the graph accounts for the effect of air density on the landing distance.  The 
middle carpet accounts for the effect of the mass and to the right of this carpet is the wind 
correction carpet.  Notice the differences in the slope of the headwind and tailwind lines.  This 
means the 150% and 50% wind rules have been applied.  The last carpet on the far right of the 
graph is labelled “obstacle height”.  Although there is no “obstacle” as such you will recall that 
the landing starts at a height of 50 ft above the landing surface.
Follow through the example that has been carried out for you in the graph.  This will help you 
to use the graph correctly.   Not only is there an example on the graph itself, but if you look 
at the bottom of page 9 of section 2 in CAP 698 you will see another example which you can 
work through.   Use the examples; they are there to help you.  If you need practice on working 
through the graphs, use the questions at the end of the chapter.

Multi-engine Class B - Take-off
Take-off Requirements
The take-off requirements for multi-engine Class B aircraft (other than those in the commuter 
category) are the same as for single-engine aircraft except that multi-engine Class B aeroplanes 
must additionally demonstrate a minimum climb gradient performance and an obstacle 
clearance capability.
Gradient Requirement EU-OPS 1.530
Three climb gradient requirements must be considered, and the most limiting will determine 
the maximum permissible mass.  You can find these in CAP 698 under paragraph 3.1.2 on page 
9 of section 3.
•	 ALL ENGINES OPERATING
A minimum climb gradient of 4% is required with:
•	 take-off power on each engine
•	 landing gear extended, except that if the landing gear can be retracted in not more than 
7 seconds, it may be assumed to be retracted
•	 the wing flaps in the take-off position
•	 a climb speed of not less than the greater of 1.1VMC and 1.2VS1
•	 ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE
The climb gradient at an altitude of 400 ft above the take-off surface must be measurably 
positive with:
•	 the critical engine inoperative and its propeller in the minimum drag position
•	 the remaining engine at take-off power
•	 the landing gear retracted
•	 the wing flaps in the take-off position
•	 a climb speed equal to that achieved at 50 ft
The climb gradient must not be less than 0.75% at an altitude of 1500 ft above the take-off 
surface, with:
•	 the critical engine inoperative and its propeller in the minimum drag position
•	 the remaining engine at not more than maximum continuous power 
•	 the landing gear retracted 
•	 the wing flaps retracted 
•	 a climb speed not less than 1.2VS1

Field Length Requirements
The Field Length Requirements are the same as for the single-engine aeroplane and are detailed 
below.  You can also find them in CAP 698 under paragraph 2.1.1 of pages 1 and 2 of section 3. 
•	 When no stopway or clearway is available, the take-off distance when multiplied by 1.25 
must not exceed TORA (Gross TOD × 1.25 must not exceed the TORA)
•	 When a stopway and/or clearway is available the take-off distance must:
•	 not exceed TORA (Gross TOD must not exceed the TORA)
•	 when multiplied by 1.3, not exceed ASDA (Gross TOD × 1.3 must not exceed the ASDA)
•	 when multiplied by 1.15, not exceed TODA (Gross TOD × 1.15 must not exceed the TODA)
Factors to Be Accounted for
The regulations in CS-23 state that when calculating the gross take-off distance, in other words, 
before we add the factors mentioned previously, certain details must be accounted for.  These 
are listed below. 
The gross take-off distance required shall take account of:
•	 the mass of the aeroplane at the start of the take-off run
•	 the pressure altitude at the aerodrome
•	 the ambient temperature at the aerodrome
•	 the runway surface conditions and the type of runway surface
•	 the runway slope
•	 not more than 50% of the reported headwind component or not less than 150% of the 
reported tailwind component 
Surface Condition Factors
From the list above, the regulations stipulate that due account must be made of the runway 
condition.  Most performance data in the aeroplane flight manual assumes a level, dry and 
hard runway.  Therefore, correction factors must be applied to the gross take-off distance 
when the runway conditions are different.  There are various correction factors such as for 
grass runways, wet runways and runways which are sloped.  These factors are detailed next.
At the top of page 2 section 2 under paragraph c) in CAP 698 it states that if the runway is 
other than dry and paved the following correction factors must be used when determining the 
take-off distance.  These are shown for you in Figure 11.1.

Figure 11.1 
As you have learnt already, grass runways will increase the take-off distance compared to 
paved runways.  Here the factor to use to account for the effect of dry grass is 1.2 and 1.3 if 
the grass is wet.
At the top of page 2 section 3, point d) details the corrections to be applied if there is a slope 
to the runway.  It states that a pilot must increase the take-off distance by 5%, or by a factor 
of 1.05, for every 1% upslope.  However, it also states that “no factorization is permitted for 
downslope”.  In other words, when an aeroplane may be taking off on a downwards sloping 
runway no correction factor is to be applied for the downslope.  The reason for ignoring the 
downslope is because a downslope will decrease the take-off distance.  This helps to add a little 
extra safety to the take-off distance calculation.
Presentation of Take-off Data
Shown in CAP 698 on pages 3 and 7 of section 3 are the take-off distance graphs for a typical 
multi-engine Class B aeroplane.  The one on page 3 is “normal take-off” and the one on page 7 
is a “maximum effort” take-off, in other words a short field take-off.  There are several examples 
in CAP 698, one at the bottom of page 2 and the other at the top of page 6 in section 3.  Ensure 
you go through these examples to help you with your graph work and to help you to know 
when to apply the various factors.
Accelerate-stop Distance Requirements
Other than for commuter category aircraft, there is no requirement for accelerate-stop distance, 
but the data may be given.  Shown in CAP 698 on pages 5 and 8 of section 3 you can see the 
accelerate-stop distance graphs for a typical multi-engine Class B aeroplane.  As with other 
graphs, there are examples which you should go through.
For commuter category aircraft, the accelerate-stop distance is the sum of the distances 
necessary to:
•	 accelerate the aircraft to VEF with all engines operating
•	 accelerate from VEF to V1 assuming the critical engine fails at VEF
•	 come to a full stop from the point at which V1 is reached
Take-off Speeds
The gross take-off distance required is the distance from the start of take-off to a point 50 ft 
above the take-off surface, with take-off power on each engine, rotating at VR and achieving 
the specified speed at the screen.

Multi-engine Class B - Take-off
VR	
The rotation speed, must not be less than:
•	 1.05VMC
•	 1.1VS1
The speed at 50 ft (the take-off safety speed) must not be less than:
•	 a speed that is safe under all reasonably expected conditions
•	 1.1VMC
•	 1.2VS1
VMC for take-off must not exceed 1.2VS1
These speeds are not found in CAP 698 and must be committed to memory.
Obstacle Clearance Requirements (EU-OPS 1.535)
Multi-engine Class B aircraft must demonstrate clearance of obstacles after take-off up to 
a height of 1500 ft.  All the obstacle clearance requirements can be found in CAP 698 and 
therefore they do not need to be learnt.  You can find them all on page 9 of section 3.
Obstacles must be cleared by:
•	 a vertical margin of at least 50 ft or
•	 a horizontal distance of at least 90 m + 0.125D where D is the distance from the end of 
the TODA, or the end of the TOD if a turn is scheduled before the end of the TODA. For 
aeroplanes with a wingspan of less than 60 m the horizontal distance may be taken as 60 m 
+ half the wingspan + 0.125D.
The following conditions must be assumed:
•	 the flight path begins at a height of 50 ft above the surface at the end of the TODR and 
ends at a height of 1500 ft above the surface.
•	 the aeroplane is not banked before it has reached the height of 50 ft, and thereafter that 
the angle of bank does not exceed 15°.
•	 failure of the critical engine occurs at the point on the all engine take-off flight path where 
visual reference for the purpose of avoiding obstacles is expected to be lost.
•	 the gradient to be assumed from 50 ft  to the point of engine failure is equal to the average 
all engine gradient during climb and transition to the en route configuration, multiplied by 
a factor of 0.77.
•	 the gradient from the point of engine failure to 1500 ft is equal to the one engine inoperative 
en route gradient.

Multi-engine Class B - Take-off
If the flight path does not require track changes of more then 15°, obstacles do not need to 
be considered if the lateral distance is greater than 300 m if in VMC or 600 m for  all  other 
conditions.  If the flight path requires track changes of more than 15°, obstacles need not be 
considered if the lateral distance is greater than 600 m in VMC or 900 m for all other conditions.
Take-off Flight Path
The flight path profile performance should take account of:
•	 the mass of the aeroplane at the commencement of the take-off run
•	 the pressure altitude at the aerodrome
•	 the ambient temperature
•	 not more than 50% of the reported headwind component and not less than 150% of the 
reported tailwind component
Construction of the Flight Path
The flight path profile will depend on whether or not visual reference is lost before reaching 
1500 ft.
•	 VISIBILITY CLEAR TO 1500 ft
•	 Determine the TOD required for the take-off mass
•	 Determine the all engines net gradient (gross gradient × 0.77)
•	 Divide the height gain (1450 ft) by the gradient  to determine the distance travelled 
(feet) from 50 ft to 1500 ft.
•	 The profile may be plotted as shown in Figure 11.2 and clearance of obstacles assessed.

Multi-engine Class B - Take-off
Alternatively for a single obstacle, find the TOD req. and gradient as above, then multiply the 
distance from reference zero to the obstacle by the gradient to find the height gain, and add 
50 ft to find the aeroplane height at the obstacle distance.  This must exceed the obstacle 
height by 50 ft.
If the obstacle is not cleared by 50 ft, a lower take-off mass must be assumed and a revised 
height calculated.  The maximum mass which will just clear the obstacle by 50 ft can then be 
determined by interpolation.
•	 CLOUD BASE BELOW 1500 ft
If visual reference is lost before 1500 ft, the flight path will consist of two segments.
Segment 1 (From 50 ft to cloud base)
Distance from 50 ft to cloud base = height gain ÷ all engine net gradient × 100
Height gain = cloud base - 50 ft 
Segment 2 (From cloud base to 1500 ft)
Distance = height gain ÷ gross gradient with one engine inoperative × 100
The profile may be plotted as shown in Figure 11.3 and clearance of obstacles assessed. If the 
required clearance is not achieved, a reduced take-off mass must be assumed and a second 
flight path calculated.  As  before,  the  maximum  permissible  weight  may  be  determined 
by interpolation.

If the climb data is given in terms of rate of climb, this can be converted to gradient:
Gradient% = Rate of Climb (ft/min) ÷ Aircraft True Ground Speed × 100
Alternatively the time on each segment can be calculated:
Time (mins) = Height Gain (ft) ÷ Rate of Climb (ft/min)
and the distance on each segment obtained from:
Distance (ft) = Aircraft True Ground Speed (ft/min) × Time (min)

Multi-engine Class B - En Route and Descent
En Route Requirements
This chapter will focus on the multi-engine Class B  performance requirements for the en route 
and descent stages of flight.  The en route part of the flight is considered to be from 1500 ft 
above the airfield from which the aeroplane has taken off, to 1000 ft above the destination 
airfield.
As with all the other requirements we have come across, the en route and descent requirements 
are written in EU-OPS and incorporated into CAP 698.  
Looking at CAP 698 at the top of page 17 of section 3 you can see the en route requirements. 
The first sentence simply reminds you what the en route stage of flight is.  These requirements 
are listed below.
•	 An operator shall ensure that the aeroplane, in the meteorological conditions expected for 
the flight, and in the event of the failure of one engine, with the remaining engines operating 
within the maximum continuous power conditions specified, is capable of continuing flight 
at or above the relevant minimum altitudes for safe flight stated in the operations manual 
to a point 1000 ft above an aerodrome at which the performance requirements for landing 
can be met.
This requirement is almost identical to the single-engine aeroplane, the only difference being 
that whereas the single-engine aeroplane has to be capable of landing in a suitable field after 
engine failure, the multi-engine aeroplane must be capable of a higher performance level and 
therefore continue flight and land at a suitable airfield.  Therefore, in the event of engine 
failure, the multi-engine aeroplane should have a level of performance such that it can, even 
with an engine failure, get to an airfield to land.  However, as with other requirements we have 
covered, the en route requirements do have some compliance rules.  In fact, these compliance 
rules are very similar to the ones we mentioned in the single-engine en route lesson.
In order for the pilot to be able to abide by the regulation, the descent range with one engine 
inoperative must be known as well as the one engine inoperative cruise range.  Once these 
have been calculated, a flight track must be plotted that will ensure an airfield is always within 
the total one engine inoperative descent distance.  Herein lies the compliance rules because the 
compliance rules relate to how that descent range is calculated.
•	 When showing compliance with the rules shown above:
•	 The aeroplane must not be assumed to be flying at an altitude exceeding that at which 
the rate of climb equals 300 ft/min with all engines operating within the maximum 
continuous power conditions specified; and
•	 The assumed en route gradient with one engine inoperative shall be the gross gradient 
of descent or climb, as appropriate, respectively increased by a gradient of 0.5%, or 
decreased by a gradient of 0.5%.
What the first compliance rule means is that the aeroplane must not use the extra altitude 
above the 300 feet per minute altitude to gain extra range to help comply with landing at an 
airfield after engine failure.

Multi-engine Class B -En Route and Descent
The second compliance rule is saying that when calculating the descent range to work out if 
the aeroplane can make it to an airfield, the gross gradient of descent must be increased by 
0.5%.  This adjusted gradient is the net gradient and it is simply adding a safety margin into the 
aeroplanes descent range.  In this case an airfield must be within the net descent range and 
not the gross descent range.
The Drift Down
Calculating the descent range of a twin-engine aeroplane after engine failure is not as easy as it 
was for the single-engine aeroplane.  For the single-engine aeroplane, to calculate the descent 
range it was simply the height of the aeroplane divided by the descent gradient and multiplied 
by 100.  
However, the gradient of descent of a twin-engine aeroplane following engine failure is 
constantly changing.  Let us explain why. In straight and level flight the forward force of thrust 
balances the rearward force of drag.  When the engine fails, there is more rearward force than 
forward force, and, as a result of the excess drag the aeroplane will slow down if level flight is 
maintained.  To maintain the speed, which should be kept at VMD, the thrust force generated by 
the remaining live engine must be augmented so that the forces can once again be balanced. 
Figure 12.1 The forces on an aeroplane in the early part of the drift down
The only way to do this is to lower the nose so that weight can act forward and provide enough 
weight apparent thrust to balance the excess drag.  If the nose is lowered by a sufficient amount 
then the forces will once again balance and VMD can be maintained.  The only side effect is 
that the aeroplane is descending.  However, as the aeroplane descends in the atmosphere, 
the air density increases.  This means that the thrust being produced by the remaining engine 
increases which reduces the excess drag.  Now there is no need for so much weight apparent 
thrust since the excess drag has reduced.  To reduce the amount of weight apparent thrust, 
the nose is raised a little.

Multi-engine Class B - En Route and Descent
This process can continue until the remaining engine generates sufficient thrust to balance the 
drag without any need for weight apparent thrust.  At the altitude where this balance occurs 
the aeroplane is able to level off.  
In summary then, after engine failure in the cruise, the aeroplane is forced to descend, but as it 
descends the aeroplane can slowly reduce the descent angle until the aeroplane can once more 
fly level.  This procedure is known as the drift down procedure and it produces a drift down 
flight profile similar to the one shown in Figure 12.2.
Figure 12.2 The drift down profile split into manageable segments for easy calculation of the descent range
Construction of the Drift Down Profile
It was stated that calculating the descent range for a twin-engine aeroplane after engine 
failure was complicated, and the reason, which is now hopefully apparent, is that the descent 
gradient or descent angle is constantly changing.   In the absence of a drift down graph, the 
only feasible way of calculating the descent range is to break down the profile into manageable 
segments and carry out several calculations, as shown in Figure 12.2.
Each of these calculations will need the net descent gradient at that attitude and the vertical 
interval of that segment.  This will give the horizontal distance covered for that segment.  To 
find the descent range, simply add all the horizontal distances in all the segments. After the 
descent range has been calculated and the aeroplane is able to fly straight and level, the last 
thing to do is find out the one engine inoperative cruise range.   Once this is known, it can be 
added to the descent range of the drift down profile to give the total range of the aeroplane 
following engine failure.  Therefore, at any point along the flight there must be an airfield 
at which a landing can be made within the range of the aeroplane after engine failure.  To 
ensure this, a circle, whose radius is the total single-engine range, is drawn around each airfield 
between the departure and destination points.  To comply with the regulations, the aeroplane 
track must fall inside these circles.  In doing so the aeroplane will comply with EU-OPS which 
states that in the event of engine failure the aeroplane is capable of continuing flight to an 
aerodrome where a landing can be made.

Multi-engine Class B - Landing
Landing Requirements
This chapter will focus on the multi-engine Class B performance requirements for the landing 
stage of flight.  There are two main regulation requirements.
1) The first requirement is that the landing distance must not exceed the landing distance 
available.  In other words, the aeroplane must be able to land within the length of the runway. 
This requirement can be called the landing distance requirement.
2) The second requirement is that should the aeroplane be unable to land, it must be able to 
climb away from the aerodrome with an adequate climb gradient.  This latter requirement can 
be called the landing climb requirement.
As with other regulations we have dealt with, the requirements relevant to the landing of 
multi-engine Class B aeroplanes can be found in CAP 698.  However, caution must be exercised 
since CAP 698 contains very abbreviated versions of the requirements and therefore may 
be misleading. CAP 698 is, after all, supposed to contain supplementary information for 
examination purposes only.
Landing Climb Requirements / Gradient Requirement
If, for whatever reason, a landing was not possible, then the aeroplane should have a level of 
performance that would enable it to climb safely away from the airfield.  This must be possible 
with either both engines operating or with one engine inoperative.
The landing climb requirements originate from the certification specification rules in CS-23 but 
are adopted in a brief format into EU-OPS 1.  EU-OPS 1 divides the landing climb requirements 
into all engines operating and one engine inoperative.  You can find these requirements in CAP 
698 at the bottom of page 17 and the top of page 18 of section 3 so you do not need to commit 
these requirements to memory.
All Engines Operating / Baulked Landing Requirement
With all engines operating, the steady gradient of climb must be at least 2.5%.  This gradient 
must be achieved with:
•	 The power developed 8 seconds after moving the power controls to the take-off position.
•	 The landing gear (undercarriage) extended.
•	 Flaps at the landing setting.
•	 Climb speed equal to VREF.
Note:  In order to demonstrate this climb capability for certification and for operational purposes, 
the undercarriage is assumed to be extended and the wing flaps in the landing position.
--- Page 368 ---
Multi-engine Class B - Landing

238
13
Multi-engine Class B - Landing
One Engine Inoperative / Missed Approach Requirements
With the critical engine inoperative, the gradient of climb must not be less than 0.75% at an 
altitude of 1500 ft above the landing surface.  This gradient must be achieved with:
•	 the critical engine inoperative and the propeller feathered
•	 the live engine set at maximum continuous power
•	 the landing gear (undercarriage) retracted
•	 the flaps retracted
•	 climb speed not less than 1.2VS1 
Notice this time that in order to demonstrate this climb capability for certification and for 
operational purposes, the undercarriage and wing flaps are assumed to be retracted.  The 
reason that the critical engine inoperative gradient requirement is much less than the all engine 
climb gradient requirement and that the aeroplane configuration is cleaner is because the 
failure of the critical engine results in an approximate 75% loss of climb gradient.  Setting too 
high a level of regulation would impact on the operational capability of the aeroplane in terms 
of its payload because if the aeroplane is unable to attain these gradients, then the weight of 
the aeroplane must be reduced to an amount which can allow the gradient requirements to 
be met.  
The term used to describe the maximum mass that can be carried and still attain the minimum 
gradient is called the Landing Climb Limit Mass.
The climb gradient requirements mentioned here are specific to aeroplanes in the normal, 
utility and aerobatic category of more than 2722 kg and therefore only represent a portion of 
the requirements for multi-engine Class B aeroplanes.
An example of a landing climb performance graph is on page 19 of section 3 in CAP 698. 
This graph is for the baulked landing, in other words an all engine full power go-around. 
However, notice that the graph only gives you a rate of climb.  Therefore, in order to know if 
the aeroplane is achieving the minimum required gradient of 2.5% you must convert the rate 
of the climb into a gradient.  An example of such a calculation is shown for you at the bottom 
of page 18 of section 3 in CAP 698.
Landing Distance Requirements EU-OPS 1.550
The landing distance requirements for multi-engine Class B aircraft are the same as for single-
engine aircraft (see Chapter 10). You can see these requirements in CAP 698 in the middle of 
page 17 of section 3.
EU-OPS 1.550  states that an operator must ensure that the landing mass of the aeroplane, 
for the estimated time of arrival, allows a full stop landing from 50 ft above the threshold 
within 70% of the landing distance available at the destination aerodrome and at any alternate 
aerodrome.
This means that the aeroplane must be able to land within 70% of the landing distance 
available.  The factor to use for such calculations is 1.43.

Multi-engine Class B - Landing
Factors to Be Accounted for
The regulations in CS-23 state that when calculating the gross landing distance, certain details 
must be accounted for.  These are listed below. 
The gross landing distance shall take account of:
•	 the pressure altitude at the aerodrome
•	 standard temperature
•	 the runway surface conditions and the type of runway surface
•	 the runway slope
•	 not more than 50% of the reported headwind component or not less than 150% of the 
reported tailwind component
•	 the despatch rules for scheduled or planned landing calculations EU-OPS 1.550 (c).
Correction Factors
Having discussed the regulation requirements detailing the maximum landing distance that 
must be available at a destination airfield or alternate airfield, we will now examine in detail 
the regulations governing how the gross landing distance is calculated given non-standard 
conditions like grass runways, wet runways and sloping runways.
Grass
In CAP 698 section 3, in the middle of page 17 under point (b), we read that if the runway is 
of grass up to 20 cm high on firm soil, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 
1.15.  This would increase the landing distance by 15%. 
Wet
Point (c) states that if there is an indication that the runway may be wet at the estimated time 
of arrival, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1.15.  Again, multiplying the 
calculated landing distance by a factor of 1.15 will increase the landing distance by 15%.  If the 
aeroplane manual gives additional information on landing on wet runways, this may be used 
even if it gives a lesser distance than that from the above paragraph.
Slope
Point (d) states that the landing distance should be increased by 5% for each 1% downslope. 
This means that for a 1% downslope the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor 
of 1.05.  Therefore for a 2% downslope the factor would be 1.1.  Point (d) also states that no 
allowance is permitted for upslope.  The reason for this is that upslope will reduce the landing 
distance.  If a pilot were to ignore the reduction in the landing distance then a margin of safety 
would be incorporated into the landing distance calculation.
Despatch Rules
Lastly, point (e) states that there must be compliance with the despatch rules for scheduled or 
planned landing calculations and that these can be found in EU-OPS 1.550 (c). The despatch
--- Page 370 ---
Multi-engine Class B - Landing
13
240
13
Multi-engine Class B - Landing
rules, found in EU-OPS 1.550 (c), state that for despatching an aeroplane, it must be assumed 
that:
1) the aeroplane will land on the most favourable runway at the destination airfield in still air, 
and
2) the aeroplane will land on the runway most likely to be assigned considering the probable 
wind speed and direction.
If this second assumption cannot be met, the aeroplane may be despatched only if an alternate 
aerodrome is designated at which full compliance of the regulatory despatch requirements can 
be met.
Reference Landing Speed (VREF)
You may recall that the regulatory speed at the landing screen height is called VREF, and for a 
single-engine Class B aeroplane it had to be no less than 1.3 times the stall speed in the landing 
configuration, (1.3VS0). A multi-engine aeroplane must also be above VMCL during the approach 
and landing phase to ensure that the aeroplane has sufficient rudder and aileron authority to 
maintain directional and lateral control. A pilot must adhere to the VREF speeds because they 
are the speeds which have been used to construct the landing graphs or table in the aeroplane 
flight manual.  If a pilot were to deviate from these speeds, the required aircraft performance 
would not be achieved.
Presentation of Landing Data / Using the Graphs
This part of the chapter will deal with how the aeroplane’s landing distance can actually be 
calculated.  All aeroplanes will have either a pilot operating handbook or an aeroplane flight 
manual.  The purpose of these manuals is not only to show how to operate the aeroplane but 
also to detail the aeroplane’s performance. 
The example graph we will use is Figure 3.9 on page 21 of section 3 in CAP 698.  Always take 
a look at the associated conditions first, paying particular attention to the power and flap 
settings as shown at the top of the graph. Also notice that this graph assumes a runway which 
is paved, level and dry.  If the runway conditions required for a given calculation are different 
to those specified, corrections will need to be made to the values that this graph will give.  We 
saw these correction factors earlier.  
The left hand carpet of the graph involves the variations in temperature and pressure altitude. 
This part of the graph accounts for the effect of air density on the landing distance.  The middle 
carpet accounts for the effect of the mass and to the right of this carpet is the wind correction 
carpet.  Notice the differences in the slope of the headwind and tailwind lines.  This means 
the 150% and 50% wind rules have been applied.  The last carpet on the far right of the graph 
is used because you will recall that the landing starts at a height of 50 ft above the landing 
surface.  If you travel straight through the last carpet, you will only calculate the landing roll, 
which in the example on the graph is 1120 ft.
Follow through the example that has been carried out for you in the graph.  This will help you 
to use the graph correctly.   Not only is there an example on the graph itself, but if you look 
at the bottom of page 20 of section 3 in CAP 698 you will see another example which you can 
work through.   Use the examples; they are there to help you.  If you need practice on working 
through the graphs, use the questions at the end of the chapter.

Class A Aircraft - Take-off
Introduction
The specimen aeroplane used for Class A performance is the Boeing 737-400 series.  Just to 
remind you, Class A aeroplanes are defined as being any multi-engine jet, or any turbo-propeller 
aeroplane with a mass of more than  5700 kilograms OR 10 seats or more.
Because of the high passenger capacity and high speed of these aeroplanes, they must have 
the highest safety standards.  Safety standards are enforced in two ways.  Firstly by the 
certification requirements, which are laid down in CS-25, and secondly by the operational 
requirements which are laid down in EU-OPS 1. The operational requirements have one unique 
detail regarding Class A aeroplanes that is very different when compared to Class B aeroplanes. 
This difference is that the requirements state that for Class A aeroplanes engine failure must be 
considered for all stages of flight, whereas for multi-engine Class B aeroplanes, engine failure 
was not assumed below 300 ft.  Assuming engine failure for Class A aeroplanes adds an extra 
dimension to understanding and assessment of the aeroplane’s performance.  Because of this, 
a lot of new terms and concepts will be introduced which you will need to become very familiar 
with before a full appreciation can be made of Class A aeroplane performance.
Operational Requirements
However, before we detail these new terms and concepts, let us examine what the operational 
requirements are.  EU-OPS 1.490 states that an operator must ensure the take-off mass does 
not exceed the maximum take-off mass as published in the aeroplane flight manual.  When 
calculating the maximum take-off mass, the accelerate-stop distance must not exceed the 
accelerate-stop distance available,  the take-off distance  must not exceed the take-off distance 
available, and lastly the take-off run must not exceed the take-off run available.  To comply 
with the regulations we must use a single V1 speed, which will be examined later, and account 
must be taken of the aerodrome conditions. To determine the maximum permissible mass for 
take-off it is necessary to consider the limits set by:
•	 the aerodrome distances available (Field Limit Mass)
•	 the climb requirements (Climb Limit Mass)
•	 obstacle clearance (Obstacle Limit Mass)
•	 brake energy limitations (VMBE)
•	 tyre speed limitations (Tyre Speed Limit Mass)
•	 runway strength limitation (ACN/PCN)
•	 maximum structural mass
Field Length Requirements
Next it is important to find out how the take-off run, take-off distance and accelerate-stop 
distance are calculated and what safety margins the authorities have included.  In other words, 
how the net distances are worked out.  These distances are defined in CS-25 and cover the 
cases of take-off with all engines operating and take-off with engine failure, for both dry and 
wet runways.  You can see abbreviated versions of these requirements in CAP 698 on page 7 of 
section 4 under paragraph 2.1.2.  Do not try and commit these requirements to memory; CAP 
698 explains the requirements quite suitably and they are listed over the page and in CAP 698.

Net  Take-off Run Required
If the take-off distance includes a clearway, the take-off run is the greatest of:
•	 All power units operating (dry and wet runway). The total of the gross distance from the 
start of the take-off run to the point at which VLOF is reached, plus one half of the gross 
distance from VLOF to the point at which the aeroplane reaches 35 ft, all factored by 1.15 to 
obtain the net TORR.  
As an example, let us assume the distance from brake release to halfway between VLOF and 
35 ft is 1747 metres.  This is then multiplied by 1.15.  Multiplying 1747 metres by 1.15 makes 
the total distance 2009 metres.
•	 One power unit inoperative (dry runway). The horizontal distance from the brake release 
point (BRP) to a point equidistant between VLOF and the point at which the aeroplane 
reaches 35 ft with the critical power unit inoperative.
  
As an example, let us assume that this distance is 1950 metres.
•	 One power unit inoperative (wet runway). The horizontal distance from the brake release 
point (BRP) to the point at which the aeroplane is 15 ft above the take-off surface, achieved 
in a manner consistent with the attainment of V2 by 35 ft, assuming the critical power unit 
inoperative at VEF. 
Lastly, as an example, let us assume that this distance is 2001 metres
Once these three distances have been calculated by the manufacturer, the greatest of the three 
is then published as the certified net take-off run required.  In our example, the net take-off 
run required is 2009 metres.  In the exam you will be presented with various distances and you 
must be able to work out which of the distances is selected as the net take-off run required.
Net Accelerate-stop Distance Required
The accelerate-stop distance on a wet runway is the greatest of:
•	 All engines operating. The sum of the distances required to accelerate from BRP to the 
highest speed reached during the rejected take-off, assuming the pilot takes the first action 
to reject the take-off at the V1 for take-off from a wet runway and to decelerate to a full stop 
on a wet hard surface, plus a distance equivalent to 2 seconds at the V1 for take-off from a 
wet runway.
•	 One engine inoperative. The sum of the distances required to accelerate from BRP to the 
highest speed reached during the rejected take-off, assuming the critical engine fails at VEF 
and the pilot takes the first action to reject the take-off at the V1 for take-off from a wet 
runway with all engines operating and to decelerate to a full stop on a wet hard surface 
with one engine inoperative, plus a distance equivalent to 2 seconds at the V1 for take-off 
from a wet runway.
•	 The accelerate-stop distance on a dry runway.

Class A Aircraft - Take-off
Net  Take-off Distance Required
The take-off distance required is the greatest of the following three distances:
•	 All engines operating. The horizontal distance travelled, with all engines operating, to 
reach a screen height of 35 ft multiplied by 1.15
•	 One engine inoperative (dry runway). The horizontal distance from BRP to the point at 
which the aeroplane attains 35 ft, assuming the critical power unit fails at VEF on a dry, hard 
surface.
•	 One engine inoperative (wet runway). The horizontal distance from BRP to the point at 
which the aeroplane attains 15 ft, assuming the critical power unit fails at VEF on a wet or 
contaminated hard surface, achieved in a manner consistent with the achievement of V2 by 
35 ft.
Note:    The reduction of the screen height from 35 ft to 15 ft is to help reduce the take-off mass 
penalties that a wet runway will undoubtedly cause.
The V Speeds
VMCG  -  Ground Minimum Control Speed
VMCG is short for the ground minimum control speed, and it is described for you in CAP 698 at 
the bottom of page 3 section 4.  It states VMCG is the minimum speed on the ground at which 
the take-off can be safely continued, when the critical engine suddenly becomes inoperative 
with the remaining engine(s) at take-off thrust.  Let us try and understand what this actually 
means.
When an engine fails, the remaining engine(s) still generates thrust and this causes the 
aeroplane to yaw away from the live engine.  The amount of yaw is a function of the amount 
of thrust the live engine is generating.  Greater thrust from the live engine would generate 
more yaw.  The only way to counteract this is to use the ailerons and the rudder to try and 
steer the aeroplane in the right direction.  However, when the aeroplane is on the ground, 
you cannot use the ailerons to control the yaw otherwise you might bank the wing into the 
ground.  Therefore the only available aerodynamic surface left to control the asymmetric yaw is 
the rudder.  However, for the rudder to be effective enough at controlling the yaw, there must 
be sufficient airflow over it to ensure it has the required aerodynamic force.  This minimum 
airflow speed over the rudder is VMCG.  If the engine were to fail below this speed, then there 
is insufficient flow over the rudder to counteract the asymmetric yaw and therefore it is not 
possible to continue the take-off.
The only factor that controls the value of VMCG is thrust, and since take-off thrust is more or 
less constant, then the only variable on the amount of take-off thrust generated is air density. 
The higher the air density, the more thrust that can be generated and therefore the more yaw 
that is generated when the engine fails, therefore the airflow over the rudder must be faster 
to make the rudder effective enough to counteract the yaw.
The effect of air density on VMCG can be seen by looking at the second table from the bottom on 
pages 18 and 19 of section 4 in CAP 698. This table shows the variable of temperature on one 
side and the variable of pressure altitude on the other.  Look at the VMCG in the table and notice 
that at low temperatures and low pressure altitudes where the air density would be high, the 
value of VMCG is also high.  Therefore we can say that as density increases, VMCG increases.

VEF 
The calibrated airspeed at which the critical engine is assumed to fail.  It is used for the purpose 
of performance calculations.  It is never less than VMCG.  
The speed VEF  is a rather strange one. As per the certification specification definition, VEF 
means the speed at which the critical engine is assumed to fail during take-off.  VEF  is selected 
by the aeroplane manufacture for purposes of certification testing, primarily to establish the 
range of speeds from which V1 may be selected and secondly to help determine the accelerate-
stop distance required.  Lets us try and explain what VEF  is all about.
The definition of V1 is the speed at which, if the failure of the critical engine was recognized, 
there is sufficient distance remaining to either reject the take-off or continue the take-off. 
However, recognizing that the engine has failed does take time, in fact it takes about 1 second. 
Therefore to recognize the engine failure at V1, the engine must have failed about 1 second 
before V1.  The speed, at which the critical engine fails, so that it may be recognized at V1, is 
called VEF .
V1 - Decision Speed
This is by far the most important speed in the take-off for Class A aeroplanes.  V1 is called the 
decision speed. It is so called because V1 determines the outcome of a critical decision that must 
be made following an engine failure or other major critical systems failure. 
V1 is defined as being the maximum speed at which the pilot must take the first action in 
order to stop the aeroplane within the remaining accelerate-stop distance.  V1 is also the 
minimum speed following engine failure that the pilot is able to continue the take-off within 
the remaining take-off distance.
VGO is the lowest decision speed from which a continued take-off is possible within the take-off 
distance available. VSTOP is the highest decision speed from which the aeroplane can stop within 
the accelerate-stop distance available.  These two speeds are the extremes of V1.
There are some rules about the speed for V1.  These are shown in CAP 698 on page 2 of section 
4 alongside the V1 definition.  It states that V1:
•	 may not be less than VEF plus the speed gained with the critical engine inoperative for the 
time between engine failure and the point at which the pilot applies the first means of 
retardation
•	 must not exceed VR
•	 must not exceed VMBE
•	 must not be less than VMCG
If the engine were to fail before V1, then the decision would be to abort the take-off.  The 
reason is because, with only one engine operating, there would be insufficient take-off distance 
left to accelerate the aeroplane to the screen height.  If the engine were to fail after V1, the 
decision is to continue the take-off.  The reason is because the aeroplane is travelling too fast to 
be able to stop within the remaining accelerate-stop distance available. In order to understand 
how V1 is derived, we need to consider a graph which is shown in Figure 14.1.  This graph plots 
the take-off distance required and accelerate-stop distance required based on a varying engine 
failure speed.

Figure 14.1 A graph showing the ideal position of V1.
Looking at the graph you can see that a V1 at the intersection point of the graph is the best 
V1 to use, simply because a V1 at that speed requires the least amount of field required or the 
least amount of runway.  The V1 at the intersection point of the curves is sometimes called 
the “Idealized V1”.  It is also the V1 which makes the take-off distance required be the same 
length as the accelerate-stop distance required, and therefore, this V1 speed is also called the 
“Balanced V1” since it balances the required distances for the aeroplane. What this graph is also 
useful for is to see the effect of using a higher or lower V1.  
For example, if for whatever reason V1 was increased, notice that the accelerate-stop distance 
required increases, the take-off distance required decreases and the total field required 
increases.  However, should V1 be reduced from the intersection point, the accelerate-stop 
distance decreases, the take-off distance increases and the total field required increases.  Trying 
to figure these points out without the use of this simple graph would not be easy.  So use this 
graph to help you understand the effect of increasing or decreasing V1.
Factors Affecting V1
It is important to detail what factors can influence V1.  In essence, whatever factors change 
either the accelerate-stop distance required or the take-off distance required curves shown 
in Figure 14.1, will affect V1.  However, there is a simpler way to go through the list of factors 
affecting V1.  In every aeroplane flight manual there will be a set of tables and/or graphs which 
will allow you to calculate what V1 should be on any given day.  On page 18 and 19 of section 4 
in CAP 698 are such tables.  Turn to page 18 and look at the second table from the top of the 
page where you see a column “A” and “B” etc.  This table lists the three V speeds, including 
V1 against the aeroplane mass.  This table can show us what the effect of certain factors are. 
•	 MASS For example, let us look at what aeroplane mass does to V1.  Look under column A 
and under V1.  If the aeroplane mass was 50 000 kg, V1 would be 129 knots, but if the mass 
was increased to 65 000 kg then V1 would increase to 151 knots.  Therefore, increasing mass 
increases V1.

•	 CONFIGURATION The next factor to affect V1 is the aeroplane configuration.  Page 18 lists 
the V speeds for 5 degrees of flap and page 19 lists the V speeds with 15 degrees of flap. 
Therefore, comparing the speeds from these two pages should tell us the effect of the flaps. 
On page 18, which is 5 degrees of flap and using column A again, a 55 000 kg mass requires 
a V1 speed of 137 knots, but on page 19, which is 15 degrees of flap and for the same mass 
of 55 000 kg, the V1 speed is now 130 knots.  Therefore we can see that increasing the flap 
angle decreases V1.
•	 DENSITY The next factor to affect V1 is density, but this is a little harder to observe than 
the previous two factors.  On page 17 of section 4 is a small table, which has temperature 
on one axis and pressure altitude on the other.  This is the density accountability table. 
Under low altitudes and low temperatures is band A.  This is a high density band, whereas 
band F is situated at higher temperatures and higher altitudes which equates to much lower 
densities.  We can now use these bands to see the effect density has on V1.  Returning to 
page 18, notice that bands A, B, C, D, E and F are in the speed tables.  Taking a mass of 
50 000 kg in band A, which is high density, V1 is 129 knots, but in bands B, C, D and E, the 
value of V1 is increasing.  Therefore, as density falls, shown by going through bands A to E, 
V1 increases.
•	 SLOPE AND WIND The last two factors that affect V1 are runway slope and wind.  Notice that 
at the top of pages 18 and 19 there is a table which is titled “Slope and Wind V1 adjustment”. 
If there were a downslope of 2%, then with an aeroplane mass of 70 000 kg, V1 would have 
to be reduced by 3 knots,  whereas if the runway had an upslope of 2%, with the same mass, 
V1 must be increased by 4 knots.  Therefore, downslopes reduce V1 and upslopes increase 
V1.  The right hand side of the table is the correction for wind.  So, for example, if there was 
a 15 knot tailwind, then with a mass of 70 000 kg, V1 would have to be reduced by 3 knots, 
whereas if there was a headwind of 40 knots for the same mass, V1 would have to increase 
by 1 knot.  Therefore, tailwinds reduce V1, and headwinds increase V1.
Having finished discussing the main factors affecting V1, there are other influences, however, 
which may or may not change the value of V1.  Two influences on V1 in particular are the 
speeds VMCG and VMBE.  In CAP 698 on page 2 of section 4 we see the definition of V1, but more 
importantly, at the end of the paragraph we read that V1 must not be less than VMCG, and not 
greater than VR and not greater than VMBE.  Since V1 must be between VMCG, VR and VMBE, then 
depending on the values of these speeds, they may or may not push V1 to be higher or lower 
than the ideal V1 speed.  
VMBE - Maximum Brake Energy Speed 
We stated that there were two particular speeds that can influence V1.  One of them was VMCG, 
which we discussed earlier, the other was VMBE.  Turning back to the top of page 3 of section 4 
of CAP 698 you can see the description of VMBE.  VMBE is the maximum brake energy speed and it 
represents the maximum speed on the ground from which an aeroplane can safely stop within 
the energy capabilities of the brakes.  Essentially this means that if the take-off was rejected 
at a speed higher than VMBE, and maximum braking force was applied, the brakes would not 
be able to safely bring the aeroplane to a stop regardless of how much runway was left.  The 
brakes would most probably catch fire, melt and/or disintegrate. 
You do need to be aware of the factors that control VMBE, but luckily, most manuals, and indeed 
CAP 698 has a VMBE graph or table with all the variables and factors on it that can affect VMBE. 
The graph concerned is on page 15 of section 4.  If you need to see the effect of a variable, for 
example, mass, simply work through the graph but use two different masses.  In this case the 
heavier mass has reduced VMBE.  The variables that affect VMBE are pressure altitude, ambient air

Class A Aircraft - Take-off
temperature, mass, slope and wind.  Carefully examine each of these factors so you can see for 
yourself how they change VMBE.  Remember, CAP 698 is for use in the exam, so if there are any 
questions which relate to VMBE, you can rest assured that a lot of information on VMBE is already 
in front of you.
The relationship between VMCG ,V1  and  VMBE
Having looked at VMBE and VMCG we are now better placed to understand why these two speeds 
play a role in influencing V1.  According to the rule, V1 must not be less than VMCG, as shown in 
Figure 14.2.
Figure 14.2 The relationship of V1 with VMCG and VMBE.
V1 cannot be allowed to be less than VMCG because engine failure below VMCG means the 
aeroplane is uncontrollable and the definition of V1 is that the take-off can be continued 
following engine failure.
The rule also stated that V1 must not be greater than VMBE.  Again, this makes sense, because at 
V1 the aeroplane must be able to stop or continue the take-off, but above VMBE it is impossible 
to bring the aeroplane safely to a stop.
Let us look at a scenario, where due to high density the value of VMCG is higher than the idealized 
V1.  In this case, take-off is prohibited.   However, this problem is solvable.  The chosen V1 can 
simply be increased until it is equal to or more than VMCG.  However, notice that the accelerate-
stop distance increases, the take-off distance decreases and more importantly, the total field 
length required increases.  So long as the runway is as long as the total field required, then 
moving V1 to this point is not a problem.   Hopefully, by understanding this graph you are able 
to see the consequences to the required distance should V1 need to be moved from its ideal or 
balanced position due to pressure from VMCG and VMBE.

VMU - Minimum Unstick Speed 
The speed VMU is defined as the minimum unstick speed.  VMU is the slowest calibrated airspeed 
at which the aeroplane can safely lift off the ground, and continue the take-off.  However, 
despite VMU being the lowest speed the aeroplane can safely lift off the runway, in actual 
operating conditions, the aeroplane does not lift off at this speed.  The aeroplane is flown so 
that it actually lifts off at a slightly faster speed.  The reason is because VMU is very close to the 
stall speed, the aeroplane controllability is very “sloppy”, and lastly, in order to actually lift off 
at VMU some fairly dramatic actions take place which may be uncomfortable for the passengers.
It may seem strange, but the aeroplane is actually able to lift off at a speed where lift is less 
than weight.  
The reason being because, so long as the nose can be raised to a high enough attitude, there 
is a vertical component of thrust which, together with lift, balances weight.  The amount of 
this vertical thrust is controlled in part by the amount of thrust generated, but also by the 
amount of nose-up attitude the aeroplane can attain.  This nose-up attitude may be limited by 
the power of the elevator to push the tailplane down, or by the tailplane striking the runway 
in what is described as a tail strike.  
Hopefully now you are able to realize why it is unwise in operational conditions to lift the 
aeroplane off the ground at VMU. The actual speed the aeroplane will lift off, in operational 
flights, is called VLOF and we will discuss this speed later.
VMCA / VMC   -  Air Minimum Control Speed
The air minimum control speed.  The minimum flight speed at which the aeroplane is controllable, 
with a maximum of 5° bank, when the critical engine suddenly becomes inoperative with the 
remaining engine(s) at take-off thrust. Although VMCA is the minimum control speed in the air, 
the factors that affect VMCA can for the purpose of the exam, be assumed to be the same as  for 
VMCG.
VR  -  Rotation Speed
Rotation speed, VR, is the speed at which the pilot initiates action to raise the nose gear off the 
ground, with the intention of becoming airborne.  The pilot action is to pull back on the control 
column.  This action deflects the elevators to create a downward aerodynamic force.  This force 
rotates the aeroplane about its lateral axis and will raise the nose wheel off the ground.
VR may not be less than:
•	 V1
•	 1.05VMC
•	 a speed such that V2 may be attained before 35 ft.
•	 a speed such that if the aeroplane is rotated at its maximum practicable rate the result will 
be a VLOF of not less than 1.1VMU  (all engines operating) or 1.05VMU (engine inoperative) [ if 
the aeroplane is geometry limited or elevator power limited these margins are 1.08VMU (all 
engines) and 1.04VMU (engine inoperative)]

Class A Aircraft - Take-off
Figure 14.3 
Lastly, as with other speeds, we need to examine the factors that affect VR.  However, this is 
made easy for you.  As with V1, all the factors that can affect VR can be found by examining 
pages 18 and 19 of section 4 in CAP 698.  On pages 18 and 19 examine the second table from 
the top.  This table lists the three V speeds, including VR, against the aeroplane mass.  This table 
can show us what the effect of certain factors is.  For example, let us look at what aeroplane 
mass does to VR.  
If the aeroplane mass was 50 000 kg,  VR would be 131 knots under density column A, but if the 
mass was increased to 65 000 kg then VR would increase to 155 knots.  Therefore, increasing 
mass increases VR.  
The next factor to affect VR is the aeroplane configuration.  Page 18 lists the V speeds for 5 
degrees flaps and page 19 lists the V speeds with 15 degrees of flap.  Therefore, comparing 
the speeds from these two pages should tell us the effect of the flaps.  On page 18, which is 5 
degrees of flap, a 55 000 kg mass requires a VR speed of 139 knots, but on page 19, which is 15 
degrees of flap and for the same mass of 55 000 kg, the VR speed is now 131 knots.  Therefore 
we can see that increasing the flap angle decreases VR.  
The next factor to affect VR is density.  On page 17 of section 4 is the density graph. You may 
recall that band A is a high density band, whereas band F equates to lower density.  We can 
now use these bands to see the effect density has on VR.  Returning to page 18, taking a mass 
of 50 000 kg in band A, which is high density, VR is 131 knots, but in bands B, C, D and E, the 
value of VR is increasing.  Therefore we can state that as density decreases, VR increases. 
In modern airliners, VR is calculated not by looking at speed tables, but it will be computed 
by the aeroplane once the relevant data is inserted in the flight management computer or 
multipurpose computer display unit.  Once V1 and VR have been calculated by the pilots, they 
can be entered into the Flight Management System and thereafter shown to the pilots in the 
speed scale on the left hand side of the Primary Flight Display (PFD) or Electronic Attitude 
Director Indicator (EADI).

Effects of early and over-rotation
If the aircraft is rotated to the correct attitude but at too low a speed, lift-off will not occur 
until the normal VLOF, but there will be higher drag during the increased time in the rotated 
attitude, giving increased distance to lift-off.  Rotation to an attitude greater than the normal 
lift-off attitude could bring the wing close to its ground stalling angle.  Ground stall should not 
be possible with leading edge devices correctly set, so it is of extreme importance that these 
devices are set to the take-off position.
CS-25.107 requires:
•	 the take-off distance using a rotation speed of 5 knots less than VR shall not exceed the take-
off distance using the established VR
•	 reasonable variations in procedures such as over-rotation and out of trim conditions must 
not result in marked increases in take-off distance.
Note:  The expression ‘marked increase’ in the take-off distance is defined as any amount in 
excess of 1% of the scheduled distance.
VLOF - Lift-off Speed 
VLOF means the lift-off speed. VLOF is the calibrated airspeed at which the aeroplane first becomes 
airborne which is at the moment when the main wheels have left the runway.  VLOF should be 
faster than the minimum unstick speed VMU.  The margin above VMU is determined by several 
factors.  
For example, VLOF must not be less than 110% of VMU in the all engines operating condition 
and 105% of VMU in the one engine inoperative condition.  However, if the attitude of the 
aeroplane in obtaining VMU was limited by the geometry of the aeroplane (i.e. tail contact with 
the runway), VLOF must not be less than 108% of VMU in the all engines operating condition and 
104% of VMU in the one engine inoperative condition. 
Tyre Speed Limit
Aeroplane tyres are designed to carry very high loads and operate at very high speeds. It is 
common for a jet aeroplane tyre to carry loads as heavy as 27 000 kilograms while operating 
at ground speeds up to 235 miles per hour or ground speeds of 204 knots. Tyres are carefully 
designed and tested to withstand operation up to, but not necessarily beyond, these ratings.
V2MIN
The minimum take-off safety speed, with the critical engine inoperative.
V2MIN may not be less than:
•	 1.13VSR for 2 and 3 engine turboprops and all turbojets without provision for obtaining 
a significant reduction in the one engine inoperative power-on stalling speed OR 1.08VSR 
for turboprops with more than 3 engines and turbojets with provision for obtaining a 
significant reduction in the one engine inoperative power-on stalling speed.
•	 1.1VMC

V2  -  Take-off Safety Speed
The speed V2 is called the take-off safety speed.  On page 3 of section 4 of CAP 698 it states 
that V2 is the target speed to be attained with one engine inoperative.  In other words, V2 must 
be reached at or prior to the screen height.  Why is V2 called the take-off safety speed, what is 
safe about reaching it? 
There are two main speeds which when flying close to, may be unsafe.  The first of these is stall 
speed and the second is the minimum control speed.  Therefore, in order for V2 to be called a 
safe speed it must be faster than these speeds.  There is another reason why V2 is called the 
take-off safety speed.  In the event of engine failure, V2 must be flown until the aeroplane 
reaches 400 ft.  Therefore, the other safe feature about V2 is that the aeroplane is able to 
achieve a positive climb.  In fact, V2 is the slowest speed which will enable the aeroplane to have 
sufficient excess thrust to climb above the minimum acceptable climb gradients.
V2 may not be less than:
•	 V2MIN
•	 VR plus the speed increment attained up to 35 ft.

To analyse all the factors that can affect V2 turn to pages 18 and 19 of section 4 in CAP 698. 
You will recall from similar discussions on V1 and VR that these pages can show the effect of 
mass, configuration and density on V2.  So ensure you can use these pages to see for yourself 
how these factors change V2.
Once V2 is calculated by the pilots it can be entered into the flight management computer just 
like V1 and VR were.  Having done this, V2 will be displayed to the pilots in the speed scale on the 
left hand side of the Primary Flight Display or Electronic Attitude Director Indicator.

Presentation of Data
A complete analysis of take-off performance requires account to be taken of any stopway 
and clearway available.  As this is time consuming and will often give a maximum permissible 
take-off mass in excess of that required, simplified data is often presented to permit a rapid 
assessment of the take-off mass. One method of doing this is to use balanced field data.
Balanced Field
A balanced field exists if the take-off distance is equal to the accelerate-stop distance.  An 
aerodrome which has no stopway or clearway has a balanced field.  For an aeroplane taking 
off,  if  an  engine failure occurs, the later the engine fails, the greater will be the accelerate-
stop distance required but the less will be the take-off distance required  At some speed the 
two distances will be equal.  Figure 14.6 shows the variation of these distances graphically.
Figure 14.6 
The distance, point A in Figure 14.6, is the balanced field length required for the prevailing 
conditions.  It represents the maximum distance required for those conditions, because at 
whatever speed the engine fails, the distance is adequate, either to stop if the failure occurs 
before V1 or to complete the take-off if the failure occurs after V1.

Unbalanced Field
For a given weight and conditions, the balanced field V1 will give the optimum performance, 
since the TODR and the ASDR are equal.   In some circumstances, however, this V1 will not be 
acceptable, as V1 must lie within the limits of VMCG , VR and VMBE .  The following situations will 
give an unbalanced field:
•	 V1 less than VMCG
At low weights and altitudes V1 for the balanced field may be less than VMCG.  In this case V1 
would have to be increased to VMCG and so the TODR would be less, and the ASDR would 
be greater than the balanced field length.  The field length required would be equal to the 
ASDR at VMCG.

Class A Aircraft - Take-off
•	 V1 greater than VMBE
At high weight, altitude and temperature, the balanced field V1 may exceed the VMBE.  V1 
would have to be reduced to VMBE giving a TODR greater, and an ASDR which is less, than 
the balanced field length.  The field length required would be equal to the TODR at VMBE.

Class A Aircraft - Take-off
•	 V1 greater than VR
For aircraft with good braking capabilities, the stopping distance will be short, giving a high 
balanced field V1 speed.   If this exceeds VR for the weight, V1 will have to be reduced to VR 
and the field length required will be equal to the TODR at VR.

Class A Aircraft - Take-off
V1 Range
If the balanced field available is greater than the balanced field required for the required take-
off mass and conditions, there will be a range of speed within which V1 can be chosen.  This 
situation is illustrated in Figure 14.10.
Figure 14.10 
VGO is the first speed at which the take-off can be completed within the distance available, and 
VSTOP is the last speed at which the accelerate-stop could be completed within the distance.  The 
V1 speed can therefore be chosen anywhere between VGO and VSTOP.
Take-off from an Unbalanced Field
If the take-off aerodrome is not a balanced field, the balanced field data can be used by assuming 
a balanced field equal to the lesser of the Take-off Distance Available and the Accelerate-stop 
Distance Available.  This distance may exceed the Take-off Run Available unless the TORA 
becomes limiting.  The take-off mass obtained will of course be less than that which could have 
been obtained by taking account of stopway and clearway, but if the mass is sufficient for the 
flight, it will not be necessary to go into a more detailed analysis.

Field Limit Brake Release Mass / Field Limit Mass
This section of the chapter will focus on calculating the various limiting masses for take-off. 
Class A aeroplanes have data presented to the pilot in a different way than smaller Class B 
aeroplanes.  Whereas Class B aeroplane data for take-off would show what length of runway 
would be used for any given mass,  Class A aeroplane data shows what maximum mass could 
be taken for a given runway length.  This makes sense since Class A aeroplanes are used 
commercially and the interest of the airlines is to carry the maximum payload possible for the 
flight.  Therefore, most performance graphs or tables will give a mass as their outcome.  The 
first of these performance masses is the field limit brake release mass.  
The field limit brake release mass is the maximum mass that will allow the aeroplane to meet its 
field length requirements at the airfield concerned.  Therefore, to be heavier than the field limit 
mass would mean that either the one engine inoperative or the all engine operative take-off 
run, take-off distance or accelerate-stop distance exceeds the available distance at the airfield. 
If you remember, airfields can have different lengths of take-off run, take-off distance and 
accelerate-stop distance available.  Therefore, there should be many mass graphs.  There 
should be mass graphs for ensuring that the mass is such that the take-off run required is within 
the take-off run available, that the take-off distance required is within the take-off distance 
available  and lastly another mass graph to ensure the accelerate-stop distance required is 
within the accelerate-stop distance available.  However, there is only one graph and only one 
assumed available distance to calculate the field limit mass.  The reason is for simplicity.  The 
graph assumes that the take-off run available, the take-off distance available and the accelerate-
stop distance available are the same length even though the take-off distance available and 
accelerate-stop distance available may be longer.  Therefore no stopways or clearways are 
accounted for.  When the take-off distance available and the accelerate-stop distance available 
are the same, the field is described as being balanced.  In this case the balanced field length 
also happens to be the same length as the take-off run available because there are no stopways 
or clearways.  To use the graph, make sure you only enter the take-off run available as the 
length of field available.
An example of a typical balanced field length graph is shown in Figure 14.11.  This graph is 
exactly like the one shown in CAP 698 on page 9 of section 4.  Notice at the bottom of the 
graph there is only one field distance to enter the graph with but, of course, an airfield has 
many distances, such as the TODA and the ASDA.  Because there is only one distance to enter 
into the graph it must be balanced field length.  The introduction to the graph is at the top of 
page 7 of section 4 in CAP 698 and it reiterates that the graph assumes a balanced field.  For 
unbalanced fields use the information under paragraph 2.5.1 on page 16 of section 4.  This 
latter information is for adjusting V1 when the field is unbalanced.

Climb Gradient Limit Mass
The field limit mass is not the only mass that must be considered in the take-off, there are several 
more.  The next mass to consider is the climb limit brake release mass.   The graph for calculating 
this mass is Figure 4.5 which is on page 11 of section 4 in CAP 698.  The climb limit mass is 
sometimes referred to as the Weight Altitude Temperature or Mass Altitude Temperature limit, 
abbreviated to the WAT or MAT limit.  Before we work though the climb limit mass graph let us 
try and understand what this mass means.  The climb limit mass is the maximum mass that will 
enable the aeroplane to achieve a certain minimum climb performance.  This minimum climb 
performance is the most severe of the climb gradient requirements.  The most severe climb 
gradient requirement is in fact 2.4% which will be covered later.   In other words, if the mass 
of the aeroplane was greater than the climb limit mass then the aeroplane may still be able to 
climb, but it will not achieve the minimum air gradients that the authorities have laid down.  In 
other words the aeroplane would not achieve the climb requirements.  The gradients for the 
climb requirements will be discussed in the next chapter but remember that these gradients are 
air gradients and are therefore unaffected by wind.  Figure 14.12 shows a typical presentation 
of the climb limited take-off mass and is found in CAP 698 on page 11 of section 4.

Tyre Speed Limit Mass
The reason for a tyre speed limit is because naturally there is resistance between the wheel and 
the runway.  As the wheel rotates this resistance generates heat.  The greater the wheel speed 
and/or the greater the load on the wheel, the greater the heat generated.  Too much heat 
will not only disintegrate the tyre but it may also expand the air within the tyre and may over 
pressurize it.  This is dangerous and may result in a tyre blow out, although there are fusible 
plugs in modern tyres to help prevent this.  As you can now understand, there is a maximum 
ground speed and maximum mass that the wheels can be subject to.  The maximum ground 
speed that the tyre will experience will be at VLOF, and as a result, tyre speed limits are designed 
to be greater than or equal to the fastest VLOF.  
For most medium range jets the maximum tyre speed limit is set at 195 knots which is about 
225 miles per hour. Figure 14.13 shows a typical presentation of the tyre speed limited take-off 
mass graph found in CAP 698 on page 13 of section 4.

Brake Energy Limit
For an aircraft of mass M, travelling at a true speed of V, the kinetic energy is ½ MV2.  If the 
aircraft is braked to a stop from this speed, a large proportion of this energy will go into the 
brakes as heat.  The energy capacity of the brakes is limited and so for a given mass there will 
be a limiting speed from which a stop can be made.  This will be a True Ground Speed, and so 
the corresponding IAS will vary with altitude, temperature and wind.  Runway slope will also 
affect the speed, as a change in height involves a change in potential energy.
The brake energy limit speed VMBE must not be less than the V1 speed.  If it is, the mass must 
be reduced until V1 and VMBE are the same.  The flight manual will give the amount of weight 
to be deducted for each knot that V1 exceeds VMBE.   For most aircraft, VMBE will only be limiting 
in extremely adverse conditions of altitude, temperature, wind and runway slope.  In fact if 
you look at Figure 14.14 you will notice a grey area in the graph on the top left hand side.  If 
the mass and pressure altitude falls within this grey area then VMBE will not be limiting, unless 
operating with a tailwind or improved climb performance. The same graph can be seen in CAP 
698 on page 15 of section 4.

Brake Cooling
The value of VMBE obtained from the data assumes that the brakes are at ambient temperature 
before the start of take-off.  If a take-off is rejected following a recent landing, or after 
prolonged taxiing, the brakes will already be at a fairly high temperature, and their ability 
to absorb further energy will be reduced. Data is given in the manual to show the time to be 
allowed for the brakes to cool.  An example of a brake cooling graph is shown in Figure 14.15 
and it can also be found in CAP 698 on page 50 of section 4.

Runway Strength
The operating mass of the aircraft may be limited by runway strength considerations.  The 
bearing strength of a pavement is expressed by a PCN (Pavement Classification Number) and 
this is compared to the ACN (Aircraft Classification Number).  The UK system of classification 
is the LCN (Load Classification Number) but this can be converted into the PCN system.  The 
PCN is compared to the ACN.  Operation on the pavement is permissible if the ACN is less than 
or equal to the PCN.  Because the PCN includes a safety factor, a 10% increase of ACN over 
PCN is generally acceptable for pavements that are in good condition and occasional use by 
aircraft with ACNs up to 50% greater than the PCN may be permitted.  In such circumstances 
the movement of the aircraft must be very closely monitored for damage to the aeroplane and 
pavement.
Maximum Take-off Mass
Consideration of the mass determined by the field length available, the climb requirement, the 
tyre speed limit, and the brake energy limit will determine the maximum performance mass 
for take-off.  It will be the lowest of the masses given by the above limitations. This mass is 
called the performance limited mass.  The performance limited mass must then be compared 
to maximum structural mass and the lower of the two masses is then selected as the take-off 
mass.  This mass is known as the regulated take-off mass.  
If there are obstacles to be considered on the take-off flight path, this may determine a further 
limitation on take-off mass.  Analysis of obstacle clearance limited mass is examined in Chapter 
15.
Calculating Take-off Speeds and Thrust Settings
When the maximum permissible take-off mass (regulated take-off mass) has been determined, 
it is necessary to find the corresponding take-off speeds and thrust settings.  CAP 698 on pages 
17, 18, 19 and 20 of section 4 show the presentation of the take-off speeds V1, VR and V2 and 
the % N1 for take-off. 
Take-off Speeds
Having chosen the regulated take-off mass, which for the purpose of an example we shall 
assume is 57 900 kg, we are now able to select the take-off V speeds of V1, VR and V2.  Before 
we calculate these speeds the speed band needs to be selected.  At the bottom of page 17 of 
section 4 of CAP 698 is a small table and this is reproduced in Figure 14.16.  This graph is the 
density correction graph for the take-off V speeds.  As an example, let us assume a temperature 
of 25 degrees Celsius at an aerodrome pressure altitude of 2000 ft.  In our example, the speed 
band to use is speed band B.

Figure 14.16 The density band selection for the take-off V speeds.
Turning over the page in CAP 698 from page 17 of section 4 to pages 18 and 19 you can see 
the speed tables.  There are two sets of speed tables.  The one on page 18 is for a 5 degrees 
of  flap setting and page 19 is for a 15 degrees of flap setting.  For our example we will assume 
5 degrees of flap with a regulated take-off mass of 57 900 kg.  Using the speed tables for 5 
degrees of flap (page 18 section 4) identify the column for speed band B (should be roughly in 
the middle of the page).  This is reproduced for you in Figure 14.17 and the areas to concentrate 
on are highlighted in red for you.
Figure 14.17 
The left hand scale of the speed table is mass.  Notice that our example regulated take-off mass 
of 57 900 kg lies between the 55 000 kg and 60 000 kg marks.  Therefore interpolation must 
be used when working out our V speeds.  V1 for 55 000 kg is 138 knots and for 60 000 kg V1 is 
145.  Correct interpolation for 57 900 kg would make V1 equal to 142.06 knots which should be 
rounded but we will do this shortly. 
Carrying out the same exercise for VR and V2 makes VR for 57 900 kg equal to 145 knots and V2 
equal to 152 knots.  
However, V1 must be corrected for slope and wind as shown in the table at the top of the page 
18 and this is reproduced for you in Figure 14.18.

Class A Aircraft - Take-off

Class A Aircraft - Take-off
Figure 14.18 Slope & wind adjustment for V1.
For a 2% upslope and a mass of 57 900 kg, interpolation shows that V1 must be increased by 
1.79 knots.  For a 20 knot headwind, V1 must be increased by 0.5 of a knot.  Therefore the total 
correction to V1 is to increase it by 2.29 knots.  Adding 2.29 knots to the original V1 of 142.06 
that we calculated earlier makes V1 to be 144.35 knots, which is rounded to 144 knots.  Having 
finished with V1, VR and V2, there are two other speeds to check.  The first is VMCG.
Looking further down the page you can see the table for calculating VMCG which is reproduced 
for you in Figure 14.19.
×
Figure 14.19 The VMCG table
Using 25°C and 2000 ft as our pressure altitude would make VMCG to be 112 knots.  Remember 
from our theory that V1 must not be less than VMCG and in our example it is not.
Lastly the speed VMBE also needs calculating.  The graph for this is on page 15 of section 4 of 
CAP 698.  We have already described this graph and how to use it.  Using Figure 14.14, if we use 
our example airfield conditions of 2000 ft pressure altitude, 25°C and our regulated take-off 
mass of 57 900 kg then the graph would not be applicable as we are in the shaded area. But as 
an example, VMBE is 175 knots.   However, there are some corrections to make.  In our example 
we had a 2% upslope, and this means we need to increase VMBE by 4 knots.  There is also a wind 
correction to be made.  In our example we assume a 20 knot headwind and this means VMBE 
must increase by 6 knots.  The total correction would increase VMBE to 185 knots.

All the relevant take-off V speeds have now been calculated based upon our regulated take-off 
mass of 57 900 kg.
Correction for Stopway and Clearway
The speeds shown in the tables that we have just used are based on a balanced field length 
(TORA = TODA= ASDA) and are not valid if the take-off mass has been derived using stopway 
or clearway.  Where this is the case the V1 may be adjusted for the effects of stopway or 
clearway from the table below.

Class A - Additional Take-off Procedures
Non-standard Take-off Procedures
The procedure to determine the take-off mass, take-off speeds, and thrust settings for the 
normal take-off procedure is given in the previous chapter.  Chapter 15 gives additional 
procedures to cover:
•	 take-off with contaminated runway
•	 take-off with increased V2 speed
•	 take-off with reduced thrust
•	 take-off with anti-skid inoperative
However, most of these procedures can be found in CAP 698 on pages 24 to 34 of section 4.  Do 
not worry about having to remember too much about these procedures, CAP 698 adequately 
details and describes not only the theory of the procedures but also the methodology of each 
procedure.
Contaminated Runways
This procedure is detailed on page 24 of section 4 in CAP 698.  A runway is considered to be 
contaminated when more than 25% of the runway surface area (whether in isolated areas or 
not) within the required length and width being used is covered by surface water, more than 
3 mm deep, or by slush or loose snow, equivalent to more than 3 mm of water.
Slush, loose snow or standing water on the runway will affect both the take-off distance 
required and the accelerate-stop distance required.  The take-off distance required will increase 
because of the additional wheel drag and impingement drag.  The accelerate-stop distance 
will increase because of the increased distance to accelerate and the increased distance to 
stop resulting from the reduced runway coefficient of braking friction.  For given distances 
available, the maximum take-off mass and V1 will therefore be reduced compared to the dry 
runway.  The greater the depth of contamination, the greater the mass reduction and the less 
the V1 reduction.
The  supplementary  performance  information  required  by  EU-OPS 1  should  include 
accelerate-stop  distance,  take-off  distance  and  take-off  run  appropriate  to  the  relevant 
contaminant, derived in a similar manner to those distances with a wet runway.
The acceleration distance should take account of the additional drag due to the gear 
displacement drag, and the spray impingement drag, and the decrease of drag which occurs 
above the aquaplaning speed.   For rotating tyres or tyres going from a dry surface to a flooded 
surface, the hydroplaning speed (VP) is calculated using the formula below

The hydroplaning speed for non-rotating tyres or to find the speed below which the aquaplaning 
will stop is shown below.
Figure 15.2 
Procedure
Use either Figure 15.3 or the tables shown in CAP 698 on pages 25, 26 and 27 of section 4 for 
the following description of the procedure to follow for contaminated runways.
The determination of take-off mass
a) 	
Calculate the normal limiting take-off mass for a dry runway i.e. field length limit, climb 
limit or obstacle limit.
b) 	
Select the table(s) appropriate to the depth of contaminant (interpolating if necessary).
c) 	
Enter the left column of the top table at the normal limiting take-off mass, travel right 
to the aerodrome pressure altitude column. Interpolate for mass and pressure altitude, 
if necessary. Extract the mass reduction. Calculate maximum take-off mass for a 
contaminated runway by subtracting the mass reduction from the normal performance 
limiting take-off mass.
d) 	
If in the shaded area, proceed to the bottom table. Enter the left column with the take-
off run available (TORA), move right to the appropriate aerodrome pressure altitude 
column. Interpolate as necessary. Extract the maximum permissible take-off mass. Make 
V1 = VMCG.
e) 	
The lower of the two values from c) and d) above is the maximum take-off mass for a 
contaminated runway.
f) 	
Calculate all the V speeds for the actual take-off mass as given in e). 
g) 	
If not in the shaded area in c) above, then re-enter the top table at the actual mass to 
determine the V1 reduction to be made.
h) 	
Apply the reduction to V1. If adjusted V1 is less than VMCG, take-off is not permitted.

Class A - Additional Take-off Procedures
Take-off with Increased V2 Speed
This particular procedure is used when the performance limited mass is the climb limit mass. 
In other words, the climb performance is poor and is severely restricting the potential mass 
of the aeroplane.  Before we start, it is important to understand that in the event of engine 
failure, the initial climb out speed is V2.  However, V2 is not the best climb angle speed.  V2 is 
considerably slower than the best angle of climb speed, which, if you recall, is called VX.  As an 
example, for a typical new generation 737, VX is 80 knots faster than V2; therefore, climbing out 
at V2 produces a climb angle much less than if the aeroplane were to climb out at VX.
What the improved climb procedure aims to achieve is to increase V2 to be closer to VX.  This 
will greatly enhance the climb performance.  Understanding the concepts of the increased V2 
procedure would be best illustrated by working through an example where the field limit mass 
is 61 000 kg and the climb limit mass is 52 000 kg.  The performance limited mass is always the 
lower mass and therefore the mass for take-off must be 52 000 kg.  This is a shame, since the 
runway can allow a far greater mass.  Therefore, taking off with only 52 000 kg would mean 
there would be a significant proportion of the runway left.  This can provide a clue as to the 
solution.
With all the excess of runway it would be possible to stay on the runway for longer during 
the take-off to build up more speed; this will ensure that at rotation and at the screen height, 
a faster V2 will be reached and this faster V2 will be much closer to VX.  This ensures that the 
climb performance significantly improves.  As a result of the improved climb performance, the 
climb limit mass can increase, which would increase the performance limited take-off mass and 
provide an improved regulated take-off mass.
The information at the top of page 28 of section 4 in CAP 698 introduces the concept of 
the procedure very well, so use this introduction in the exam if you are unsure of what the 
procedure entails.  Below this introduction is the detailed methodology of the procedure itself 
which is reproduced in the next paragraph.
Procedure
Use the graphs shown in CAP 698 on pages 29 and 30 of section 4 for the following procedure 
for an increased V2 take-off. 
a) 	
Select the set of graphs appropriate to the flap setting on the “improved climb 
performance field length limit” graph (CAP 698 Figure 4.15).
b) 	
Enter the relevant left-hand graph with the value of the field length limit mass minus 
the climb limit mass. Travel vertically up to the normal ‘climb limit’ mass line.
c) 	
From this intersection move horizontally left to the vertical axis to read the climb mass 
improvement and horizontally right to the vertical axis to read the increase to apply to 
V1.
d) 	
Continue horizontally right to the reference line of the right-hand graph. From this 
point interpolate and follow the grid lines to reach a vertical input in the right-hand 
graph of the normal climb limit mass.
e) 	
From this intersection, travel horizontally right to the vertical axis to read the increase 
to apply to VR and V2.

f) 	
Repeat this process in the improved climb performance tyre speed limit graph (CAP 698 
Figure 4.16) except that the initial entry point is the tyre limit mass minus the climb limit 
mass.
g) 	
The lower of the two mass increases is that which must be used together with its 
associated speed increases.
h) 	
Add the mass increase to the normal climb mass limit.
i) 	
Determine the V speeds for this increased mass.
j) 	
Apply the speed increases to the appropriate speeds. Check VMBE.
Take-off with Reduced Thrust
The third additional type of procedure is probably the most common and it is referred to by 
many different names and is detailed on page 31 of section 4 in CAP 698.  Use this page to help 
you, it describes all the relevant information you need.  So again, do not worry about having to 
remember all the information about it.  
This third procedure is referred to as the reduced thrust take-off, variable thrust take-off or 
assumed temperature take-off. However, Airbus uses the term flexible take-off.  The main 
reason for doing this procedure is to preserve engine life and also to help reduce noise.  The 
procedure can be used any time the actual take-off mass is less than the maximum permissible 
take-off mass and there is an available distance that greatly exceeds that which is required.  The 
maximum reduction in thrust from the full rated take-off thrust value is 25%.  
Take-off with reduced thrust is not permitted with:
•	 icy or very slippery runways
•	 contaminated runways
•	 anti-skid inoperative
•	 reverse thrust inoperative
•	 increased V2 procedure
•	 PMC off
Reduced thrust take-off procedure is not recommended if potential windshear conditions exist.
Procedure
Essentially this procedure assumes that the temperature is a lot hotter than it actually is.  Imagine 
for the moment that the outside air temperature was continually increasing and as a result the 
thrust produced by the engines continually decreasing. There will eventually be a temperature 
beyond which there will be insufficient thrust to complete a take-off.  This temperature is then 
used as the assumed temperature and the thrust equating to this temperature is then set as 
the take-off thrust.
The procedure described below can also be found in CAP 698 on page 31 of section 4.
--- Page 424 ---
Class A - Additional Take-off Procedures

15
Class A - Additional Take-off Procedures
It is first necessary to determine the most limiting performance condition. The only common 
parameter to enable comparison is that of temperature. Thus the maximum permissible 
temperature must be calculated for the actual take-off mass from each of the following:
•	 field limit graph
•	 climb limit graph
•	 tyre speed limit graph
•	 obstacle limit graph
From these temperatures, select the lowest and ensure that it does not exceed the environmental 
limit. If it does, then the environmental limit becomes the assumed temperature.
a) 	
Calculate the maximum assumed temperature from CAP 698 Figure 4.17a or 4.17b, as 
appropriate. Enter the left column with the actual ambient temperature and read the 
maximum temperature in the column appropriate to the aerodrome pressure altitude.
b) 	
From CAP 698 Figure 4.17c on the bottom line, determine the minimum assumed 
temperature for the aerodrome pressure altitude.
c) 	
From the same table, for the assumed temperature to be used, determine the maximum 
take-off % N1. Add 1.0% N1 if air conditioning packs are off. The assumed temperature 
used must neither exceed the maximum from paragraph a) above nor be below the 
minimum from paragraph b) above.
d)	
 Enter the left column of CAP 698 Figure 4.17d with assumed temperature minus 
ambient temperature. Travel right along the line to the column appropriate to the 
ambient temperature, interpolating if necessary. Read the % N1 adjustment.
e)	
Subtract the value determined at paragraph d) from that at paragraph c) to determine 
the % N1 to be set at take-off.
De-rate
Both Airbus and Boeing use De-rated thrust which will reduce engine thrust by a fixed 
percentage, for example De-rate 1 will reduce thrust by 4% and De-rate 2 by 10%.
When De-rate thrust is used it provides a fixed reduction of thrust and because it is fixed then 
VMCG and VMCA can also be reduced which can help increase take-off mass on a short runway. 
However, once De-rate is selected thrust cannot be increased until the aeroplane is accelerated 
during flap retraction.
Take-off with Anti-skid Inoperative
(Simplified Method)
The last additional take-off procedure is that used when the anti-skid system is inoperative. 
You may think that this is not important for take-off, but bear in mind, Class A aeroplanes 
have to demonstrate that in the event of engine failure, the aeroplane is able to stop within 
the confines of the runway.  Therefore, the accelerate-stop distance required must be less than 
or equal to the field available.  If the anti-skid system does not work, then the stopping ability 
will be severely reduced and will cause the accelerate-stop distance to increase dramatically. 
To solve the problem, V1 is reduced.  You may recall that reducing V1 decreases the accelerate-

Class A - Additional Take-off Procedures
stop distance, but the side effect is that it increases the take-off distance (Figure 14.1).  To 
resolve this, the mass of the aeroplane is reduced, which will decrease both the accelerate-stop 
distance and take-off distance required so that they remain within the available field lengths.
In summary then, with the anti-skid system inoperative, V1 and aeroplane mass must be 
decreased.
The anti-skid inoperative procedure is detailed on page 34 of section 4 in CAP 698.  At the 
top of that page is a very clear introduction to the procedure and below this is the method of 
calculating the mass and V1 reduction.

Class A - Take-off Climb
Take-off Climb
The take-off climb or take-off flight path extends from 35 ft above the take-off surface to 
1500 ft above the take-off surface.  However, with a contaminated runway take-off, the take-
off climb begins at 15 ft and not 35 ft.  The point on the ground directly below the 35 ft screen 
is called “reference zero”.  There are two main requirements that must be met within the take-
off climb and these requirements are based upon an engine failure occurring at VEF.  Remember 
that performance of Class A aeroplanes must account for engine failure in all flight phases.  
The first requirement is that the aeroplane must be able to achieve the minimum climb 
gradients and secondly the aeroplane must be able to maintain sufficient obstacle clearance. 
Remember that the climb gradient requirements are air based gradients and the obstacle 
clearance requirement use ground based gradients.
When assessing compliance with the regulations, the manufacturer or operator may either use a 
continuous demonstrated take-off climb or a segmented take-off climb.  Segmenting the take-off 
climb does make the requirements and the procedure a little easier to comprehend; therefore, 
we will use a segmented take-off climb profile as do most operators and manufacturers.
Segments of the Take-off Climb
The take-off climb is generally split into four unique segments and these are shown in Figure 
16.1.  Each segment is characteristic of a distinct change in aeroplane configuration, speed 
and/or thrust with various actions and climb gradient requirements. Generally there are four 
segments and you will need to learn what unique characteristics define each segment.

Segment 1
The take-off flight path starts once the take-off is complete, in other words at 35 ft with the 
aeroplane at V2 with one engine inoperative.  The 35 ft screen marks the start point of segment 
1.  The objective at this point is to climb, as expeditiously as possible, which is difficult because 
of the lack of excess thrust due to the large amount of drag created by the gear and flaps 
and the fact that one engine is deemed inoperative.  Therefore, the strategy is to retract the

Class A - Take-off Climb
gear and flaps as soon as possible.  Since retracting flaps at low speeds close to the ground is 
dangerous, the only option is to retract the gear.
Once the gear is up and locked then the first segment is finished.  During this segment the 
steady gradient of climb must be positive. 
Segment 2
The second segment starts at the end of the first segment, i.e. when the gear is up.  The 
objective now is to retract the flaps.  However, flap retraction is not permitted below 400 ft, 
therefore the action by the pilot is simply to climb, at no less than V2, until 400 ft is reached. 
Once 400 ft is reached and flap retract can commence, segment 2 ends.  Since the aeroplane 
has had the main source of drag removed, the minimum gradient requirement is more severe 
at no less than 2.4%.
Segment 3
Segment three starts at or above 400 ft and is the flap retraction and acceleration segment. 
However, retracting the flaps will increase the stall speed.  This reduces the aeroplane’s safety 
margin.  Therefore, the aeroplane must accelerate during flap retraction from V2 to the zero 
flap speed and then to the final take-off speed. The final take-off speed is also called the 
final segment speed and is intended to be the one engine inoperative best angle of climb 
speed.  Once this has happened, thrust can be reduced from maximum take-off thrust, TOGA, 
to maximum continuous thrust, MCT.  In fact, maximum take-off thrust is limited to only 10 
minutes, therefore, acceleration and flap retraction must be complete by then.  We require 
excess thrust to enable us to climb or accelerate and as our priority in this segment is to 
accelerate there is no minimum climb gradient required. The only way we can quantify this 
acceleration requirement, is by stating that the excess thrust available would be equivalent to 
a minimum climb gradient of 1.2%. 
Segment 4
The fourth segment starts when the flaps are retracted, the final segment speed is achieved 
and the thrust is set to maximum continuous thrust.  From this point the aeroplane is climbed 
to above 1500 ft where the take-off flight path ends.  The pilot will either recover to the airfield 
or continue to his take-off alternate. The climb gradient for this last stage must not be less than 
1.2%.
The gradient requirements for Class A aeroplanes with more than two engines form part of 
the syllabus and therefore they need to be remembered as well.  Although we have already 
mentioned it in the previous chapter, the climb limit mass tells us what the maximum mass 
of the aeroplane can be in order to achieve the minimum gradient requirements.  Having a 
mass greater than the climb limit mass would mean that the aeroplane will not have sufficient 
performance in the event of engine failure to achieve the climb gradient requirements.  The 
graph to calculate the climb limit mass is on page 11 of section 4 in CAP 698.  We have worked 
through an example in the previous chapter, but none the less ensure you are confident in 
being able to use this graph.  The introduction to the climb section, shown on page 10 of 
section 4 reiterates the climb requirements and it states that during the take-off climb the 
aeroplane must:
a.	
Attain the most severe gradient requirement of the take-off net flight path, and 
b.	
Avoid all obstacles in the obstacle accountability area by the statutory minimum vertical 
interval.

Class A - Take-off Climb
Both these requirements have already been mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.  The 
climb limit mass deals with point a.  In other words, being at or below the climb limit mass 
guarantees attainment of the most severe gradient requirement of the take-off flight path. 
What is the most severe angle of the take-off flight path?  The most severe gradient requirement 
is in segment 2, which for a twin engine jet aeroplane is 2.4%.  Therefore the climb limit mass 
ensures that the aeroplane, in the event of engine failure is able to attain a 2.4% gradient or 
more.  Remember that these climb gradients are air based and therefore independent of the 
effect of wind.  Looking through the climb limit mass graph confirms this since there is no wind 
component shown.
Obstacle Clearance
Having discussed the minimum climb gradient requirements and how to ensure the aeroplane 
attains them, we need to focus on the obstacle clearance requirements.  In EU-OPS it states 
that an operator must ensure that the net take-off flight path must clear all obstacles by a 
vertical margin of at least 35 ft.  If the aeroplane is unable to do so it must turn away from the 
obstacle and clear it by a horizontal distance of at least 90 m plus 0.125 × D, where D is the 
horizontal distance the aeroplane has travelled from the end of the take-off distance available. 
90 m + 0.125D
For aeroplanes with a wingspan of less than 60 m a horizontal obstacle clearance of half the 
aeroplane wingspan plus 60 m, plus 0.125 × D may be used.  
60 m + ½ wing span + 0.125D
However, obstacles further away than the values shown below need not be considered.
We have seen this horizontal clearance information before when we were discussing multi-
engine Class B obstacle clearance.  However, there are two crucial points to consider when 
trying to work out the vertical clearance.
The first relates to climb gradient, which, if you remember, is a ground based gradient.  In 
order to work out the obstacle clearance of the aeroplane, the climb gradient needs to be 
known.  But EU-OPS states that the climb gradient to use for the purpose of calculating 
obstacle clearance must be the net climb gradient.  Remember that the net gradient is the 
gross gradient diminished by a safety factor.  In this case the safety factor changes depending 
on the number of engines. 
The net gradient is the gross gradient reduced by:
0.8% for 2-engine aircraft
0.9% for 3-engine aircraft
1.0% for 4-engine aircraft
--- Page 434 ---

Class A - Take-off Climb
Using the net gradient instead of the gross gradient in the take-off flight path will produce a 
net take-off flight path.  As we stated at the beginning, the net take-off flight path must clear 
all obstacles by 35 ft. 
The second point to consider is the effect of wind on the ground gradient.  Headwinds will 
increase the ground gradient and improve obstacle clearance,  whereas tailwinds will decrease 
the ground gradient and deteriorate the obstacle clearance.  EU-OPS states that when adjusting 
for wind to calculate the ground gradient, no more than 50% of the reported headwind and 
no less than 150% of the reported tailwind must be used.  Carrying out this rule simply adds 
another safety margin into the calculation.
We stated that if the aeroplane is unable to clear the obstacle vertically, then it can turn away 
from the obstacle and clear it horizontally.  However, there are restrictions on how much the 
aeroplane is allowed to turn.  Clearly it is not safe if the aeroplane needs to bank sharply 
to clear the obstacle by the regulatory margins.  Turning can increase the effective weight 
by imposing extra g loads and therefore the climb gradient is reduced and stall speeds are 
increased.  Allowance must be made for the effect of the turn on the climb gradient and speed. 
The flight manual usually gives a gradient decrement for a 15° banked turn at V2.  For greater 
bank angles:
•	 For 20° bank, use 2 × gradient decrement and V2 + 5 kt
•	 For 25° bank, use 3 × gradient decrement and V2 + 10 kt
Turns on the Flight Path
•	 Turns are not allowed below a height of half the wingspan or 50 ft whichever is greater.
•	 Up to 400 ft, bank angle may not be more than 15°.
•	 Above 400 ft, bank angle may not be more than 25°.
EU-OPS 1.495 does permit operators to exceed these bank angles providing that the operator 
uses special procedures and that these procedures have been approved by the relevant 
authority.  The special procedures must take account of the gradient loss from such bank angles 
and these must be published in the aeroplane flight manual.  The maximum bank angles that 
the special procedures allow are up to 20° between 200 and 400 ft and up to 30 ° between 400 
and 1500 ft.
If any turn of more than 15° is required at any point in the take-off flight path, then the vertical 
clearance is increased to 50 ft instead of 35 ft.  Manually working out the obstacle clearance 
capability of the aeroplane could take a long time, since there are so many points to bear in 
mind and the calculation itself is quiet lengthy.  Thankfully, most operators and manufactures 
have produced either rapid look-up tables or graphs to quickly enable the pilot to work out 
if an obstacle in the take-off climb will be cleared by the relevant vertical margins following 
engine failure.  These tables or graphs will produce a mass.  This mass is called the obstacle limit 
mass and an example is shown in Figure 16.2 which can also be found in CAP 698 on pages 
36 and 37 of section 4.  It is the maximum mass that will allow the aeroplane, in the event of 
engine failure, to clear the obstacle by the relevant vertical margin.
Notice that winds are included on the graph.  This is important because obstacle clearance 
calculations must use ground gradients and these are dependent on wind.  In fact, remember 
that EU-OPS had a rule about the wind.  It stated that when using the winds to work out the 
ground gradient only use 50% of headwinds and no less than 150% tailwinds.  Notice the 
slope of the headwind and tailwind lines.  This shows that the graph applies the wind rule for 
you.  Therefore, if you enter the graph with the actual reported wind, the graph corrects it 
automatically so you do not need to.

Once the details of the obstacle have been entered, as shown by the example, the obstacle 
limit mass can be read off, and, in the example on the graph itself the obstacle limit mass is 
51 700 kg.  Taking off with a higher mass than this would not ensure adequate vertical clearance. 
However, if this mass unduly restricts the take-off mass, then the aeroplane may be despatched 
with a greater mass so long as the aeroplane turns around the obstacle, clearing it by the 
relevant horizontal margins and does not exceed the turn restrictions when trying to do so.
Noise Abatement Procedures
Aeroplane operating procedures for the take-off climb shall ensure that the necessary safety of 
flight operations is maintained whilst minimizing exposure to noise on the ground.
The first procedure (NADP 1) is intended to provide noise reduction for noise-sensitive areas in 
close proximity to the departure end of the runway (see Figure 16.3).  The second procedure 
(NADP 2) provides noise reduction to areas more distant from the runway end (see Figure 
16.4). The two procedures differ in that the acceleration segment for flap/slat retraction is 
either initiated prior to reaching the maximum prescribed height or at the maximum prescribed 
height. To ensure optimum acceleration performance, thrust reduction may be initiated at an 
intermediate flap setting.

NADP 1 
This procedure involves a power reduction at or above the prescribed minimum altitude and 
the delay of flap/slat retraction until the prescribed maximum altitude is attained.  At the 
prescribed maximum altitude, accelerate and retract flaps/slats on schedule whilst maintaining 
a positive rate of climb, and complete the transition to normal en route climb speed.
The noise abatement procedure is not to be initiated at less than 800 ft above aerodrome 
elevation.  The initial climbing speed to the noise abatement initiation point shall not be less 
than V2 plus 20 km/h (10 kt).  On reaching an altitude at or above 800 ft above aerodrome 
elevation, adjust and maintain engine power/thrust in accordance with the noise abatement 
power/thrust schedule provided in the aircraft operating manual.  Maintain a climb speed of V2 
plus 20 to 40 km/h (10 to 20 kt) with flaps and slats in the take-off configuration.
At no more than an altitude equivalent to 3000 ft above aerodrome elevation, whilst 
maintaining a positive rate of climb, accelerate and retract flaps/slats on schedule.  At 3000 ft 
above aerodrome elevation, accelerate to en route climb speed.

NADP 2
This procedure involves initiation of flap/slat retraction on reaching the minimum prescribed 
altitude.  The flaps/slats are to be retracted on schedule whilst maintaining a positive rate 
of climb.  The power reduction is to be performed with the initiation of the first flap/slat 
retraction or when the zero flap/slat configuration is attained.  At the prescribed altitude, 
complete the transition to normal en route climb procedures.
The noise abatement procedure is not to be initiated at less than 800 ft above aerodrome 
elevation.  The initial climbing speed to the noise abatement initiation point is V2 plus 20 to 
40 km/h (10 to 20 kt).  On reaching an altitude equivalent to at least 800 ft above aerodrome 
elevation, decrease aircraft body angle/angle of pitch whilst maintaining a positive rate of 
climb, accelerate towards VZF and either:
•	 reduce power with the initiation of the first flap/slat retraction; or
•	 reduce power after flap/slat retraction.
Maintain a positive rate of climb, and accelerate to and maintain a climb speed of VZF + 20 
to 40 km/h (10 to 20 kt) to 3000 ft above aerodrome elevation.  On reaching 3000 ft above 
aerodrome elevation, transition to normal en route climb speed.

Class A - En Route
En Route Phase
The en route phase of flight starts at 1500 ft above the departure aerodrome and ends once 
the aeroplane has reached 1500 ft above the intended destination aerodrome.  As with 
other phases of flight for Class A aeroplanes, the en route regulations account for engine 
failure.  Therefore, manufacturers and operators of Class A aeroplanes must ensure that the 
performance of the aeroplane subsequent to engine failure is still able to meet the regulation 
requirements. 
Firstly we will discus the climb to the en route altitude, then we will detail the en route 
altitudes and how they are calculated as well as discussing various flight speeds. Lastly we will 
detail the descent, both normal descent, and the descent forced by either engine failure or 
depressurization.
Climb Profile / Climb Schedule
After a normal take-off, climbing to the en route altitude is a straightforward affair.  Once the 
aeroplane configuration is clean, a set climb profile or climb schedule will be flown.  Initially 
the aeroplane climbs at a constant indicated airspeed.  However, continuously climbing at a 
constant indicated airspeed causes the Mach number to rise.  Beyond a certain altitude, the 
Mach number gets too high and serious aerodynamic forces start to affect the aeroplane.  In 
the 737 family the maximum Mach number, MMO is 0.82.  Therefore, at some lower altitude the 
aeroplane needs to change its climb profile to a constant Mach number climb.  The altitude at 
which this change occurs is called the crossover or changeover altitude.
In brief summary then, the climb profile involves the aeroplane initially climbing at a constant 
indicated airspeed, and then at the crossover altitude, the aeroplane climbs at a constant Mach 
number.  However, ICAO limits the maximum indicated airspeed to 250 knots below 10 000 ft. 
For the majority of the 737 family, the climb profile is 250 knots indicated airspeed up to 10 000 
ft, then the aeroplane is accelerated to 280 knots and the climb continued at 280 knots.  As the 
aeroplane climbs, the Mach number will increase and when the Mach number reaches 0.74, the 
aeroplane maintains a climb speed of 0.74 until the en route cruise altitude. Using Figure 17.1 
you will notice that the crossover altitude is at about 25 700 ft.
Figure 17.1

Class A - En Route
However, you need to understand what happens to the crossover altitude if a faster indicated 
airspeed climb is maintained, and for this example we will increase the second part of the 
indicated airspeed climb from 280 to 325 knots.  Looking at Figure 17.2, initially the aeroplane 
will still climb at 250 knots, but, once reaching 10 000 ft the aeroplane will be accelerated to 
325 knots and then climb at 325 knots.  Once the Mach number has increased to 0.74, then the 
aeroplane climbs at 0.74.  Notice now the crossover altitude is lower at 18 000 ft.  Therefore 
if the indicated airspeed is increased in the climb profile, the crossover altitude decreases to a 
lower altitude.
Figure 17.2 A typical climb schedule using a faster indicated airspeed
Cruise Speeds
Before we proceed to discuss the en route altitude, it is important at this point to briefly detail 
a few important speeds, most of which you have already covered.  These speeds are commonly 
expressed as Mach numbers.  The first of these speeds is the maximum operating speed, either 
called VMO when using indicated airspeed or MMO when using Mach numbers.  For the majority 
of the 737 family VMO is 340 knots and MMO is 0.82.  Flying beyond these speeds in a commercial 
operational context is not permitted and may cause either structural damage or a high speed 
stall.
The next two speeds are used in reference to describing the range of the aeroplane and were 
mentioned in the en route chapter of the general performance principles section. These two 
speeds are the maximum range cruise speed, MRC, and long range cruise speed, LRC.  When 
these speeds are referenced in terms of a Mach number the abbreviation is changed to MMR 
(Mach number for maximum range) and MLRC (Mach number for long range cruise) respectively.

Class A - En Route
As you can see from Figure 17.3, plotting cost and speed, the advantage of flying at the maximum 
range speed is simply that the aeroplane will use the least amount of fuel and therefore have 
the least fuel cost for a given distance.  However, operationally, the faster “long range cruise” 
is used.  The simple reason why this speed is used is because by getting to destination more 
quickly, more revenue earning flights can be carried out in any given period. In other words, 
over a given time period 4% more flights can be carried out with only a fuel consumption 
increase of 1%.  The long range cruise speed does suffer from limitations.  It does not take 
into account the variable cost of fuel from day to day or month to month and neither does it 
account for the operational costs.  When fuel prices are high, the extra fuel consumption may 
dramatically increase the overall cost of the flight and a more operationally economical speed 
may need to be flown. The relationship of these costs is explained by the use of a cost index 
and the speed flown based upon the cost index is called “ECON”.  This will be discussed next.
Figure 17.3 A graph showing the relation between the long range cruise speed (LRC) & 
the maximum range cruise speed (MRC)
Cost Index
The fundamental rationale of the cost index concept is to achieve minimum operation trip 
cost by means of a trade-off between time-related costs and fuel-related costs. The cost index 
is used to take into account the relationship between fuel-related costs and time-related 
costs.  With time-related costs, the faster the aircraft is flown, the more money is saved in 
time costs. This is because the faster the aircraft is flown, the more miles can be flown for 
time-related components.  It also means that more miles can be flown between inspections 
when considering maintenance costs.  These costs are minimum at the maximum operating 
speed VMO/MMO.  However, if the aircraft is flown at such a high speed, the fuel burn increases 
and total fuel cost for the trip increases.  Fuel costs on the other hand will be minimum at the 
maximum range cruise speed (MRC) and maximum at the maximum operating speed.  Adding 
the time-related costs and fuel-related costs together produces a direct operating cost, or more 
simplistically, a total operating cost. The flight management system uses the time and fuel-
related costs to help select the best speed to fly.

Figure 17.4 A graph plotting the operating costs of the aeroplane against the 
aeroplane speed
Looking at Figure 17.4 you can see from the total cost curve that the speed which gives the 
minimum total operating cost is the most economical speed to fly.  This speed is called ECON, in 
other words the minimum cost speed.  The value of the ECON speed is worked out by the flight 
management system based upon the value of the cost index.  As a formula the cost index is a 
ratio of cost of time, CT, to the cost of fuel, CF.
  
When fuel costs are high and time costs are very low, the cost index would be almost zero and 
the blue total cost line is moved to the left.  The intersection point of the other cost lines will 
lie very close to the maximum range cruise speed giving a cost index of zero. The ECON speed 
(found at the bottom of the blue line) would now be at the maximum range speed (see Figure 
17.5).  When time costs are high and fuel costs are low, the cost index would be very high 
and the blue total cost line moves to the far right of the graph.  The ECON speed, found at 
the bottom of the blue curve would now be very close to the maximum operating speed (see 
Figure 17.6).
To summarize then, increasing the cost index from zero to maximum will increase the ECON 
speed from the maximum range speed to maximum operating speed.  For most aeroplanes the 
cost index varies from zero to 99 or from zero to 999.

Cruise Altitudes
Once the aeroplane has completed the climb profile and has reached the top of the climb, 
the aeroplane will level off at the appropriate altitude.  This cruise altitude should ideally 
coincide with optimum altitude.  You may recall that the optimum altitude was the altitude 
for maximum specific range or maximum fuel mileage.  As a general rule, this altitude is not 
constant.  As weight decreases during the flight from fuel consumption, the optimum altitude 
increases, as illustrated in the Figure 17.7. 
Figure 17.7 A graph showing important altitudes for a typical medium range jet
Therefore, to constantly fly at the optimum altitude, the aeroplane will not actually fly level, 
but will in fact slowly be climbing in the cruise.  On the other hand, ATC restrictions require 
level flight cruise to ensure vertical separation with other aeroplanes.  To try and accommodate 
ATC in congested airspace aircraft must fly by segments of constant altitude which must be as 
close as possible to the optimum altitude.  The level segments are established within 2000 ft 
from the optimum altitude.   The procedure is called the step climb which you have seen in the 
General Principles-Cruise chapter.  Remaining within 2000 ft of the optimum altitude ensures 
the range is 99% of the maximum specific range.  There may be several step climbs during the 
flight and the aeroplane will be gaining altitude throughout this process.  However, there is a 
limit to how high the aeroplane is permitted to operate and able to operate.

Class A - En Route
As the aeroplane altitude increases, the thrust that is required to maintain a given speed 
increases.  Eventually, there will be an altitude where the thrust is increased to its maximum 
cruise value and it would not be possible to climb any higher without exceeding the thrust 
limits.  This altitude is called the maximum altitude and is shown in Figure 17.7.  However, the 
hotter the atmosphere, the lower this altitude becomes and in exceptionally hot atmospheres 
the maximum altitude is almost the same as the optimum altitude.   Although the aeroplane 
cannot operate above the maximum altitude, there are other altitude limits placed upon the 
aeroplane.
Aerodynamic Ceiling and Manoeuvre Ceiling
Before we can discuss the other limits on the operating altitude of an aeroplane it is important 
to discuss aeroplane stalling.  When the speed of the aeroplane is reduced, in order to still 
produce enough lift to balance weight, the angle of attack must increase.  However, below 
a certain speed, the angle of attack on the wings is such that the flow of air over the wing 
starts to separate from the boundary layer producing turbulent air flow.  The separation point 
fluctuates back and forth along the wing making strong eddies in the turbulent airflow.   These 
strong eddies buffet the elevators or tailplane. This phenomenon is called the low speed buffet. 
Flying below this speed will dramatically decrease the lift and a full stall ensues. 
 
Figure 17.8 The relationship of the Mach number for the low speed & high speed buffets with altitude
For a given weight and configuration, the aeroplane will always stall at the same indicated 
airspeed but the equivalent Mach number for the low speed buffet and stall increases with 
altitude as illustrated by a simplistic graph shown in Figure 17.8.  The Mach number for the 
low speed buffet is abbreviated to MMIN.  A similar buffet can occur at high speed.  At very 
high speeds, close to the speed of sound, the compressibility of the air ahead of the aeroplane 
leads to the formation of shock waves or high pressure waves.  These shock waves create a 
disturbance to the flow of air over the wing causing it to separate and create turbulent eddies. 
Similar to the low speed buffet these eddies will buffet the elevator.  This phenomenon is called 
the high speed buffet. Flying faster than this speed may cause a high speed shock stall in an 
aeroplane whose wings are not designed to overcome such effects.  The Mach number for
--- Page 456 ---
Class A - En Route
17

17
Class A - En Route
the high speed buffet decreases with increasing altitude, as shown.  This speed is commonly 
abbreviated to MMAX and is shown by the backward sloping red line to the right of the graph 
in Figure 17.8.
Taking into consideration the Mach numbers for both low speed and high speed buffet, it 
means that there are two Mach numbers, below and above which the aeroplane is unable to 
fly.  This speed range between the Mach numbers for the low speed stall and high speed stall 
is called the buffet margin. The important point to understand is that the margin between 
the low speed and high speed buffets decreases with increasing altitude.  There is an altitude 
where the low speed and high speed buffets are equal under 1g conditions and it is impossible 
to fly higher than this altitude. Flying slower or faster than the speed shown will stall the 
aeroplane.  In fact, even manoeuvring the aeroplane will initiate a stall because manoeuvring 
the aeroplane will increase the effective weight and increase the stall speed.  This altitude is 
called the aerodynamic ceiling, or coffin corner.  To prevent aeroplanes from operating too 
close to this altitude, an operational limit is set below this point.  Notice that a 1.3g manoeuvre 
moves the buffet speed lines to the faded red position in Figure 17.8.  Notice also that now, 
the Mach numbers for the low speed and high speed buffets are coincident at a lower altitude. 
This altitude is called the 1.3g buffet limit altitude or manoeuvre ceiling and is usually about 
4000 to 6000 ft below the aerodynamic ceiling.
Buffet Onset
To more accurately calculate the high and low speed buffets or the buffet boundary, a pilot 
uses the buffet onset chart found within the aircraft flight manual.  An example of such a 
chart, taken from Airbus, is shown in Figure 17.9.   The following information describes the 
process of calculating the Manoeuvre (1.3g) and Aerodynamic Ceilings (1.0g).
1.3g Altitude (1g  +  0.3g  =  1.3g):  At this altitude a ‘g’ increment of 0.3 can be sustained 
without buffet occurring.  Using the data supplied:
Follow the vertical solid red line upwards from 1.3g to the 110 tons line, then horizontally to 
the 30% CG vertical line, then parallel to the CG reference line, again horizontally to the M 
0.8 vertical line.  The altitude curve must now be ‘paralleled’ to read off the flight level of 
405.  The 1.3g altitude is 40 500 ft.
If the aircraft is operated above FL405 at this mass and CG, a gust, or bank angle of less than 
40°, could cause the aircraft to buffet.  (40° of bank at high altitude is excessive, a normal 
operational maximum at high altitude would be 10° to 15°).
Buffet restricted speed limits:  Using the data supplied:
Follow the vertical dashed red line upwards from 1g to the 110 tons line, then horizontally to 
the 30% CG vertical line, then parallel to the CG reference line.  Observe the FL 350 curve.  The 
curve does not reach the horizontal dashed red line at the high speed end because M 0.84 
(MMO) is the maximum operating speed limit.  At the low speed end of the dashed red line, 
the FL350 curve is intersected at M 0.555.  Thus under the stated conditions, the low speed 
buffet restriction is M 0.555 and there is no high speed buffet restriction because MMO is the 
maximum operating Mach number which may not be exceeded under any circumstances.

Aerodynamic ceiling:  at 150 tons can be determined by:
Initially following the vertical dashed red line vertically upwards from 1g, continue to the 
150 tons plot, then move horizontally to the left to M 0.8 (via the CG correction).  The 
interpolated altitude curve gives an aerodynamic ceiling of FL390.
Load factor and bank angle at which buffet occurs:  Using the data supplied:
From M 0.8, follow the dashed blue line to obtain 54° bank angle or 1.7g.

Normal Descent
When the aeroplane gets close to the destination airfield it will reach a point which marks the 
beginning of the descent.  This is called the top of descent.  You may remember that in order 
to initiate a descent, firstly the thrust must be reduced, and then the nose is lowered to get 
weight to act forwards to balance the drag.  The balance of forces ensures a constant speed 
can be maintained during the descent.  The descent profile is almost the reverse of the climb 
profile.  The climb for a typical 737 is initially flown at 250 knots, then at 10 000 ft this changes 
to 280 knots and then at the crossover altitude Mach 0.74 is maintained.  The descent is flown 
initially at Mach 0.74, then at the crossover altitude the speed is kept constant at 280 knots, but 
when 10 000 ft is reached no more than 250 knots must be flown.
Figure 17.10 A typical descent profile for a medium range jet
Shown in Figure 17.10 are the characteristics of the descent so you can see what happens to the 
gradient and rate of descent throughout the descent profile.  If at any point air traffic control 
asks the pilots to expedite the descent, then the only action by the pilots would be to deploy 
the speed brakes.  
This increases the drag, which must be balanced by more weight apparent thrust, therefore 
the nose is lowered which increases both the angle and rate of descent as per the instruction 
of air traffic control.  
The next descent to consider is the descent characteristic following either depressurization 
or engine failure.  In flight, engine or pressurization failures force a premature descent and 
therefore the performance becomes very constraining over mountainous areas.  
Depressurization
When we suffer a pressurization failure the procedure is a little different from the engine 
failure case. At high altitudes the oxygen pressure in the cabin will be insufficient to support 
life so oxygen will be provided for both crew and passengers through oxygen masks. However, 
the amount of oxygen carried is limited, therefore the aeroplane must descend, as rapidly as 
possible to 10 000 ft where there is sufficient oxygen pressure, before the oxygen supply runs

out.  The procedure involves configuring the aeroplane for the maximum rate of descent.  You 
may recall that in order to achieve a maximum rate of descent, excess power required has to 
be as large as possible.  Therefore drag must be high and speed must be high.  As a result, the 
first actions of the pilots are to don the oxygen masks, close the throttles, apply the speed 
brakes and then lower the nose to allow the aeroplane to accelerate to maximum operating 
speed which is either VMO or MMO.  This configuration is then maintained till at least 10 000 ft, or 
minimum safe en route altitude, where there is sufficient oxygen to breathe.
Engine Failure and Drift Down
In the case of an engine failure during flight, the remaining thrust is no longer sufficient to 
balance the drag force and therefore the cruise speed cannot be maintained.  The only solution 
is to descend to a lower flight altitude, where the remaining engine can provide enough 
thrust to balance the drag and allow level flight once more.  To achieve this, the aeroplane is 
initially flown level to allow the aeroplane to decelerate from the cruise speed to the velocity 
of minimum drag. At VMD the nose is lowered to maintain VMD , which can now be thought of 
as the “speed for minimum excess drag” as shown by Figure 17.11.  As the aeroplane descends 
into the lower atmosphere where density is greater, the remaining engine can develop more 
thrust which will eventually equal drag; this is the GROSS level-off altitude, but would give no 
performance margin, so the DRIFT DOWN PROCEDURE is continued to a lower altitude, the 
NET level-off altitude.  Figure 17.12 is a graph which allows flight crew to determine distance 
flown, and gross altitude, following engine failure. The current lines are the drift down profiles 
for various aircraft weights.
Figure 17.11 Changes to thrust & drag after engine failure
This procedure is called the drift down, and it produces a drift down profile.  This path must, of 
course, be above all relevant obstacles, but this will be discussed later.

Obstacle Clearance Requirements
One of the crucial points about the drift down procedure is the clearance of obstacles.  Because 
the aeroplane is forced to descend, terrain, such as mountains, may present a flight hazard. 
When assessing the terrain hazard a safety margin must be introduced.  When planning routes 
and planning the flight profile, it is not the gross flight profile that is used, but rather the net 
flight profile.  In other words, the flight profile must be made worse by a safety factor.  This 
safety factor is based on assuming a gradient of descent that is worse than the aeroplane can 
actually achieve.  For two-engine aeroplanes with one engine inoperative the gross gradient 
of descent is increased by 1.1%.  This increases to 1.4% for 3-engine aeroplanes and 1.6% for 
four-engine aeroplanes.
Figure 17.13 Net & gross descent profiles for a typical twin-engine medium range jet.
EU-OPS regulations state (in part):
The one engine inoperative en route net flight path must comply with either sub-paragraph (a) 
or (b) at all points along the route.
(a)	
The gradient of the net flight path must be positive at at least 1000 ft above all terrain 
and obstructions along the route within 5 NM on either side of the intended track.
	
If an aeroplane is unable to satisfy this restriction, or when it would be too limiting in 
terms of weight, a drift down procedure should be worked out, as detailed below:
(b)	
The net flight path must permit the aeroplane to continue flight from the cruising 
altitude to an aerodrome where a landing can be made, […], the net flight path clearing 
vertically, by at least 2000 ft, all terrain and obstructions along the route within [the 
prescribed corridor].

In addition:
The net flight path must have a positive gradient at 1500 ft above the aerodrome where the 
landing is assumed to be made after engine failure.
AND
Fuel jettisoning is permitted to an extent consistent with reaching the aerodrome with the 
required fuel reserves.
In order to find out if the aeroplane is able to level off at 1000 ft above an obstacle, use the 
graph in CAP 698 on page 40 of section 4.  This has been reproduced in Figure 17.14.

Simply enter the graph with the level-off altitude that is required (obstacle height AMSL + 1000 
ft) and the graph will show the mass that the aeroplane will need to be at in order to level off 
at that altitude.  In the example on the graph, in order to level off at 18 000 ft in an ISA + 20 
atmosphere the aeroplane would need to have a mass of just less than 48 000 kg.  If this is not 
possible, then other graphs, shown on pages 41 to 44 of CAP 698 must be used.  
These graphs are more complicated, but, importantly, they will enable the pilot to work out 
if the aeroplane can clear any obstacle in the flight path by 2000 ft.  When using these graphs 
be careful to adjust the weight of the aeroplane for any non-standard conditions and anti-ice 
use.  Notice that the heavier the aeroplane the longer and lower the drift down procedure is. 
Range Limit Following Engine Failure
After engine failure, the lower operating altitude significantly decreases the engine’s efficiency. 
So much so that the fuel-flow on the remaining engine is almost as much as the fuel flow with 
both engines operating at high altitude.  This fact, together with the reduced true airspeed, 
means that the specific range is dramatically decreased.  As a result of the reduced range it 
may not be possible to reach the destination airfield and in fact the priority now is to find an 
alternate airfield to land before the fuel runs out.  This issue is of such importance that it was 
necessary to regulate it.  The authorities have to set a safety standard that in the event of 
engine failure the aeroplane must have the capability of reaching a suitable airfield within a 
certain time period.
EU-OPS 1.245 states that twin engine aeroplanes beyond a certain size must be no further 
away from a suitable aerodrome than the distance flown in 60 minutes using the one engine 
operative cruise speed as TAS in still air.  For aeroplanes with 3 or more engines the time is 
increased to 90 minutes.  Therefore, at all points on the route a twin-engine aeroplane must be 
within 60 minutes of an alternate airfield.  
This regulation has a significant impact on flight routes, especially over the sea.   In the example 
in Figure 17.15 you can see that to comply with the 60 minute rule the aeroplane track must at 
all times be within the 60 minute range limit of a suitable alternate airfield.  From the diagram 
in Figure 17.15, a direct track to North America from Europe is not possible.

Figure 17.15 Range limits on twin medium range jets
However, as more and more reliable and efficient aeroplanes are produced, an extension to 
the 60 minute rule has been introduced.
ETOPS
The extension to the 60 minute rule is called “ETOPS” and it stands for Extended-range Twin-
engine Operational Performance Standards.  It hugely increases the operational capability of 
twin-engine aeroplanes where previously only aeroplanes with three or more engines could 
operate.  However, ETOPS must be applied for by the airlines concerned and approval gained 
from the appropriate aviation authority. 
To gain ETOPS approval, a greater range of performance parameters must be known and 
these accompany the application and are eventually published in the operating manual.  These 
include extra data for
•	 Area of Operation
•	 Critical Fuel Reserves
•	 Net Level-off Altitudes
Gaining an ETOPS approval of 120 minutes for example will greatly benefit flight tracks across 
the Atlantic Ocean, as shown in Figure 17.15.  The route from Paris to New York, for example, 
can now be flown direct by a twin jet aeroplane.  Currently, the longest ETOPS approval is given 
to the Boeing 777.  It holds an approval of 180 minutes with contingencies for 207 minutes over 
the Pacific.
In the future ETOPS may be evolving into a newer system, called LROPS.  LROPS stands for Long 
Range Operational Performance Standards, which will affect all aircraft, not just those with a 
twin-engine configuration.

Class A - Landing
Landing Considerations
The maximum mass for landing is the lesser of:
•	 the landing climb limit mass (maximum mass to achieve landing climb requirements)
•	 the field length limit mass
•	 the structural limit mass
Landing Climb Requirements
LANDING CLIMB  (All engines operating CS-25.119)
A gradient of not less than 3.2% with:
•	 All engines operating at the power available 8 seconds after initiation of movement of the 
thrust control from the minimum flight idle to the take-off position
•	 Landing configuration
•	 Aerodrome altitude
•	 Ambient temperature expected at the time of landing
•	 A climb speed of VREF
VREF:
•	 not less than VMCL
•	 not less than 1.23VSR0
•	 provides the manoeuvring capability specified in CS-25.143 (h)
DISCONTINUED APPROACH CLIMB  (One engine inoperative  CS-25.121 (d))
A climb gradient not less than:
•	 2.1% for 2 engine aircraft
•	 2.4% for 3 engine aircraft
•	 2.7% for 4 engine aircraft
With:	
•	 The critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines at go-around thrust
•	 Landing gear retracted
•	 Flaps in the approach configuration, provided that the approach flap VSR does not exceed 
110% of landing flap VSR
•	 Aerodrome altitude
•	 Ambient temperature 
•	 Speed: Normal approach speed but not greater than 1.4VSR.
•	 Maximum landing weight
The more limiting of the landing climb and the approach gradient requirements will determine 
the maximum mass for altitude and temperature at the landing aerodrome. Figure 18.1 shows 
a typical presentation of this data.
Discontinued Approach Instrument Climb.  (EU-OPS 1.510)
For instrument approaches with decision heights below 200 ft, an operator must verify that the 
approach mass of the aeroplane, taking into account the take-off mass and the fuel expected 
to be consumed in flight, allows a missed approach gradient of climb, with the critical engine 
failed and with the speed and configuration used for go-around of at least 2.5%, or the 
published gradient, whichever is the greater.

Class A - Landing
Landing Distance Requirements EU-OPS 1.515
The landing distance required on a dry runway for destination and alternate aerodromes, from 
50 ft to a full stop must not exceed:
•	 60% of the landing distance available for turbojet aeroplanes
•	 70% of the landing distance available for turboprop aeroplanes
(Short landing and steep approach procedures may be approved based on lower screen 
heights, but not less than 35 ft)
The landing distance required is based on:
•	 the aeroplane in the landing configuration
•	 the speed at 50 ft not less than 1.23VSR0 or VMCL
•	 aerodrome pressure altitude
•	 standard day temperature (ISA)
•	 factored winds (50% headwind, 150% tailwind)
•	 the runway slope if greater than ± 2%
VSR0 is the stall reference speed in the landing configuration.
VMCL, the minimum control speed during approach and landing with all engines operating, is 
the calibrated airspeed at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative, it is 
possible to maintain control of the aeroplane with that engine still inoperative, and maintain 
straight flight with an angle of bank of not more than 5° towards the live engine(s).
Runway Selection / Despatch Rules
Landing must be considered both in still air and in the forecast wind.
a.	
Still air:		
The most favourable runway in still air may be selected. 
b.	
Forecast wind:	The runway most likely to be used in the forecast wind. 
The lower of the two masses obtained from a. and b. above must be selected as the limiting 
mass for the field lengths available.
Non-compliance
•	 If the still air requirement cannot be met at an aerodrome with a single runway, that is, 
landing can only be made if there is an adequate wind component, the aircraft may be 
despatched if 2 alternate aerodromes are designated at which full compliance is possible.
•	 If the forecast wind requirement cannot be met, the aeroplane may be despatched if an 
alternate is designated at which all the landing requirements are met.
Wet Runways
If the runway is forecast to be wet at the estimated time of arrival, the landing distance available 
is at least 115% of the required landing distance.  However, a lesser factor may be used so long 
as it is published in the aeroplane flight manual and the authority has approved such a factor.

Explanations to Answers – Specimen Exam Paper
1.  	
The requirement for an aircraft to be certified in performance Class B is that the 
maximum certified take-off mass must not exceed 5700 kg AND the certified maximum 
number of passengers must not exceed 9.  If both these conditions are not met then 
the aircraft will be certified in Class A.
2.	
c.  As speed increases then the angle of attack and hence the thrust of the propeller 
decrease.
3.	
c.
4.	
b.  With a downhill slope the effort required to continue acceleration after VEF is less 
than the effort required to stop the aircraft because of the effect of gravity.  Hence 
take-off can be achieved from a lower speed, but stopping the aircraft within the 
distance available can only be achieved from a lower speed.
5.	
d.  The lowest take-off performance will occur when air density is at its lowest, hence 
high temperature and low pressure.
6.	
b.  see definitions.
7.	
c.  In determining take-off climb performance, the still air gradient is considered.
8.	
a.  As altitude increases the speed for best gradient of climb remains constant, but the 
speed for best rate of climb decreases until the two speeds coincide at the absolute 
ceiling.
9.	
d.  TODA is limited by the lower of TORA plus clearway and 1.5 × TORA.
10.	
a.  With a reduced flap setting the lift generated decreases and the stalling speed 
increases, so a greater take-off speed is required increasing the take-off distance. 
The reduced flap setting reduces the drag so the climb gradient increases.
11.	
c.  The use of reduced thrust means that the take-off distance will be increased and the 
climb gradient reduced, so neither of these can be limiting.
12.	
b.  Increasing the flap setting will reduce the TODR so the weight can be increased, but 
the climb gradient will reduce with the increased flap setting.
13.	
a.  see CAP 698 page 62, paragraph 2.5.1.
14.	
a.  Gradient of climb can be approximated to rate of climb divided by TAS.
15.	
c.  The decision to continue the take-off will be made, but because the speed is below 
the normal V1, the distance required to accelerate will be greater, so the TODA may 
well be exceeded.
16.	
c.  At a constant IAS drag will remain constant.
17.	
d.  The air density is greater at the lower aerodrome so the performance will be better 
in terms of acceleration and gradient.

18.	
c.  All speeds must be greater than VS.
19.	
b.  Although an uphill slope will enhance the deceleration, the effect on the acceleration 
to V1 will result in increased distances.
20.	
b.  Temperature is decreasing; therefore, the speed of sound and the TAS will decrease, 
and as altitude increases the IAS will also decrease.
21.	
c.  As speed increases, the induced drag reduces proportional to the square of the 
speed increase.
22.	
b.  As altitude increases at a given weight, the IAS for the onset of high speed buffet 
decreases and the IAS for the onset of low speed buffet remains constant, hence 
the speed range decreases.  As weight increases at a given altitude, the IAS for the 
onset of low speed buffet increases and there is a small decrease in the IAS for the 
onset of high speed buffet so once again the speed range decreases. 
23.	
a.  In the climb and descent an element of gravity acts along the aircraft axis either 
opposing (climb) or adding to (descent) the thrust, so only in level unaccelerated 
flight will the two forces be equal.
24.	
b. An increase in weight causes induced drag to increase and moves the total drag 
curve up and to the right. This will reduce the gradient and rate of climb and increase 
the speeds for VX and VY.
25.	
b.  As the C of G moves forward, the download on the tail increases, so the lift required 
also increases.  To create the extra lift either speed or angle of attack must increase. 
In either case, more thrust is required and the fuel required per NM will increase.
26.	
b.  The speed for maximum range in a jet aircraft is found where the line from the origin 
is tangential to the drag curve.  With a headwind the origin moves to the right by 
the amount of the wind component so the line from the origin will be tangential at 
a higher speed, and to the left with a tailwind giving a lower speed.
27.	
c.  V1 is the decision speed.  If engine failure is recognized below V1, take-off must be 
rejected, and if engine failure recognized above V1, take-off must be continued.
28.	
c.  The rate of descent is independent of the wind, but the descent path is modified 
by the wind, the angle increasing with a headwind because of the reduced ground 
distance covered.
29.	
b.  The maximum range speed is the speed at which the greatest distance can be flown, 
which means the lowest possible fuel usage.  To achieve this implies we must have 
the lowest specific fuel consumption.
30.	
c.  The most efficient way to operate a jet aircraft is to cruise climb, that is to set optimum 
cruise power and fly at the appropriate speed and allow the excess thrust as weight 
decreases to climb the aircraft.  For obvious safety reasons this is not possible, so the 
aircraft operates as close as possible to the optimum altitude by using the step climb 
technique.
31.	
c.  The absolute ceiling is the highest altitude to which the aircraft could be climbed, 
where, at optimum climb speed, thrust = drag, so with no excess of thrust the rate 
(and gradient) of climb will be zero.

32.	
c.  Net performance is gross (i.e. average) performance factored by a regulatory amount 
to give a ‘worst case’ view.  Therefore, the worst case for the climb gradient will be 
a lower gradient than it is expected to achieve.
33.	
d.  Gross take-off distance from the graph is 2500 ft.  There is no stopway or clearway 
so the factor to apply is 1.25 to get the minimum TOR. (see CAP 698, page 19)
34.	
d.  The maximum take-off mass will be achieved with the higher flap setting because 
the take-off speeds will be reduced.  As ever, take care when using the graphs.
35.	
c.  With a headwind component the glide performance will not be affected but the 
distance covered will reduce because of the reduced ground speed.
36.	
d.  The aircraft will be allowed to slow down to the optimum drift down speed before 
commencing descent which will take an amount of time dependent on weight and 
altitude.
37.	
d.  This is the EU-OPS regulatory requirement.
38.	
d.  Again the EU-OPS regulatory requirement.
39.	
c.  The EU-OPS regulatory requirement.
40.	
c.  With a reduced flap setting the stalling speed and hence the VREF will increase, so a 
greater landing distance will be required.  With a reduced flap setting the drag will 
decrease, so the climb gradient will be better.
