The Atmosphere
A Definition of Meteorology
“The branch of science dealing with the earth’s atmosphere and the physical processes 
occurring in it.”
Reasons for Studying Meteorology
•	 To understand the physical processes in the atmosphere
•	 To understand the meteorological hazards, their effect on aircraft and how to minimize the 
risks posed by those hazards
•	 To identify the weather information that is required for each flight
•	 To interpret actual and forecast weather conditions from the documentation provided
•	 To analyse and evaluate weather information before flight and in-flight
•	 To devise solutions to problems presented by weather conditions
Weather is the one factor in modern aviation over which man has no control; a knowledge 
of meteorology will at least enable the aviator to anticipate some of the difficulties which 
weather may cause.

For this course a knowledge of advanced physics is not required, but a knowledge of the 
elementary laws of motion, heating, cooling, condensation and evaporation will be useful.
A Definition of the Atmosphere
“The spheroidal gaseous envelope surrounding a heavenly body.”
The Constituents of the Atmosphere (By Volume) 
Nitrogen	
78.09%	 	
Argon	 	
	
0.93% 
Oxygen	
20.95%	
Carbon Dioxide	
0.03%
Plus traces of:
Neon	 	
Nitrous Oxide	 	
Helium		
Nitrogen Dioxide 
Krypton	
Carbon Monoxide	
Xenon	 	
Sulphur Dioxide 
Hydrogen	
Ammonia	
	
Methane	
Iodine and Ozone
Also present are solid particles and, in particular, water vapour which, from a meteorological 
point of view, is the most important gas in the atmosphere.
The proportions of the constituents remain constant up to a height of at least 60 km (except for 
ozone), but above this the mixing processes associated with the lower levels of the atmosphere 
no longer exist and gravitational separation of the gases occurs.  Although the trace of ozone 
in the atmosphere is important as a shield against ultraviolet radiation, if the whole of the layer 
of ozone were brought down to sea level it would only be 3 mm thick.
Properties of the Earth’s Atmosphere
The earth’s atmosphere varies vertically and horizontally in:

The Atmosphere
The Structure of the Atmosphere
•	 The Troposphere:
•	 is the lowest layer of the earth’s atmosphere where temperature decreases with an 
increase in height.
•	 consists of ¾ of the total atmosphere in weight.
•	 contains almost all the weather.
•	 The Stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere where temperature initially remains 
constant to an average height of 20 km then increases to reach a temperature of -2.5°C at 
a height of 47 km, then above 51 km temperature starts to decrease again.  The reason for 
the increase is the action of ultraviolet radiation in the formation of ozone.  The boundary 
between the stratosphere and the next layer, the mesosphere is known as the stratopause. 
The average height of the stratopause is 50 km in temperate latitudes.
•	 The Tropopause:
•	 This marks the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere and is where 
temperature ceases to fall with an increase in height. (Practically taken as the height 
where the temperature fall is less than 0.65°C per 100 m (2°C per 1000 ft.)
•	 The height of the tropopause is controlled by the temperature of the air near the 
surface. The warmer the air, the higher the tropopause. The colder the air, the lower 
the tropopause. Therefore, temperature variations due to latitude, season, land and 
sea, will all cause varying heights of the tropopause. There are two locations where the 
tropopause abruptly changes height or “folds”. These are at approximately 40° and 60° 
latitude. The average height of the tropopause at the Equator is 16-18 km with an average 
temperature of -75°C to -80°C, and at the poles 8 km with an average temperature of 
-40°C to -50°C.  The average value at 50°N is 11 km (36 090 ft) with a temperature of 
-56.5°C.
•	 The temperature of the tropopause is controlled by its height. The higher it is, the colder 
the temperature at the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the 
tropopause. The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40°C over the poles 
and as low as -80°C over the Equator.

The Significance of Tropopause Height
The significance of the tropopause height is that it usually marks:
•	 the maximum height of significant cloud.
•	 the presence of jet streams.
•	 the presence of Clear Air Turbulence (CAT). It is now referred to as TURB.
•	 the maximum wind speed.
•	 the upper limit of most of the weather
Temperatures
Temperature in the troposphere increases from the poles to the Equator.
Temperature in the lower stratosphere increases from the Equator to the poles in summer but 
reaches max temperature in mid latitudes in winter.
Atmospheric Hazards
As aircraft operating altitudes increase, so concentrations of OZONE and COSMIC RADIATION 
become of greater importance to the aviator.
Above 50 000 ft, normal concentrations of ozone exceed tolerable limits and air needs to be 
filtered before entering the cabin. The heat of the compressor system will assist in the breaking 
down of the ozone to an acceptable level.
Cosmic radiation is not normally hazardous, but at times of solar flare activity a lower flight 
level may be necessary.
Advances in meteorological forecasting and communications should result in pilots receiving 
prompt and accurate information regarding high altitude hazards, but it is important that they 
should be aware of these hazards and prepared to take the necessary re-planning action.
The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
Because temperature and pressure vary with time and position, both horizontally and vertically, 
it is necessary, in aviation, to have a standard set of conditions to give a common datum for:
•	 the calibration of aircraft pressure instruments
•	 the design and testing of aircraft.
The standard atmosphere now used in aviation is the ICAO International Standard Atmosphere 
(ISA).  ISA defines an ‘average’ atmosphere from -5 km (-16 400 ft) to 80 km (262 464 ft).  For 
practical purposes we just need to look at the ISA between mean sea level and 20 km.
The ICAO International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is:
•	 a MSL temperature of +15° Celsius,
•	 a MSL pressure of 1013.25 hectopascals (hPa),
•	 a MSL density of 1225 grams / cubic metre,
•	 a lapse rate of 0.65°C/100 m (1.98°C/1000 ft) up to 11 km (36 090 ft), 
•	 a constant temperature of -56.5°C up to 20 km (65 617 ft),
•	 an increase of temperature 0.1°C/100 m (0.3° C/1000 ft), up to 32 km (104 987 ft).
Note: Practically we use a lapse rate of 2°/1000 ft for calculations up to the Tropopause.

ISA Deviation
To determine true altitude and for the assessment of performance data it is necessary to 
determine the temperature deviation from the ISA at any specified altitude.  To do this we 
firstly need to determine what the ISA temperature is at a specified altitude, then calculate the 
deviation from the ISA.
The ISA temperature at a particular pressure altitude is found by reducing the MSL temperature 
by 2°C for each 1000 ft above 1013 hPa datum:
ISA Temperature = 15 - 2× altitude (in 1000 ft)
e.g. find the ISA temperature at 18 000 ft:
ISA temperature = 15 - 2 × 18 = -21°C
Note: Remember the temperature is isothermal above 36 000 ft (11 km) in the ISA at -57°C.
Now to find the deviation from ISA we subtract the ISA temperature from the actual 
temperature:
ISA Deviation = actual temperature  - ISA temperature
So if the actual temperature at 18 000 ft is -27°C, then the deviation is:
ISA Deviation = -27 - (-21) = -6°
For the temperatures below, calculate the ISA deviations:

If the limiting deviation for your aircraft at an airfield 5000 ft AMSL is ISA +10, what is the 
maximum temp at which you can operate?
If the deviation at 3500 ft is +12, what is the ambient temperature?

Note: The above height change figures show how the pressure against height change equation is 
modified as altitude changes but the figures offered only relate to ISA conditions of Temperature 
and Pressure. We can assess changes outside these conditions by using the following formula:
H = 96 ×T
P
where	 H = height change per hPa in feet
	
T = Actual Absolute Temperature at that level in kelvin (K)
	
P = Actual Pressure in hPa
	
Note: this formula is only valid for calculating the height change per hPa change in pressure at 
a specified altitude; it cannot be used to calculate a change in height between two pressure 
levels, nor the change in pressure between two altitudes.

Variations in pressure have long been associated with changes in the weather - the ‘falling 
glass’ usually indicating the approach of bad weather. The Handbook of Aviation Meteorology 
makes the statement:
“The study of atmospheric pressure may be said to form the foundations of the science of 
meteorology.”
Atmospheric Pressure
Atmospheric pressure is the force per unit area exerted by the atmosphere on any surface in 
contact with it. If pressure is considered as the weight of a column of air of unit cross-sectional 
area above a surface, then it can be seen from the diagram that the pressure (weight of the 
column above) at the upper surface will be less than that at the lower surface.
Thus atmospheric pressure will decrease with an increase in height.
Figure 2.1 The Weight of the Atmosphere on the Surface of the Earth
Units of Measurement 
The standard unit of force is the NEWTON (N) and an average for atmospheric pressure at sea 
level is 101 325 newtons per square metre (pascals).  For simplicity this is expressed as 1013.25 
hectopascals (hPa) because the earlier system of measurement was millibars (mb) and 1 hPa = 
1 mb.  In some countries millibars are still used.  Other units which are still in use are related to 
the height of a column of mercury in a barometer in inches or millimetres (see overleaf).
Note: mean sea level pressure in the ISA is 29.92 inches or 760 mm of mercury.

Mercury Barometer 
The basic instrument used for the measurement of atmospheric pressure is the mercury 
barometer. The atmospheric pressure is measured by the height of a column of mercury, and 
this height can be read in terms of any of the units shown above. The USA still uses inches of 
mercury as their measurement of atmospheric pressure.
Figure 2.2 A Mercury Barometer
Aneroid Barometer.
A more compact means of measuring atmospheric pressure is the Aneroid Barometer. It 
consists of partially evacuated capsules, which respond to changes in pressure by expanding 
and contracting, and a system of levers, these changes of pressure being indicated by a pointer 
moving over a scale.

The Barograph
To enable a continuous record of pressure changes to be made, a paper covered rotating drum 
is substituted for the scale and the instrument then becomes a barograph. This instrument is 
used by the meteorologist to measure what is known as pressure tendency, the rise and fall of 
pressure over a period of time. Pressure tendency is an important forecasting tool.

Variations of Pressure
Height 
With an increase in height, the weight of air overlying the surface will reduce. Therefore 
pressure will fall with height. The rate of change of pressure with height (the barometric lapse 
rate) reduces as altitude increase (see table on page 9), or the height change per hPa 
increases as altitude increases
However, temperature has a dramatic effect on the pressure change with height, i.e. the 
pressure lapse rate. Warm air will cause pressure to fall slowly with height, i.e. decreasing 
the pressure lapse rate, whereas cold air will cause pressure to fall rapidly with height, i.e. 
increasing the pressure lapse rate. Therefore we would expect the pressure at any given height 
to be higher over warm air and lower over cold air. The effect of temperature on the rate of 
change of pressure with height is an important fact which we will return to in altimetry and 
upper winds.
Shown below is how temperature affects the height difference with a 1 hPa change in pressure. 
These values have been derived from the formula described in the chapter on the atmosphere.

Diurnal Variation 
There is a change in pressure during the day which although small (about 1 hPa in temperate 
latitudes, can be as much as 3 hPa in the tropics) would need to be taken into account when 
considering pressure tendency as an indication of changing weather. The variation is shown in 
Figure 2.6.
Figure 2.6 Diurnal Variation
The variation is difficult to explain, but is probably due to a natural oscillation of the atmosphere 
having a period of about 12 hours, this oscillation being maintained by the 24 hour variation 
of temperature.

Types of Pressure
QFE
The atmospheric pressure measured at the aerodrome reference point.  With QFE set on the 
altimeter the altimeter will read zero feet when the aircraft is on the aerodrome.
Figure 2.7 QFE
QNH
This is the barometric pressure at the airfield (QFE), converted to mean sea level (MSL) using 
the ISA temperature at the airfield and the ISA pressure lapse rate. This will provide a pressure 
which does not account for any temperature deviation away from ISA.  The correction to be 
made to the surface pressure will depend solely upon the height of the airfield AMSL. QNH is 
always a whole number without any decimal places and is always rounded down.  When on the 
aerodrome with QNH set the altimeter will read aerodrome elevation.
QFF 
Because temperature affects the change of pressure over height QNH is not a true mean sea 
level pressure (unless ISA conditions exist).  The forecaster needs to know the true mean sea 
level pressure in order to construct accurate analysis charts and to help with the forecasting of 
future changes.
The meteorological offices, therefore, convert QFE to MSL using the actual temperature and 
assuming isothermal conditions between the aerodrome and MSL.  This pressure is known 
as QFF and, because of the differential rate of change of pressure over height at different 
temperatures, may differ from QNH.
We can determine, from the formula above, that at temperatures below ISA we have a relatively 
small height change per 1 hPa change in pressure and a relatively large change at temperatures 
above ISA.

Example 1:  What is the relationship between QFF and QNH at Oxford (270 ft AMSL) if the 
QNH is 1020 hPa and the temperature ISA +10°? 
Figure 2.8 
 
The QNH is calculated using the ISA temperature and the QFF using the actual temperature. 
Since the actual temperature is warmer than ISA the change in pressure over 270 ft will be 
greater in the ISA than in the actual conditions.  As we are above MSL this means that the QNH 
will be greater than the QFF.
Example 2:  What is the relationship between QFF and QNH at an aerodrome 69 m below MSL 
if the QNH is 1005 hPa and the temperature is ISA-10°?  
Figure 2.9 
This time the change in pressure is greater for the calculation of QFF than for the QNH.  As we 
are reducing pressure this time it means the QNH will  once again be greater than the QFF.
We can use similar arguments to show that at an aerodrome AMSL with a temperature colder 
than ISA or at an aerodrome below MSL with a temperature greater than ISA the QFF will be 
greater than the QNH. This is summarized overleaf:

The normal range of mean sea level pressure (QFF) extends from 950 to 1050 hPa.  The lowest 
recorded mean sea level pressure is 870 hPa in the eye of Typhoon Tip in the Western Pacific 
in 1979.  The lowest recorded in the North Atlantic is 882 hPa in the eye of Hurricane Wilma in 
2005.  The highest mean sea level pressure was 1085.7 hPa recorded in winter in Siberia in 2001.

Density
Introduction
Density may be defined as mass per unit volume and may be expressed as:
•	 Grams per cubic metre.
•	 A percentage of the standard surface density - relative density.
•	 The altitude in the standard atmosphere to which the observed density corresponds - 
density altitude.
Effect of Changes of Pressure on Density
As pressure is increased, the air will be compressed which reduces the volume and increases the 
density. Likewise, if pressure is decreased, the air will expand which will increase the volume 
and decrease the density.
 (rho) = density
We can therefore say that:
DENSITY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO PRESSURE.
In the atmosphere density can be decreased by raising the volume of air to a greater height 
since we know that pressure decreases with an increase in altitude. Similarly, density can be 
increased by lowering the volume of air to a lower height.
Effect of Change of Temperature on Density
If a volume of air is heated it will expand and the mass of air contained in unit volume will be 
less. Thus density will decrease with an increase in temperature and we can say:
DENSITY IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO TEMPERATURE.
Effect of Changes in Humidity on Density
The molecular mass of water is less than that of nitrogen and oxygen.  If we increase the 
amount of water vapour in a fixed volume of air, then we are replacing the heavier nitrogen 
and oxygen molecules with the lighter water molecules so the total mass of that volume will 
decrease and hence the density will decrease.
DENSITY IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO WATER VAPOUR CONTENT

Density
Effect of Change of Altitude on Density
In the troposphere as altitude increases both temperature and pressure decrease but, although 
they have opposite effects on density, the effect of pressure is much greater than the effect of 
temperature so density decreases as altitude increases.
(In the ISA ρ = 100% at sea level, 50% at 20 000 ft, 25% at 40 000 ft and 10% at 60 000 ft)
Density will change by 1% for a 3 degree change in temperature or a 10 hPa change in pressure.
Effect of Change of Latitude on Density
At the surface as latitude increases temperature decreases so density will increase as we move 
from the Equator towards the poles. At the Equator the surface temperatures are high so 
the rate of change of pressure with height is relatively low compared to the poles where 
temperatures are low and the change of pressure with height is relatively high.  This means 
that at, say, 50 000 ft the pressure over the Equator will be relatively high compared to the 
pressure at 50 000 ft over the poles.  The temperatures are lower at 50 000 ft at the Equator 
than at the poles which means that the density at 50 000 ft at the poles will be less than at 
50 000 ft at the Equator. So we can summarize the change of density as follows:
•	 at the surface density increases as latitude increases
•	 at about 26 000 ft density remains constant with an increase in latitude.
•	 above 26 000 ft density decreases with an increase in latitude. (Maximum deviation from 
standard occurs at about 50 000 ft.)

Pressure Systems
Introduction
Isobars can form patterns, which when they are recognized, can help us forecast the weather. 
These patterns are called pressure distribution systems. They include:
•	 Depressions, or lows.
•	 Anticyclones, or highs.
•	 Troughs.
•	 Ridges.
•	 Cols.
Buys Ballot’s Law
In the 19th century the Dutch scientist and meteorologist, Buys Ballot, produced a law based 
on the observation of wind direction and pressure systems.
Buys Ballot’s Law states that:
If an observer stands with his back to the wind in the Northern Hemisphere then the low 
pressure is on his left.  (In the Southern Hemisphere low pressure is to the right.)
This law will prove to be a useful tool in both the study of wind and altimetry.
Advection
Advection is a meteorological term for horizontal movement of air.
Depressions
A depression is a region of comparatively low pressure shown by more or less circular and 
concentric isobars surrounding the centre, where pressure is lowest. A depression is sometimes 
called a low or a cyclone.  In Europe the term cyclone is usually reserved for tropical revolving 
storms.  However, the term cyclonic circulation implies a low pressure system.
Buys Ballots’ law tells us that the wind will move around a low pressure system in an anti-
clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere.

Figure 4.1 A Depression in the Northern Hemisphere
There are two types of depression, frontal (large scale) found in our temperate latitudes and 
non-frontal (small scale) depressions which can occur virtually anywhere.
In a depression air is converging at the surface, rising from the surface to medium to high 
altitude (convection) then diverging at medium to high altitude.

               Pressure Systems

Pressure Systems
Frontal depressions are known as Polar Front Depressions and form, in temperate latitudes, 
in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres when warm, moist sub-tropical air masses 
meet cold polar air masses. These depressions move from west to east and eventually, in the 
Northern Hemisphere, lose their identity over the North American or Eurasian land masses. In 
the N. Atlantic these depressions originate in the central to western Atlantic and move rapidly 
eastward, eventually losing their identity over the steppes of central Asia.  An example of a 
polar front depression is centred over Greenland/Iceland on the analysis chart on the next 
page.
Non-frontal depressions are usually formed by surface heating when they are known as thermal 
depressions. They occur over land in summer as a result of strong surface heating. They also 
occur over the warm sub-tropical oceans where they are known as tropical cyclones. In winter 
they occur over sea areas in cold polar or arctic air masses. The different types of depressions 
and their formation will be discussed in later chapters.  On the analysis chart thermal depressions 
(labelled TD) are seen over the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, formed in the cold air 
coming out of central Asia
Figure 4.3 
Troughs
A trough is an extension of a low pressure system.  On the analysis chart there are two troughs 
associated with the polar front depression centred over Greenland/Iceland.  One extending 
north across Greenland is a non-frontal trough.  The other extending southward is a frontal 
trough formed along the cold front.  Troughs are very often associated with the fronts of polar 
front depressions.  The weather associated with a trough will be similar to that of a depression.

Cloud	 	
extensive and may extend from low altitude to the tropopause
Precipitation	 may be continuous/intermittent precipitation or showers and intensity can 
range from light to heavy dependent on the type of depression
Visibility	
Poor in precipitation, otherwise good due to ascending air.
Temperature	 dependent on type of depression and time of year.  For example, a frontal 
depression coming into Europe from the Atlantic in winter will bring warmer air, 
but in summer will bring cooler air.
Winds	 	
Winds are usually strong - the deeper the depression and the closer the isobars, 
the stronger the wind.
Anticyclones
An anticyclone or high is a region of relatively high pressure shown by more or less circular 
isobars similar to a depression but with higher pressure at the centre.
Figure 4.4 An Anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere
Isobars are more widely spaced than with depressions. There are five types of anticyclone, 
warm, cold, temporary cold, ridges (or wedges) and blocking.  Within an anticyclone, at high 
altitude we have air converging, then descent of air within the anticyclone (subsidence) and 
divergence at the surface.

Pressure Systems
Figure 4.5 Vertical Cross-section
Cold anticyclones occur as permanent features at the poles and as seasonal features over 
continental land masses in the winter.  In simple terms the air at the surface is cooled thereby 
increasing its density and drawing more air down from above hence increasing the surface 
pressure.
Warm Anticyclones
To  understand  the   formation 
of warm anticyclones we 
need to look at the global 
circulation of air.  In the 19th 
century a British scientist, 
George Hadley, proposed a 
global circulation based on 
hot air rising at the Equator 
then flowing up to the 
poles at the tropopause, 
descending at the poles and 
flowing back to the Equator 
at the surface.  This model 
was not quite correct because 
in our temperate latitudes 
pressure 
is 
predominantly 
low because of the large 
scale frontal depressions.  An 
American scientist, William Ferrel, proposed a modification to Hadley’s model introducing the 
Figure 4.6 Hadley Cell, Polar Front, and Associated Wind-Flows.
--- Page 50 ---

Pressure Systems
modification arising because of the low pressure systems in temperate latitudes.  This gives 
the three circulation cells, the Hadley cell between the Equator and the subtropics, the Ferrel 
cell between the subtropics and temperate latitudes and the Polar cell between temperate 
latitudes and the poles.
This circulation means that we have, at the tropopause, air flowing outwards from the Equator 
towards the poles and from temperate latitudes towards the Equator.  This creates an excess 
of air at the tropopause in subtropical regions which is forced to descend, hence creating the 
subtropical high pressure systems which are permanent features over the subtropical oceans, 
for example the Azores high in the N. Atlantic.
Ridges
Ridges of high pressure are indicated by isobars 
extending outwards from an anticyclone and 
always rounded, never V-shaped as seen in a 
trough. 
Temporary Cold Anticyclones
A temporary cold anticyclone is a ridge of high 
pressure found in the cold air between two 
frontal depressions.  Because the depressions 
are moving rapidly the influence of these 
anticyclones will be experienced for up to a 
maximum of about 24 hours.

Blocking Anticyclones
A blocking anticyclone is one which prevents the usual eastward movement of frontal 
depressions, forcing these depressions to take up northerly tracks in the Northern Hemisphere. 
These anticyclones are usually extensions of the warm subtropical anticyclones.  They can 
persist for weeks giving (usually) warm dry weather in summer and gloomy overcast conditions 
in winter with a possibility of drizzle.  Over Europe in winter they may be extensions of the 
Siberian high giving (usually) cold clear conditions.

Cols
Cols are regions of almost level pressure 
between two highs and two lows. It is an area 
of stagnation as illustrated in Figure 4.10 and 
Figure 4.11.
Col Weather
Col weather is normally settled, but is 
dependent on changing pressure.
In 
autumn 
and 
winter 
cols 
produce 
poor visibility and fog, whilst in summer 
thunderstorms are common. Figure 4.11 is an 
example of a weather forecast for a day when 
a col influenced the weather over the UK.

Pressure Systems Movement
Frontal depressions tend to move rapidly. The movement of non-frontal depressions depends on 
type and location; they may remain relatively static or move at moderate speeds.  Anticyclones 
tend to be slow moving and will persist in more or less the same location for long periods.  Cols 
tend to be static.
Movement of the systems is the key to accurate forecasting.
The figures below show the movement of weather over a period of four successive days.

Terminology
Depressions will fill up or decay as pressure rises.
Depressions will deepen as pressure falls.
Frontal depressions move rapidly, their average lifetime is 10 to 14 days.
Anticyclones will build up as pressure rises.
Anticyclones will weaken or collapse as pressure falls.
Anticyclones are generally slow moving and may persist for long periods.
Cols may last up to a few days before being replaced by other pressure systems.

Temperature
Introduction
One of the important variables in the atmosphere is temperature. The study of temperature 
variation, both horizontally and vertically has considerable significance in the study of 
meteorology.
Measurement
There are three scales which may be used to measure temperature though only Celsius and 
Kelvin are used in meteorology. The figures show the melting point of ice and the boiling point 
of water (at standard pressure) in each scale.
•	 The FAHRENHEIT scale: +32 and +212 degrees.
•	 The CELSIUS (or Centigrade) scale: 0 and +100 degrees.
•	 The KELVIN (or Absolute) scale: +273 and +373 Kelvin. 
Conversion factors:
°C = 5
9  × (°F - 32)
°F = 
9
5  × °C + 32
K = °C + 273
Instruments
The standard means of measurement on the 
ground is a mercury thermometer placed 
in a Stevenson Screen. Electrical resistance 
thermometers may be used where the screen is 
not readily accessible to the observer.
Figure 5.1 The Stevenson Screen

Temperature
A Thermograph (similar in its output to a barograph) will also be found inside the screen. The 
Stevenson screen is a louvred box 4 feet (1.22 m) above the ground. This screen, shown in 
Figure 5.1, is used worldwide.
Figure 5.2 Thermograph
Upper air temperature (and pressure and humidity) are measured using a Radiosonde, shown 
in Figure 5.3, - a device transmitting continuous readings whilst being carried aloft beneath a 
balloon. Rate of climb is 1200 fpm and maximum ceiling between 65 000 and 115 000 ft.  Earlier 
devices were tracked using radar to determine position and to determine wind speed.  Modern 
systems use GPS to provide a 3D position to send with the data.
Figure 5.3 A Radiosonde
Aircraft readings, though often the only way in which atmospheric temperature may be 
measured over the oceans and other areas far away from meteorological stations, are not as 
accurate as they are affected by compressibility and lag. The electrical thermometer will give 
a digital readout of temperature and this can be automatically calibrated and transmitted on 
some modern aircraft.

Heating of the Troposphere
The main source of heat for the troposphere is the sun.
•	 Solar Radiation. Radiation from the sun is of Short wave-length (λ) and passes through the 
troposphere almost without heating it at all.
λ = 0.15 - 4 microns (micron = µ = 10 -6 m)
Some solar radiation is reflected back to the upper air from cloud tops and from water 
surfaces on the earth. The rest of this radiation heats the earth’s surface. The process 
whereby the surface is heated by solar radiation is called insolation.
Figure 5.5 Solar Radiation
--- Page 66 ---

Temperature
There are four processes which heat the troposphere:
•	 Terrestrial Radiation.
The earth radiates heat at all times. It is relatively long wave radiation λ = 4 to 80 microns, 
peaking at 10 m.
This radiation is absorbed by the so-called greenhouse gases giving rise to the lapse rate in 
the troposphere, principally water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane. The increase in the 
amount of carbon dioxide in the troposphere is one of the factors contributing to global 
warming. (Note: the global warming phenomenon is much more complex than this.)
Figure 5.6 Terrestrial Radiation
•	 Conduction. Air lying in contact with the earth’s surface by day will be heated by conduction. 
At night air in contact with the earth’s surface will be cooled by conduction. Because of the 
air’s poor conductivity, the air at a higher level will remain at the same temperature as 
during the day and an inversion will result.
Figure 5.7 Conduction

Temperature
•	 Convection. Air heated by conduction will be less dense and will therefore rise. This will 
produce up currents called thermals or convection currents. These will take the warm air 
to higher levels in the troposphere. This and terrestrial radiation are the two main processes 
heating the troposphere.
Figure 5.8 Convection Currents
•	 Condensation. As the air is lifted it will cool by the adiabatic process and the water vapour 
in the air will condense out as visible droplets forming cloud. As this occurs latent heat will 
be released by the water vapour and this will add to the heating of the troposphere.

Figure 5.10 Heat Processes in the Atmosphere
Temperature Variation with Height
We have seen that although our source of heat 
is the sun, because of the troposphere’s virtual 
transparency to insolation, it is in fact heated 
(by long wave IR) from the surface upwards.
Thus as we move further and further from the 
surface we would expect the heating effects to 
diminish.
Lapse Rate
The rate at which temperature falls with an 
increase in height is called the Lapse Rate. 
An ideal uniform atmosphere would show a 
constant lapse rate rather like the ISA, which is 
0.65°C/100 m (1.98°C (2°) per 1000 ft.)
Isotherm
If temperature remains constant with height it is called an isothermal layer.

Temperature
Inversions
Where the temperature increases with an increase in height, then we have what is called an 
inversion. We have already seen that at night we can expect an inversion above the surface, 
but this can occur in many different ways.
Radiation, on a night of clear skies, will also result in a temperature inversion above the surface. 
This is called a Radiation Inversion.
When we look at cloud formation, we shall see that because of turbulence in the layer closest 
to the surface we can have an inversion at a height of 2 or 3 thousand feet.
Quite often, at the tropopause instead of the temperature remaining constant, it may show a 
slight rise for a few thousand feet.
At the higher levels of the stratosphere, temperature will show an increase with height  (in ISA 
from 20 km to 32 km the temperature increases at 1°C per km).
In a high pressure system, air descends at the centre. As the air descends it will be heated 
adiabatically (more of this later) and will be warmer than the air at a lower level. This is called 
a Subsidence Inversion.

Surface Temperature
The surface air temperature measured in a Stevenson screen is subject to considerable variations: 
Latitude Effect, Seasonal Effect, Diurnal Variation and multiple effects due to cloud and wind.
The Angular Elevation of the Sun
•	 Latitude Effect. At the Equator only a small area is heated by the sun’s radiation and 
therefore will be subject to the greatest heat/unit area. At the poles the sun’s rays will cover 
a larger area and there will be the least heat/unit area.
•	 The actual distance of polar regions from 
the sun is only fractionally more than that 
from the Equator, and the effect may be 
ignored.
•	 Seasonal Effect. The Vernal (Spring) and 
autumnal equinoxes occur about 21 March 
and 21 September respectively.  Then 
the sun is directly over the Equator and 
maximum heating will occur there.  About 
21 June the sun reaches its most northerly 
latitude (Summer Solstice for the Northern 
Hemisphere) and maximum heating will 
occur in the Northern Hemisphere.  But the 
land (and sea) continues to heat up and 
maximum temperatures are found around 
late July or early August in temperate 
latitudes.  Around 21 December the sun 
reaches its most southerly latitude (Winter 
Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere) and 
minimum heating occurs.  But the land 
(and sea) continues to cool down and 
minimum temperatures are experienced 
around late January or early February in 
temperate latitudes.
Diurnal Variation - (Note: This Assumes Clear Skies and Light Winds and No Change 
in Air Mass)
•	 The sun is at its highest elevation at noon, but for two to three hours after this time, the 
earth is receiving more solar radiation than it is giving up as terrestrial radiation. A balance 
between incoming and outgoing radiation is reached on average at 1500 local time when 
maximum temperatures can be expected.
Note: the actual time of maximum temperature varies with latitude and time of year, earlier 
in winter later in summer, but 1500 local time is a good average for temperate latitudes.

Temperature
•	 From 15:00 onwards, the temperature falls continuously until a little after sunrise. The 
lowest temperature occurs at about sunrise plus 30 minutes when once again we get a 
balance between incoming and outgoing radiation.
•	 Diurnal Variation (DV) is greatest with clear skies and little wind.  DV varies with a number 
of factors, but in temperate latitudes is about +/- 6 degrees about the mean.
Figure 5.15 Diurnal Variation
•	 Cloud cover by day. By day some of the solar radiation is reflected back by the cloud tops 
and maximum temperature (T Max) is reduced. 
Figure 5.16 Cloud Cover by Day
--- Page 72 ---
Temperature

Temperature
•	 Cloud cover by night. By night terrestrial radiation is absorbed and radiated back to the 
earth’s surface from the clouds. T min is increased.
Figure 5.17 Cloud Cover by Night
•	 Effect of wind by day. By day wind will cause turbulent mixing of the warm air at the 
surface with cold air above, reducing T max. Wind will also reduce the time the air is in 
contact with the warm ground.
Figure 5.18 The Effect of Wind by Day

                                    Temperature

Temperature
•	 Effect of wind by night. By night there will normally be an inversion above the surface and 
wind will cause cold air to be turbulently mixed with warm air above thus increasing T min.
Figure 5.19 The Effect of Wind by Night
In summary, wind or cloud cover will cause T max to be reduced and T min to be increased. 
Therefore DV will be reduced.
•	 DV over sea. As the Specific Heat (SH) of water is unity, compared to other substances 
whose SH is much less, and as the temperature rise is inversely proportional to the Specific 
Heat, the diurnal temperature variation over the sea is small, generally less than 1°C.
Nature of the Surface
•	 Sea. The sea takes a long time to heat (and cool) and as we have seen has a very small DV.
Figure 5.20 Diurnal Variation Over the Sea
--- Page 74 ---
Temperature

Temperature
The difference in DV values between land and sea is the cause of sea breezes. The minimal 
DV of sea temperature is the reason why the most common form of fog, radiation fog, 
never forms over the sea.
When the angular elevation of the sun is low, much solar radiation is reflected back to the 
atmosphere.
•	 Land. Bare rock, sand, dry soil, tarred roads and concrete runways attain a higher temperature 
by insolation than woods, lakes, grasslands and wet soil.
The temperature difference between air above concrete runways and adjacent grass can 
be as much as 4 degrees. Higher temperature surfaces provide strong up currents called 
thermals or convection currents.

Temperature
In Figure 5.21 we may note that the sea temperature remains “cool” in July in the Northern 
Hemisphere but the desert land areas of Africa and neighbouring Asia get very warm. Air 
over snow covered surfaces is very cold.	
Some 80% of solar radiation is reflected from 
snow surfaces.
Snow does not prevent the earth from radiating its heat. Hence surface air temperatures 
over snow will become colder day by day. Temperatures in Siberia can reach -72°C after a long 
cold winter. This very cold air results in high density and the development of anticyclones.
Location
•	 Over Land. Air in a valley will tend to be more static than air in an exposed position. Therefore 
by night the air is in contact with the ground for a longer time and the air temperature is 
lower than on a hill. Additionally, in a valley, cold air tends to sink from the hills above at 
night, again causing lower temperatures. It is for these reasons that mist and fog tend to 
form firstly in valleys.
Figure 5.22 Location Effect
•	 Over Oceans. The fact that seas tend to have a very small DV of temperature has been 
stated above. On a wide scale this means that in winter the sea is warmer than the land and 
thus there is a widespread movement of air from land to sea (monsoon effect). There is an 
opposite tendency in summer.

Origin of Air Supply 
Air tends to retain its temperature and humidity for a considerable time, therefore air from 
high latitudes will bring lower temperatures to UK. A southerly wind, however, will normally 
provide an increase in temperature.

Humidity
Definition of Latent Heat
The latent heat of a substance is the heat absorbed or released without change of temperature 
when the substance changes state. Latent heat differs according to the state of the substance. 
When ice changes to water or water vapour, or water changes to water vapour, latent heat is 
absorbed.
When water vapour changes to water or ice, or water changes to ice, latent heat is released.
Evaporation 
Evaporation is the change of state from liquid to vapour. Latent heat is absorbed.
Evaporation can occur at any temperature. For a particular temperature there is a particular 
amount of water per unit volume that the air can hold. When this maximum is reached, 
evaporation will cease.
Figure 6.1 The Change of State from Solid to Liquid to Gas and Back Again.
Saturation
Air becomes saturated by adding more water vapour to it. Alternatively, as warm air can hold 
more water vapour than cold, saturation can be achieved by cooling the air.
Air is saturated if it contains the maximum amount of water vapour that it can hold at that 
temperature. If saturated air is cooled, condensation will occur.
Condensation
Condensation is the change of state from vapour to liquid.  Latent heat is released. 
Condensation causes cloud and fog to form.  Condensation will require minute impurities or 
particles called hygroscopic or condensation nuclei; these are usually present in abundance in 
the troposphere.

Humidity
Freezing
If the water droplet is cooled below zero, then it may change state again to ice. The process 
is called freezing.  Freezing requires the presence of freezing nuclei; these are less common 
in the troposphere than condensation nuclei, so it is possible to have water droplets in the 
atmosphere with temperatures below 0°C.  These are known as supercooled water droplets 
and give us the icing hazard discussed in Chapter 16. 
Melting
The opposite change of state, from solid to liquid, is called melting. (There is no superfrozen 
state).
Sublimation
Sublimation is the change of state directly from water vapour to ice without water droplets 
being formed. Latent heat is released. This process is also known as deposition.
The change of state from ice directly to water vapour is also called sublimation.
Humidity Measurement
•	 Absolute Humidity is the weight of water vapour in unit volume of air. Absolute Humidity 
is usually expressed in g/m3 .
•	 Humidity Mixing Ratio (HMR) is the weight of water vapour contained in unit mass of dry 
air. The Humidity Mixing Ratio is usually expressed in g/kg. In unsaturated air, HMR remains 
constant during ascent while temperature and pressure decreases.
•	 Saturation Mixing Ratio (SMR) is the maximum amount of water vapour a unit mass of dry 
air can hold at a specified temperature.
•	 Relative Humidity (RH).
The ratio	
HMR
SMR × 100%
or more simply, the amount of water vapour present in a volume of air divided by the 
maximum amount of water vapour which that volume could hold at that temperature 
expressed as a percentage.
RH 100% = SATURATION

Figure 6.2 The Amount of Water Vapour the Air can Hold when Saturated at Different Temperatures
Bergeron Theory
This is more accurately the (Wegener)-Bergeron-Findeissen theory, named after the 3 scientists 
who discovered the relationship. Figure 6.3, next page, shows the partial pressure of water 
vapour at saturation for temperatures from -30°C to +40°C.  As we already know, the maximum 
amount of water vapour the air can hold and hence the partial water vapour pressure at 
saturation decreases as temperature decreases.
The small sub-diagram shows that at temperatures below 0°C the partial pressure at saturation 
for the formation of water is greater than the partial pressure for the formation of ice.  This 
means that the air becomes saturated for the formation of ice before it becomes saturated 
for the formation of water.  In other words at temperatures below zero the water vapour will 
go directly to the solid state without first going through the liquid state (the converse also 
applies).  This may be stated as: “the saturation vapour pressure over water is greater than 
over ice”.

Figure 6.3 
The table shows the same effect in terms of relative humidity for water and ice, for example, at 
-10°C when the air is saturated for the formation of ice the relative humidity for water is 91%. 
The effect of this is that when supercooled water droplets exist (at temperatures below 0°C), 
the water droplets will evaporate saturating the air (for the formation of ice) and the water 
vapour will now sublime out as ice.  This effect is important in the formation of precipitation in 
clouds when the temperature is below 0°C and in the formation of fog.

Measurement of Humidity
Atmospheric humidity is measured using a dry bulb and wet bulb hygrometer or psychrometer 
or an electrical hygrometer. The dry bulb and wet bulb hygrometer or psychrometer comprises 
two thermometers.  The dry bulb thermometer gives the ambient temperature.  The wet bulb 
thermometer has, around its bulb, a muslin cloth the other end of which is in a reservoir of 
distilled water.  The water rises up the muslin and evaporates drawing heat from the bulb and 
hence reducing its temperature.  So the wet bulb thermometer gives the lowest temperature to 
which the air can be cooled by the evaporation of water.  The rate at which the water evaporates 
depends on the relative humidity.  With high relative humidity the rate of evaporation will 
be slow so the wet bulb temperature will be relatively high.  Conversely if the air is dry the 
evaporation will be rapid and the wet bulb temperature will be much lower than the dry bulb 
temperature.
Dry-bulb and Wet-bulb Hygrometer or Psychrometer
•	 If air is dry, water will evaporate from the muslin covering the wet bulb and latent heat will 
lower the temperature.
•	 If air is saturated, no evaporation will occur and thermometers will read the same.
•	 Dew point, relative humidity and HMR are read from tables or slide rule by entering with 
the two temperatures obtained.
Figure 6.4 Dry-Bulb and Wet-Bulb Hygrometer or Psychrometer
Dew Point Temperature
Dew point (DP) is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for 
saturation to occur.
Note that the dew point temperature is not the same as the wet bulb temperature 
(except at saturation).
The dew point has a lapse rate of 0.5°C/1000 ft
Wet bulb  = dry bulb (= dew point) – 100% RH (saturation)

Diurnal Variation of Humidity
By day, as the temperature increases, RH will decrease because the maximum amount of water 
vapour air can hold increases as the temperature rises.
After 1500 hrs, the temperature will start to fall and the maximum amount of water vapour the 
air can hold will fall and thus the RH will increase. The higher RH at night is the reason for the 
formation of mist and fog after dark in autumn and winter.
Figure 6.5 Diurnal Variation of Humidity
RH is maximum approximately 30 minutes after sunrise when the temperature is minimum.
Figure 6.6 shows a graph of relative humidity at RAF Waddington over a number of years. The 
maximum and minimum times and the sinusoidal curve confirm Figure 6.5.

By definition:
Saturated Air: RH=100% 
Dry Air: RH<100%

Adiabatics and Stability
Adiabatic Temperature Changes
An adiabatic temperature change occurs 
when a gas is compressed or expanded with 
no external exchange of heat.
We can experience this in everyday life.  When 
we use a manual pump to inflate a bicycle 
tyre we observe that the tyre valve gets hot. 
The reason for this is that the compression of 
the air in the pump raises its temperature and 
this heat is transferred to the valve as the air 
passes through.
The opposite effect is observed when a carbon 
dioxide (CO2) fire extinguisher is discharged. 
The CO2 is under very high pressure in the 
cylinder, when the release handle is operated the gas expands rapidly as it exits the cylinder 
cooling as it does so.  (In fact the expansion is so great that the fall in temperature is such that 
we risk frost burns if we hold the horn.)
In each case the temperature has changed because of the expansion or compression of the gas; 
no heat has been added from or removed to external sources.
In the atmosphere pressure decreases as altitude increases so if a parcel of air is forced to rise 
it will expand as it rises and hence will cool by the adiabatic process.  Similarly if a parcel of 
air is forced to descend it will become compressed and hence heat up, again by the adiabatic 
process.
The Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate - DALR
The Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR) is the lapse rate for rising dry (i.e. unsaturated) air.  It has 
a constant value of 1°C/100 m (about 3°C/1000 ft) as illustrated in Figure 7.2.
The Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate - SALR
Saturated air, when forced to rise will also cool, but as it cools condensation will take place, 
releasing latent heat which slows the rate at which the air cools.  The Saturated Adiabatic Lapse 
Rate (SALR) is the lapse rate for rising air which is saturated (RH 100%) and has an average value 
in temperate latitudes near the ground of 0.6°C/100 m (1.8°C/1000 ft), as seen in Figure 7.3.

Adiabatics and Stability
Variation of the SALR with Temperature
The amount of water vapour the air can hold is directly proportional to temperature. At high 
temperatures the air can hold large amounts of water vapour so that when it cools a much 
greater amount condenses releasing a lot of latent heat thus slowing the cooling process even 
more. Conversely, at low temperature the air holds a relatively small amount of water vapour, 
so little latent heat is released to slow the rate of cooling.
Hence the SALR increases as latitude and/or altitude increase, tending towards DALR at high 
altitude and high latitude.
The difference between DALR and SALR is shown in Figure 7.4.
A comparison between SALRs at different latitudes is shown below.

The Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR)
The ELR is the actual temperature profile of the troposphere 
as measured by radiosonde ascents. It varies with time and 
position.
Stability
Stability can be defined as being resistance to change.  When dealing with atmospheric stability 
we are looking at what happens to air in vertical motion.  If a parcel of air is forced to rise, for 
example over a mountain, when it gets to the top of the mountain there are 3 things it can do. 
It may return to its original height, it may continue rising or it may remain at the height of the 
summit.  In the first case, in terms of the vertical position, the air is where it started so before 
and after are the same so we have a stable situation.  In the second case we have continual 
change and hence instability.  The third situation is a neutral or indifferent case, since the 
parcel of air is remaining where it was moved.
Atmospheric stability is determined by comparing the ELR with the DALR and the SALR.

Let us imagine a hill, 300 m high.  A radiosonde ascent gives the ELR over the first few hundred 
metres as 1.2°C/100 m so the environmental temperature at a height of 300 m is +16.4°C (see 
diagram).  
Figure 7.6 
The wind blows a parcel of unsaturated air up 
the hill and that air cools adiabatically at rate of 
1.0°C/100 m and at 300 m has cooled to 17°C. 
This air is now warmer than the environment 
and hence less dense so will continue to rise. 
This is an unstable situation.
Now the wind blows a parcel of saturated air 
up the hill which cools at 0.6°C/100 m, cooling 
to a temperature of 18.2°C at 300 m.  This air 
is also warmer than the environment and will 
also continue to rise and is hence unstable.
In this scenario when the ELR is greater than 
the DALR, the air is unstable for both dry and 
saturated air.  We call this situation absolute 
instability.
ELR > DALR: ABSOLUTE INSTABILITY

Absolute Stability
Let us now take the same situation except that the radiosonde ascent shows a lapse rate of 
0.4°C/100 m, giving an environmental temperature at 300 m of 18.8°C.
Figure 7.8 
Once again the parcel of dry air is blown up the 
hill cooling adiabatically to 17°C.  This parcel 
of air is now cooler and therefore denser than 
the environment and will now descend on the 
opposite side of the hill to its starting position. 
Now we have a stable situation.
The saturated air as it is blown up the hill will 
cool to 18.2°C and it too will be colder than 
the environment and will roll down the other 
side of the hill.
This time we have stable conditions for both 
dry and saturated air which we term absolute 
stability.
ELR < SALR: ABSOLUTE STABILITY

Conditional Instability
Now we will look at what happens when the radiosonde ascent shows an average lapse rate of 
0.8°C/100 m over the first few hundred metres giving an environmental temperature of 17.6°C 
at a height of 300 m.
Figure 7.10 
The parcel of dry air is blown up the hill and 
cools as before to 17°C.  This air is now colder 
than the environment and will descend on 
the other side of the hill, the stable condition. 
The saturated air will cool to 18.2°C as it is 
blown up the hill. Now the saturated air 
is warmer than the environment and will 
continue to rise, the unstable condition.
The stability of the air is now dependent on 
whether the air is saturated or unsaturated. 
This state is known as conditional instability, 
where 
the 
atmosphere 
is 
stable 
for 
unsaturated (dry) air and unstable for 
saturated air.
DALR > ELR >SALR: CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY
Note: The term ‘conditional stability’ is not a meteorological term and, if seen in the answer to 
an examination question, can be confidently deleted as an incorrect answer.

Neutral Stability
If the ELR is the same as the DALR then the temperature at 300 m will be 17°C.
Figure 7.12 
The unsaturated air blown up the hill will cool to 17°C as it rises.  The uplifted air now has the 
same temperature and hence density as the environment, so it will now remain at 300 m.  This 
situation is known as neutral (or indifferent) stability for unsaturated (dry) air.
A similar argument holds for saturated air, however this is less likely since the value of the SALR 
is a function of both temperature and pressure and is more complex.
ELR = DALR: NEUTRAL STABILITY, for unsaturated (dry) air
(ELR = SALR: NEUTRAL STABILITY, for saturated air)

Turbulence
Introduction
A dictionary definition of turbulence is a ‘disturbed state’ and so from the aviation point of 
view this would mean disturbed or rough air. There are different ways in which this turbulence 
is caused and also different parts of the atmosphere where it occurs.
Windshear
Windshear is the sudden change in speed and/or direction of the wind including vertical 
currents.  These changes affect the energy of the aircraft and that change in energy is felt 
inside the aircraft as turbulence
Vertical Windshear: change in speed and/or direction with change of height, measured in 
knots per 100 feet.
Horizontal Windshear: change in speed and/or direction in the horizontal plane, measured in 
knots per 1000 feet.
Locations
Turbulence occurs:
•	 In the friction layer.
•	 In clouds - This will be discussed in detail in the chapters on clouds and thunderstorms.
•	 In clear air.
The Friction Layer 
The friction layer is the lower part of the atmosphere extending from the surface to a height of 
2000 ft to 3000 ft above the surface.  The depth of the friction layer depends on:
•	 The roughness of the terrain.  The rougher the surface the greater the strength of the 
(vertical) deflection and hence the greater the height to which it will penetrate.
•	 The wind speed.  The higher the speed the greater will be the deflection.
•	 The stability of the layer.  Stable conditions will resist vertical movement and hence limit the 
depth.
Within the friction layer there are 2 sources of turbulence:
•	 Convection from thermal currents
•	 Frictional or mechanical turbulence
By day the presence of thermal currents will tend to reduce low level stability and hence 
increase the depth of the friction layer, whereas at night there is only mechanical turbulence so 
the stability will tend to increase because of the surface cooling and the depth of the friction 
layer will reduce.
At night the surface cooling, particularly with clear skies, can lead to the formation of low 
level inversions.  Now vertical mixing is inhibited and the surface frictional effect is enhanced. 
This means that below an inversion the wind speed will be light with a significantly different 
direction to the much stronger wind above the inversion.  Hence Windshear will occur at the 
inversion.  An aircraft climbing (or descending) through the inversion will experience a rapid

Turbulence
change in speed and direction giving, possibly, moderate to severe turbulence.  This and other 
low level effects are discussed in the Aeronautical Information Circular (AIC) at the end of this 
chapter.
Thermal Turbulence
Insolation gives rise to convection currents. 
The intensity of these currents depends on 
the heating of the surface.  Surfaces like rock 
and concrete heat rapidly and give rise to 
strong vertical currents, whereas grass and 
wooded areas will only heat slowly and create 
weak convection currents. So flight within the 
friction layer on a sunny day will be affected 
by variable speed vertical currents and hence 
windshear giving turbulence.
Thermal 
turbulence 
is 
greatest 
around 
1500 hrs on clear sunny days.  There is no 
thermal turbulence over the sea.
Mechanical Turbulence
This is caused by physical obstructions to the 
normal flow of air such as hills, mountains, 
coasts, trees and buildings. 
Mountain Waves (MTW)
Mountain waves may also be referred to as 
standing waves or lee waves.  These occur 
when the following conditions exist:
•	
The wind direction is perpendicular to 
the mountain range (+/-30°) without 
significant change in direction as 
altitude increases
•	
The wind speed at the summits is at 
least 15 kt with speed increasing as 
altitude increases
•	
A marked layer of stability around 
the altitude of the summits, e.g. an 
isothermal layer or inversion, with less 
stable air above and below

Turbulence
The resultant waves can extend for hundreds of miles downwind of the range if suitable 
conditions prevail.  The waves may extend well above the tropopause and the wave form may 
be seen in cirrus clouds high in the troposphere and also in noctilucent clouds which occur at 
altitudes around 250 000 ft in the upper mesosphere.
Turbulence Effects of Mountain Waves
Most severe turbulence can occur in the Rotor Zone lying beneath the crests of lee waves 
and is often marked by Roll Clouds. The most powerful rotor lies beneath the first wave crest 
(one wavelength downwind). Flight in waves can be smooth, but severe turbulence may occur. 
Occasionally violent turbulence will occur, due to wave ‘breaking’.
Normal turbulence associated with flight across jet streams is frequently greatly increased 
when the jet passes over mountainous areas, particularly when mountain waves are present.
It has been found that turbulence caused in the troposphere due to mountain waves may 
continue well into the stratosphere. An aircraft flying close to its ceiling on these occasions 
might find itself in serious difficulty.
Visual Recognition Features of Mountain Waves
Provided there is sufficient moisture in the atmosphere, distinctive clouds are formed with 
mountain waves and these provide useful warning of the presence of such waves. The clouds 
are:
•	 Lenticular, or lens shaped clouds which form on the crests of the waves. They may appear 
above the mountain tops and in the crests of the waves downwind.  They may be found up 
to, and possibly above, the tropopause. Ragged edges indicate turbulence.
•	 Rotor, or roll-clouds occur under the crests of strong waves downwind of the ridge. The 
strongest rotor is normally formed in the first wave downwind and will be level or slightly 
above the ridge crest.
•	 Cap clouds form on the ridge and strong winds may sweep the cloud down the lee slopes.
Note:	
•	 The characteristic clouds above may be obscured by other clouds and the presence of 
standing waves may thus not be evidenced.
•	 If the air is dry, clouds may not form at all, even though mountain waves are present.
Action to Avoid the Worst Effects of Mountain Waves
•	 Read the Met. Forecast.
•	 Arrange to cross mountain ranges at 90 degrees.
•	 Fly at the recommended turbulence penetration speed.
•	 Do not fly parallel to and just downwind of the range at any altitude.
•	 Avoid flight through or near the rotor zone.

•	 Avoid flight levels within 5000 ft of stable layer where severe turbulence is most likely.
•	 Allow a height clearance above highest ground at least equal to the height of that ground 
above local terrain.
•	 Avoid low altitude flight towards the mountain range from the lee side. Aircraft height 
variations will be out of phase with waves and downdraughts will be hazardous.
•	 Avoid high altitude flight on the lee side of the mountain range downwind. Buffet margin 
at high level may be small, and speed of approaching standing waves will be high, with 
subsequently greater loads applied to the airframe.
•	 Be prepared for icing in cloud.
Rotor Streaming
If the winds approaching a 
mountain range are strong 
only at lower levels and fall off 
or reverse direction at higher 
levels, Rotor Streaming may 
result. This comprises violent 
rotors 
moving 
downwind 
from the ridge. Unlike the 
stationary rotors described 
above, these rotors travel 
downwind 
after 
forming 
on the lee slopes, Figure 8.4 
shows rotor streaming.
Jet Streams
Jetstreams 
are 
narrow 
fast 
moving 
currents 
of 
air which occur just below 
the tropopause and will be 
discussed in detail in the 
chapter on upper winds. 
Generally 
the 
associated 
turbulence is found on the 
cold air side of the Jet Stream 
just below the core where 
the 
greatest 
windshear 
occurs, with a secondary area 
above the core extending 
into the stratosphere as the 
winds rapidly decrease in 
strength.  The turbulence 
will be more severe with 
curved jets, developing and 
rapidly moving jets and in 
mountainous areas, particularly when mountain waves are present.

Turbulence
If turbulence is encountered at high altitude as well as reducing speed to the rough air 
penetration speed the pilot should also descend.  At high altitude the margins to high and low 
speed buffet may be quite small and the effect of the turbulence may put the aircraft into high 
or low speed stall.  Descent will increase these margins thus enhancing the aircraft safety.
Cumulonimbus Clouds
Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds 
and their associated hazards 
will be discussed in detail in 
later chapters.  Turbulence 
will be found within CB with 
strong 
vertical 
currents. 
These vertical currents cause 
air to be drawn in from 
around the cloud creating 
turbulence and the energy 
of the air rising in the cloud 
is transmitted to above the 
cloud creating turbulence. 
Below the cloud the inflow 
and outflow of air creates 
severe turbulence at low 
altitude and the possibility of 
microbursts (or downbursts) 
create a potentially fatal 
hazard.  The hazard of these microbursts is discussed in the AIC at the end of this chapter.
Turbulence around Upper Level Troughs and Ridges
Since upper level winds are stronger than those at the surface, the sharp changes in wind 
direction at upper level troughs are likely to produce considerable horizontal windshear and 
consequent disturbance which may be experienced as Clear Air Turbulence (CAT).
As upper level ridges tend to be more gently curved than troughs, the direction changes and 
consequent turbulence will be less severe.

Turbulence Reporting Criteria
Turbulence remains an important operational factor at all levels but particularly above FL150. 
The best information on turbulence is obtained from pilots’ Special Aircraft Observations; 
all pilots encountering turbulence are requested to report time, location, level, intensity 
and aircraft type to the ATS Unit with whom they are in radio contact. High level turbulence 
(normally above FL150 not associated with cumuliform cloud, including thunderstorms) should 
be reported as TURB, preceded by the appropriate intensity or preceded by Light or Moderate 
Chop. (Note: EASA still refer to clear air turbulence as CAT.)

and type of aircraft. All locations should be readily identifiable. Turbulence reports should be made when 
moderate/severe turbulence is encountered, or on request. Example:

(b)  From 50 miles north of Glasgow to 30 miles west of Heathrow 1210, occasional moderate Chop TURB, FL 330, MD80.

2.4 _ If the basic windshear definition in paragraph 2.2 (a) is set aside, it can be seen that the additional definitions and qualifying
statements allow for changes in wind vector which could include the relatively minor or benign. Notwithstanding these possible
(academic) variations in description, this circular is concerned with the basic definition, in particular, the emphasis on abrupt
displacement of an aircraft from the desired flight path, at low altitude, together with the necessity for substantial control action to
counteract it. Windshear is therefore highly dynamic which can be extremely uncomfortable and frightening; to think of windshear as an
aggravated form of wind gradient is unwise. Windshear can strike suddenly and with devastating effect beyond the recovery powers of
both experienced pilots flying the most modern and powerful aircraft. Thus the first and most vital defence is avoidance; this
should be taken to be the recurrent theme of the rest of this circular.

3 Meteorological Background

3.1. Among the most potent examples of windshear are those associated with thunderstorms, however, windshear can also be
experienced in association with other meteorological features such as the passage of a front, a marked temperature inversion, a low
level jet (wind maximum) or a turbulent boundary layer. Topography or buildings can create substantial local windshear effects that can
be considerably more than might be expected from the average strength of a prevailing wind.

3.2 Thunderstorms

3.2.1 The principles of thunderstorm formation are already covered in AIC 81/2004 (Pink 66). For the purposes of this Circular it is
sufficient to remark that thunderstorms are violent events, unpredictable, and associated with turbulence, windshear, lightning and
precipitation as separate or joint hazards. Shears will occur, and draughts can strike from all angles. The assessment of the aircraft's
actual angle of attack in relation to some of the wind flows will be difficult to judge and in consequence the closeness of the aircraft to
the stall will be harder to gauge. In relation to low altitude windshear there are features of thunderstorms which merit further
description:

(a) Gust Front: Some thunderstorms may have a well-defined area of cold air flowing out from a downdraught, but tending to
lead the storm along its line of movement. This is labelled a "gust front" (see Figure 1) and may extend some distance (up
to 30 km) from the storm centre and affect the area from the surface up to 6000 ft. If the storm is part of an organised line of
storms, the gust front may extend an even greater distance from the centre line of the storms. ‘Gust fronts’ manifest
themselves as regions of great turbulence with a potential for vertical shears between out-flowing cold air as it undercuts
warmer air. The leading edge of the ‘gust front’ could be encountered without warning, although roll cloud effects can be
associated with it.

(b) Microburst: A microburst is a highly concentrated and powerful downdraught of air, typically less that 5 km across, which
lasts for about 1 to 5 minutes. (It should be noted that the word ‘microburst’ is also associated with a phenomenon called
‘gap flow microburst’, associated with topographical effects and strong winds and is a very strong horizontal shear effect
with the energy loss effect on the aircraft as shown in Figure 2). Microbursts associated with thunderstorms have proved to
be a most lethal form of windshear giving downdraught speeds of 60 kt or more. As this vertical shaft of air approaches the
ground it will ‘splay out’ and lose its vertical speed component, nevertheless, vertical (downward) components have been
recorded as low as 300 ft with surface wind differences of as much as 90 kt. Although these figures are extreme examples
they do illustrate that a microburst should not be treated lightly. Microbursts have been well documented in the United
States but could easily be found elsewhere in association with thunderstorm activity. Microbursts can be ‘wet’ or ‘dry’, ie
associated with or without precipitation. The ‘dry’ microbursts will therefore be difficult to detect on weather radar, but are
often associated with high-based cumulus, alto-cumulus or the cirrus cloud overhang from a cumulonimbus cloud. In each
case when precipitation falls from the clouds (indicated by ‘virga’) it evaporates in the dry air beneath the cloud. This
evaporation process requires energy, which further cools the falling air thus enhancing the speed of the downdraught. A
‘wet’ microburst is associated with intense precipitation that falls in shafts below a cumulonimbus cloud.

3.3 Frontal Passage

3.3.1 Fronts vary in strength and normally only well-developed active fronts, with narrow surface frontal zones and with marked
temperature differences between the two air masses are likely to carry a windshear risk. Weather charts showing sharp changes in
wind direction across the front, temperature differences of 5°C or more, or a speed of frontal advance in the region of 30 kt or more may
indicate a potential windshear hazard. Frontal windshear is also a hazard as the following incident illustrates. A twin-jet aircraft was
about to land in the UK and was caught by the passage of a cold front. In 10 seconds, the wind changed such that a 10 kt crosswind
from the left (with a slight tail wind) changed to an 8 kt crosswind from the right coupled with a 14 kt head wind. A missed approach,
from very low level was carried out as directional control became difficult. The actual numerical values of wind speed change in this
actual incident may appear less than dramatic to some readers, however, the control difficulties experienced during this incident were
considerable. Similar wind velocity changes, with an aircraft at critical phases of flight will always be hazardous.

3.4 Inversions

3.4.1 A change in wind strength is nearly always present in the boundary layer, ie close to the ground. This is frequently described as
‘windshear’ but as this normally involves a gradual change in strength with which pilots will be most familiar, it does not fit the definition
already given in this circular. A proper windshear hazard can exist, however, when an unexpectedly strong vertical change develops.
This is often associated with the following situations:

(a) A low level jet (more accurately referred to as a low level wind maximum) can form just below the top of, or sometimes
within, a strong radiation inversion which may develop at night under clear skies. Other low level jets may develop in
association with a surface front, particularly ahead of cold fronts.

(b) On occasions, low-level inversions may develop and decouple a relatively strong upper flow from layers of stagnant or slow
moving air near the surface. Shear effects may be pronounced across the interface.

4 The Effects of Windshear on an Aircraft in Flight

4.1. Windshear will affect aircraft in many different ways and during an encounter the situation will be constantly changing, especially
during the more dynamic encounters. Conventional thought, in the past, has suggested that such encounters are associated only with
thunderstorms; however, there is evidence to show that equally dynamic encounters can be expected with other windshear causes.
Particular types of aircraft will vary in their reaction to a given shear; a light high wing piston-engined aircraft may react in a totally
different way to a heavy four-engined swept wing jet aircraft. The notes and diagrams that follow describe stylised windshears and the
progressive effects that can occur. Windshear can be encountered at any height and the effects will be similar. If the windshear event
is at low-level it can be a great hazard and it is this that must be borne in mind in relation to the described effects.

4.2 To understand the effects of windshear it is important to note the relationship of an aircraft to two reference points. One
reference point is the ground below the aircraft and the other is the air mass in which the aircraft is moving. In a windshear encounter it
is not only the magnitude of the change of the wind vector, but the rate at which it occurs. For example, an aeroplane at 1000 ft above
ground level (agl) may have a head wind component of some 30 kt, but the aerodrome surface report shows this as a 10 kt component
close to the runway. That 20 kt difference in wind strength may taper off evenly from 1000 ft to touchdown with no changes in direction;
thus its effect and relationship to the aircraft will be that of a reasonable wind gradient with height with which all pilots will be familiar.
On the other hand, if the 20 kt difference still exists at 300 ft, it will be obvious that the change, when it occurs, is going to be far more
sudden and its effect more marked. Windshear, from the definition, implies a narrow borderline, and the 20 kt of wind strength may be
lost over a short vertical distance. If this strength is lost over 100 ft the effect will be as shown in the diagram, with the concomitant loss
of aircraft energy.

4.3. The reverse effect will occur when an aeroplane is taking off through such a shear line. In this case however, the gain in energy
would be beneficial with aircraft gaining some additional 20 kt of airspeed in a short distance. However, this could potentially produce
some handling difficulties, particularly if the aircraft was approaching a flap limiting speed (for example) as the shear line was crossed.

Figure 3 : Effect of Increased headwind - Energy Gain
APT M9707 63.97

4.4 In an encounter with a downdraught, the relative airflow across the aircraft's wing will change direction. Normally, an aircraft
could be expected to be flying into a head wind and as the downdraught is encountered, this head wind will reduce markedly, thus
reducing the energy of the aircraft. In the downdraught itself, the relative airflow across the wing will change as shown in the diagram
below. Its effect will be to effectively decrease the angle of attack of the wing, which will be counteracted by the pilot manoeuvring the
aircraft in response to the downburst effect, ie increasing the angle of attack. This might be beneficial in terms of increased lift.
However, if the wing is already at steep attack angle (eg during an approach), any subsequent changes in airflow may result in the
aircraft being very close to the stall.

4.5 Another version of a windshear event is that occasioned by an encounter with a microburst. Classically, a microburst, as
illustrated below, is associated with thunderstorm or similar convective activity associated with areas of heavy rain. However, the term
‘microburst’ is also associated, in some locations, with very severe windshear warnings, possibly without associated convective activity.
(See paragraph 3.6 (c)). Therefore, if ‘microburst’ warnings are given, flight crew should be fully aware of which phenomenon
they are being warned about and take appropriate action.

4.6 The likely sequence of events during a classic (convective activity) microburst encounter is a combination of the previous events
as follows. Approaching the airfield, using the aircraft weather radar, an area of strong radar returns may be observed in the vicinity of
the final approach path. This may alert the pilot to the possible dangers, particularly if this is also associated with earlier meteorological
forecasts. The recommended course of action would be to initiate a go-around at this early stage in the approach and hold off until the
activity moved on. Some airfields may even prohibit approaches during conditions when microburst activity is anticipated. If after the
initiation of the go-around, an encounter with the microburst occurred at this stage, the extra energy of the aircraft and possible
increased height should ensure that no untoward events occur.

4.7 _ If, however, the aircraft were to continue its approach into the microburst, the sequence of probable events is as shown in the
diagram. A successful go-around will depend, obviously, on the strength of the microburst, its position in relation to the approach path;
the aircraft power reserves available and the rate at which they can be increased to give maximum thrust to counteract the energy loss
of downdraught and increasing tail wind. The dynamic events will probably be associated with severe buffeting, heavy rain, thick cloud
and probably blinding flashes of lightning, and external noise occasioned by heavy rain or hail on the aircraft skin.

4.8 A microburst encounter during take-off could be equally as hazardous notwithstanding the fact that during take-off an aircraft is
already developing high thrust and is less constrained by the need to hold a precise glide path. Whilst the initial increase in head wind
may improve lift and thus rate of climb, the transition to downdraught and then tail wind may totally negate this increase and the
airspeed of the aircraft, possibly still close to the ground may be further reduced. A heavy aircraft, with small reserves of power may
not be able to fly through the encounter successfully.

5 Techniques to Counter the Effects of Windshear

5.1. It should now be apparent that windshear can vary enormously in its impact and effect. There is as yet no international
agreement on ways of grading windshears, but clearly some shears will be more severe and more dangerous than others. If the
definition used by this circular is borne in mind, a windshear encounter is expected to result in abrupt changes to the desired flight path
requiring considerable control action to effect recovery. Thus, if avoidance has failed, any further actions must anticipate the worst
effects, bearing in mind that the shear itself will probably be invisible to the crew.

5.2 _ If the meteorological situation has been carefully studied in advance of flight and updated with latest reports during flight, the
possibility of windshear should have already been identified. Strong winds at a destination, particularly where topography is warned as
having an effect, or a forecast of thunderstorms, particularly if reinforced, near the destination, with weather radar or visible evidence
should trigger a mental ‘Windshear Alert’. At this point the prudent decision would be to divert, following company procedures in the
case of AOC operators.

5.3 If an approach must be attempted in such conditions, crews should consider a few basic measures to anticipate a windshear
encounter. One such measure is to increase the approach speed, however, if a shear event does not materialise, the increased
approach speed may then cause problems near the threshold, particularly at airfields with short runways. If an encounter with shear
does occur, its overall effect will be to de-stabilise an approach, and any thrust reduction taken to counter an initial extra head wind,
may have to be quickly changed to a thrust increase if the head component is removed or reversed. Actions to counter a loss of
airspeed close to the ground include:

(a) Briskly increase power (to full go-around if felt necessary);
(b) Raise the nose to check descent;
(c) Co-ordinate power and pitch;

(d) Be prepared to carry out a missed approach rather than risk a landing from a de-stabilised approach.

5.4 The actions required to counter the effect of a downburst or microburst on the approach or during take-off will require more
stringent measures. Again, it should be emphasised that if such phenomena are either forecast or suspected, the most sensible course
of action would be to delay the take-off or landing, or if airborne to divert to another airfield. In the absence of specific aircraft flight
manual or operations manual guidance which must be followed, some suggested techniques for dealing with a microburst encounter
on an approach are given below:

(a) The presence of thunderstorms should be known and obvious, so that any increase in airspeed caused by the increasing
head wind should be seen as the precursor to a downburst or microburst encounter. Any hope, therefore, of a stabilised
approach should be abandoned and a missed approach is the recommended action - the technique is to make this as safe
as possible;

(b) The initial rise in airspeed and the rise above the approach path should be seen as a bonus and capitalised upon. Without
hesitation, the power should be increased to that required for a go-around, whilst being prepared to further increase it to
maximum, if necessary, and an appropriate pitch angle, consistent with a missed approach should be selected. Typically,
this will be in the region of 15° and this should be held against the buffeting and turbulence that will undoubtedly occur;

(c) The initial ‘bonus’ of speed and rate of climb may now be rapidly eroded as the downdraught is encountered. Airspeed may
now be lost and the aircraft may now begin to descend again despite the high power and pitch angle. It may be impossible
to gauge the angle of attack, so there is a possibility that stall warnings may be triggered; in such cases the pitch angle may
need to be relaxed slightly;

(d) The point at which the tail wind starts to be encountered may be the most critical. The rate of descent may lessen, but the
airspeed may continue to fall and any height loss may now be close to ground obstacle clearance margins. Maximum thrust
will by now have been applied and if there is now a risk of hitting the ground or an obstacle it may be necessary to raise the
nose until stall warnings start to be triggered and to hold this attitude until the aircraft starts to escape from the effects.

5.5 The likely effects of windshear on take-off have already been discussed in paragraph 4.3. When there is a possibility of shear,
without a clear forecast, it may be possible to use a longer runway, preferably pointing away from an area of potential threat. However,
this must not be a ‘spur of the moment’ action and any such decision will need to have been pre-planned taking into account all
necessary factors including runway length and obstacle clearances. The high power setting and high pitch angle after rotation may put
the aircraft in a reasonable situation should an encounter now occur, however, if it has not been fully thought out there may be
unexpected handling and performance difficulties. However, the aircraft will still be low, with a small safety margin. At that point,
maximum power should be selected (if it is not already); noise abatement procedures should be ignored and the high pitch attitude
(consistent with any stall warnings) should be maintained. Notwithstanding the above, the safest and recommended course of action
would be to delay take-off until the possibility of windshear has diminished.

5.6 The vital actions for downburst/microburst encounter in both approach and take-off cases are:

(a) Early recognition and committal to the appropriate action;

(b) Follow operations manual or aircraft flight manual techniques;

(c) Use maximum power available as soon as possible;

(d) Adopt an appropriate pitch angle and try and hold it; do not ‘chase’ airspeed.

(e) Be guided by stall warnings when holding or increasing pitch, easing the back pressure as required to attain or hold a lower
pitch attitude if necessary. (In many aircraft types optimum performance is very close to the point of onset of stall warning.
It is important, however, not to go beyond the point of onset as it is then not possible for the pilot to know how deeply into
the warning the aircraft is).

5.7 It is not possible to be prescriptive in relation to the ‘best’ technique to use as these will vary between aircraft, and may be
documented in appropriate manuals, but could be expected to follow the broad guidelines above. Some of the responses required of
the pilot and the attitude and trim forces to be used may sometimes appear to be counter-intuitive. Therefore, the best advice would be
to use a windshear training programme, coupled with dedicated simulator exercises to practice the techniques. Any such training
should emphasise the fact that windshears are to be avoided. The knowledge thus gained and any techniques practiced should serve
to make the survival of an inadvertent encounter more possible and not encourage pilots to think that windshears can be tackled with
impunity.

6 Windshear Warning and Reporting
6.1. Windshear warning is provided in the following ways:

(b) ATS warning;

(c) Pilot warnings;

(d) On board pre-encounter warnings.

6.2 Warning of windshear from meteorological sources may start at the pre-flight briefing stage and pinpoint the possibility of frontal
or inversion shear. Any forecast of thunderstorm activity should alert pilots to the possibility of downdraught or microburst activity. If
the planned destination is one where topographical features are known to cause shear hazards, the direction and strength of forecast
winds should be noted carefully and compared with published information. In the United Kingdom, windshear warnings are provided in
ATIS broadcasts at London (Heathrow) and Belfast (Aldergrove) if the following conditions exist:

(a) The mean surface wind exceeds 20 kt;
(b) The vector difference between the mean surface wind and the gradient wind at about 2000 ft exceeds 40 kt;

(c) Thunderstorms or heavy showers are within about 5 nm of the airfields.

The warnings are broadcast as ‘Windshear Forecasts’, and if reinforced by pilot (aircraft) reports, the alert becomes ‘Windshear
forecast and reported’. (See UK AIP GEN 3-5-4 for more information).

6.3 In other parts of the world, windshear warnings can be based not just on meteorological forecasts but on actual observed
conditions using, for example, a series of anemometers around an airfield. With such systems, the measured differences in wind
velocity between anemometers are used in conjunction with computer programmes and recorded data to produce warnings. Terminal
Doppler Weather Radars (TDWR) are also used to measure wind velocities and these can also be configured to produce warnings.
However, a note of caution is necessary. It will have been noted that no universal standard exists regarding the grading of the
severity of windshear, nor is there a universal standard regarding windshear warnings. Furthermore, the term ‘microburst’ is not always
used to describe the classic thunderstorm associated event. ‘Microburst’ is also used to alert crews to the possibility of a shear event
from wind over 30 kt. In this context, it is not a microburst in the sense as shown in Figure 5 (and the associated text). In addition,
some locations use a ‘Maximum intensity, first encounter’ rule, in warnings. This results in warnings as follows:

‘Windshear warning, 25 kt, 3 nm final’

This could be interpreted as ‘expect an encounter of 25 kt at 3 nm on final approach’. This is incorrect. The correct interpretation (as a
result of maximum intensity, first encounter) is:

‘Expect encounter(s) with windshear somewhere between 3 nm and touchdown with a maximum intensity of 25 kt’
It should be noted in this context that an aircraft belonging to a UK airline experienced such events with a maximum intensity in the
region of 35 (or more) kt ie an encounter with a ‘gap-flow microburst’ at an approximate height of 150 ft on an approach. From all the

available evidence, it would appear that the loss of an aircraft, crew and passengers was very narrowly avoided.

6.4 _ Pilot reports of windshear encounters are important sources of information to warn other pilots of the danger. The UK AIP (GEN 3-5-21)
contains guidance on windshear reporting, which for convenience is repeated below. In this context it should be noted that similar entries in
the AIPs of other States may be slightly different and may require the use of different terminology or phraseology.

‘Windshear Reporting Criteria

Pilots using navigation systems providing direct wind velocity readout should report the wind and altitude/height above and
below the shear layer, and its location. Other pilots should report the loss or gain of airspeed and/or the presence of up or
down draughts or a significant change in cross wind effect, the altitude/height and location, their phase of flight and aircraft
type. Pilots not able to report windshear in these specific terms should do so in terms of its effect on the aircraft, the
altitude/height and location and aircraft type, for example, ‘Abrupt windshear at 500 ft QFE on finals, maximum thrust
required, B747'. Pilots encountering windshear are requested to make a report even if windshear has previously been
forecast or reported’.

6.5 As yet, no perfect on-board system is available for general use and trials continue in this respect. Some aircraft are fitted with
predictive windshear warning system, but in most cases the pilot will not receive much advance warning of the presence of windshear.
Airborne weather radar may give some clues, however, it must be remembered that most weather radars do not detect turbulence; they
only detect precipitation. Warning that an aircraft is about to experience windshear may therefore come from a variety of sources, and
in this context it is probably important to ensure that the more sophisticated modern aircraft are configured for a possible encounter in
such a way that give the most warning and assistance to the pilot. Guidance for the best configuration to use will come from the
manufacturer and it is this that should be used. For less well-appointed aircraft, early clues may come from the airspeed and vertical
speed indicators; flight directors may be misleading when a windshear recovery is flown; again manufacturers’ guidance should be
sought. Finally, although visual clues may have assisted in the early prediction of a windshear event, they will not necessarily be
available during an event and its recovery. Similarly, physiological sensations should also be ignored and flight conducted purely by
reference to appropriate instruments.

7 Conclusions

7.1 Most pilots will experience changes in wind speed of some form or other; hopefully few will experience windshear as defined in
this circular when considerable control inputs will be required to overcome the abrupt changes that the shear encounter has caused.
There are no sure and absolute ways of determining the severity of an encounter; therefore the best advice must be to avoid them. If
an encounter does occur the generic advice in this circular together with further training and knowledge should help to alleviate the
effects.

Recognise —- that windshear is a hazard
and

Recognise - the signs that may indicate its presence

Avoid -—  windshear by delay or diversion

Prepare - for an inadvertent encounter by a ‘speed margin’ if ‘energy loss’ is expected

Recover - know the techniques recommended for your aircraft and use them without hesitation if windshear is
encountered

Report -— immediately to ATC controlling the airfield at which the incident occurred (see paragraph 6.4) and using the

Mandatory Occurrence Reporting Scheme, to the Civil Aviation Authority.

This Circular is issued for information, guidance and necessary action.

The Altimeter
An  altimeter is an instrument 
which 
measures 
pressure 
and causes a needle to move 
across a dial. The dial is 
calibrated in feet rather than 
pressure as we know that 
pressure decreases as altitude 
increases.
The instrument is calibrated 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
ICAO International Standard 
Atmosphere 
so 
that 
all 
altimeters 
will 
read 
the 
same altitude for the same 
pressure. (See previous notes 
on the need for the ISA.)
In addition, altimeters have a 
means of adjusting the needle 
setting to take changes in the 
surface atmospheric pressure 
into account.
Figure 9.1 shows how the 
altimeter reading will change 
with a change in pressure.
In Figure 9.2 section A, the 
pressure at the airfield, which 
is at sea level, is 1010 hPa. The 
altimeter reads zero feet.
In section B, the pressure at 
the airfield has fallen to 1000 
hPa and the altimeter, rather 
than showing a decrease in 
pressure, shows an increase 
in height.

•	 When flying at a constant indicated altitude, outside air pressure must remain the same. 
To achieve this we must fly along a pressure level. However, when we fly to an area of 
lower pressure, these pressure lines will dip, consequently our true altitude will decrease. 
Conversely when flying into a region of higher pressure, the pressure lines will rise and our 
true altitude will increase.
Figure 9.3 
HIGHER PRESSURE; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE
LOWER PRESSURE; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE
•	 Varying temperatures within the atmosphere have significant effects on the pressure and 
the shape of the pressure lines. Cold air will tend to compact and lower pressure lines whilst 
warm air will expand and raise pressure lines. Using Figure 9.4 you can see that when flying 
to a colder area at a constant indicated altitude your true altitude decreases. Conversely, 
when flying into warmer region your true altitude will increase.
Figure 9.4 
COLDER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE < INDICATED ALTITUDE
WARMER THAN ISA; TRUE ALTITUDE > INDICATED ALTITUDE
•	 There is a need to be able to reset the altimeter to take account of the fall in pressure. 
Consequently, if the altimeter is reset when the pressure changes, the altimeter will read 
correctly. We may, by altering the altimeter subscale setting, set QFE, QNH or SPS for use 
when we fly to ensure more accurate readings.

Altimeter Settings
QFE	 
The pressure measured at the aerodrome datum.  With QFE set on the altimeter, the altimeter 
will read zero when the aircraft is on the surface of the aerodrome.  When airborne, with QFE 
set, the altimeter reads the approximate height above the aerodrome.  QFE is always rounded 
down to the nearest hectopascal.

Forecast QNH	
The lowest forecast QNH within an area, forecast for one hour ahead. The 	altimeter will be 
in error, but as the setting is the lowest forecast, the actual pressure will always be higher, 
or at least equal to the forecast QNH, and the altimeter will read low (or safe) or the correct 
altitude. (See Figure 9.7).

Altimeter Errors
Apart from instrument errors, there are two errors of interest meteorologically. They are:
•	 Barometric Error - Errors caused by setting a pressure on the subscale other than the correct 
one. For calculations a height of 27 ft per hPa is used in all the meteorology syllabus altimetry 
questions to determine the difference between indicated and true height/altitude.
Figure 9.9 Barometric Error
•	 Temperature error - The altimeter is calibrated in accordance with the ICAO ISA.	
If the temperature is other than that in the ISA, the altimeter will be in error. Corrected 
altitude is calculated by using a navigational computer, or a correction table. HI-LO-HI will 
still apply. 
Altimeter Temperature Error Correction
•	 Pressure altimeters are calibrated to indicate true altitude under ISA conditions. Any 
deviation from ISA will result in erroneous readings, except that the altimeter will read 
the correct elevation of the airfield regardless of temperature when the aircraft is on the 
ground with QNH set.
•	 When temperatures are lower than ISA an aircraft’s true altitude will be lower than the 
altimeter reading.
•	 The error is proportional to the difference between actual and ISA temperature, and the 
vertical distance of the aircraft above the altimeter setting datum.
•	 The height correction is 4 feet per degree Celsius deviation from ISA per 1000 feet.  
     Note: the calculation must be made over the indicated height difference from the datum 
for the pressure setting.
•	 For example: When making an approach to an aerodrome at mean sea level in Siberia in 
January the decision height is 200 ft.  What is the true height when the indicated height is 
200 ft if the temperature is -50°C?

Error = 4×(-65) × 0.2 = -52  ft
Hence the true height is 148 ft!
This is clearly unacceptable so when carrying out an aerodrome or runway approach in 
temperatures colder than standard the indicated decision height/altitude or minimum 
descent height/altitude must be increased in accordance with the following table to ensure 
safe operation.

With temperatures colder than standard consideration must be given to the effect of 
temperature on terrain clearance.
For example:
A flight is planned at FL180 over Mont Blanc (elevation 15 782 ft).  The mean sea level pressure 
is 983 hPa, from an aerodrome at mean sea level, and the temperature of the air up to the 
summit is 25°C colder than ISA.  Determine the true altitude of the aircraft at Mont Blanc and 
hence the terrain clearance. Figure 9.10.
Figure 9.10
--- Page 140 ---
Altimetry

Altimetry
The indicated altitude is 18 000 ft above the 1013 hPa datum;  the height correction for the 30 
hPa pressure difference is: 
30 × 27 = 810 feet so the corrected altitude is 17 190 ft. Figure 9.11.
Figure 9.11 
The height correction for the temperature deviation from ISA is:
4 × (- 25) × 18 = -1800 ft
Hence the true altitude of the aircraft is 15 390 ft.  Figure 9.12.
Figure 9.12 
But Mont Blanc is 15 872 ft high so if we do not do something about it we will hit the mountain 
392 feet below the summit. To simplify the calculation use the formula:
true altitude = indicated altitude + (indicated altitude/1000 × ISA deviation × 4) + 27(actual 
pressure - pressure setting)

So in winter, particularly if flying close to safety altitude, the effect of temperature on true 
altitude must be taken into account.
For all of the following questions assume that 1 hPa = 27 ft. 
1. An aircraft is at an airfield with an elevation of 350 ft. The altimeter setting is 1002, but 
the actual QNH is 993. What is the altimeter reading? 
2. An aircraft is on an airfield, elevation 190 ft and has an altimeter reading of 70 ft with a 
setting of 1005. What is the actual QNH?. 
3. What is the altimeter reading if the setting is 978, the QNH 993 and the airfield 
elevation 770 ft? 
4. The regional pressure setting is 1012, the altimeter setting is 1022 and the indicated 
altitude is 4100 ft. Ahead is some high ground shown on the map as being at 3700 ft. 
Will the aircraft clear the high ground, and if so, by how much? 
(Answers on page 137)
Minimum Safe Flight Level
Minimum safe flight level is the minimum indicated pressure altitude (using SPS 1013 hPa) that 
will ensure the aircraft is not lower than the safety attitude for each section of the route.
When route planning we must ensure that on all sections of the route the selected flight level 
is at or above the safety altitude for that section.  This means that we have to take account of 
both expected minimum pressure (QNH) and minimum temperature for each section of the 
route.
For example:  on a section of a route the safety altitude is 8300 ft, the forecast QNH is 983 hPa 
and the temperature is ISA -30°, determine the minimum safe flight level for that section of the 
route. Figure 9.13.
Figure 9.13 
The correction for pressure difference is 30 × 27 = 810 ft, giving a minimum indicated pressure 
altitude of 9110 ft.  The temperature correction is 4 × (-30) × 9 = -1080 ft so the minimum 
indicated pressure altitude required is 10 190 ft. Figure 9.14.

Winds
Introduction
Wind is air in horizontal motion. Wind Velocity (W/V) has both direction and speed.
Wind direction is always given as the direction from which the wind is blowing; this is illustrated 
in Figure 10.1. It is normally given in degrees true, but wind direction given to a pilot by ATC will 
be given in degrees magnetic.
Figure 10.1 Wind direction
Wind speed is usually given in knots, but 
some countries give the speed in metres per 
second (ms-1) and the Met. Office often work 
internally in kilometres per hour, shown as 
KMH on reports and forecasts.
On the wind vector the wind direction is from 
the feathers to the point which indicates the 
location of the wind.  The illustrated wind 
Figure 10.2 is 240° (true) at 125 kt.  It should 
be noted that, by convention, the feathers 
always point towards the low pressure.
Veering  is a change of wind direction in a 
clockwise direction.
Backing is a change of wind direction in an 
anticlockwise direction. This applies in both 
hemispheres.

Winds
Gusts
A gust is a sudden increase in wind speed, often with a change in direction lasting less than one 
minute and it is a local effect. A gust will only be reported or forecast if 10 kt or more above 
the mean wind speed.
A lull is a sudden decrease in wind speed.
Squalls
A squall is a sudden increase in wind speed, often with a change in direction. Lasting for one 
minute or more and can cover a wide area. It is often associated with cumulonimbus cloud 
and cold fronts.
Gale
A gale exists when the sustained wind speed exceeds 33 kt, or gusts exceed 42 kt.
Hurricane
A hurricane force wind exists when sustained wind speed exceeds 63 kt.
Measurement of Winds
Surface wind is measured by a 
wind vane which aligns itself 
with the wind direction, and an 
anemometer which measures 
the speed. An anemometer 
is a set of 3 hemispherical 
cups which rotate on a shaft 
with the effect of the wind. 
The speed of rotation of the 
shaft is directly proportional 
to the wind speed. The 
rotation is used to drive a 
small generator, the output 
of which is then displayed on 
a gauge which is calibrated in 
knots.
The ICAO requirement is 
that the wind vane and 
anemometer 
should 
be 
positioned 10 m (33 ft) above 
aerodrome level and located 
clear of buildings and obstructions which could affect the airflow and hence accuracy. An 
anemograph records wind speed and direction.
Upper winds are measured by GPS tracking of a radiosonde and by aircraft reports.

Winds
Wind
Wind is generated by the pressure differences between high and low pressure systems which 
give rise to what we call the pressure gradient force (PGF) the change of pressure over distance. 
The PGF acts directly from high pressure to low pressure. 
The spacing of the isobars determines the magnitude of the force, the closer together the 
isobars the greater the pressure difference and hence the PGF and thus the wind speed.
Buys Ballot’s Law tells us that if we stand with our back to the wind in the Northern Hemisphere 
low pressure is on the left (right in the Southern Hemisphere).  This implies that the wind does 
not flow directly from high pressure to low pressure but parallel to the isobars.  Examination 
of an analysis chart will show that the surface wind does indeed flow nearly parallel to the 
isobars and we will see that above the friction layer the wind, generally does flow parallel to 
the isobars.  There are two winds that we need to consider:
•	 The Geostrophic Wind
•	 The Gradient Wind
The Geostrophic Wind
As with any theorized wind or model wind, a number of assumptions must be made to reduce 
the complexity of reality and make the model more simplistic. These are as follows:
•	 The Geostrophic Wind is said to have only two forces. 
•	 These must be working opposite from each other and in balance. 
These two forces are:
Pressure Gradient Force (PGF)
•	 Pressure Gradient Force, 
(PGF), is the force that acts 
from a high pressure to a 
low pressure.
•	 We can see the strength 
of this force by studying 
the 
spacing 
between 
isobars. 
Closely 
spaced 
isobars would indicate a 
large pressure gradient 
force. This is common 
in low pressure systems. 
Widely 
spaced 
isobars 
indicate a small pressure 
gradient force.	
This is 
common in high pressure 
systems.

•	 The Pressure Gradient Force, (PGF), controls the wind speed. A large pressure gradient 
force would create strong winds, whereas a small pressure gradient force would create light 
winds. Wind speed is directly proportional to the pressure gradient force.
•	 The relationship between the isobar spacing, the pressure gradient force and the wind 
speed can be seen in the Geostrophic Wind Scale (GWS). Using Figure 10.6, take the distance 
between two isobars and reading from left to right, measure the geostrophic wind speed 
using the geostrophic wind scale shown at the bottom of the diagram. You will notice the 
wider the spacing of the isobars, the lighter the wind.
Figure 10.6 Geostrophic wind scale
Coriolis Force (CF)
•	 Coriolis Force, (CF), is the force caused by the rotation of the earth.
•	 It acts 90° to the wind direction causing air to turn to the right or veer in the Northern 
Hemisphere and to the left or back in the Southern hemisphere. CF is maximum at the 
poles and minimum at the Equator.

Winds
•	 The Coriolis force is not a true force but is an explanation of the effect the rotation of the 
earth has on a free moving body not in contact with the earth.  It is the combination of 4 
factors:
CF	 = 2 Ω ρ V sin θ, where:
	
Ω  	 = angular rotation of the earth
ρ 	
= density
V	
= wind speed
θ 	
= latitude
•	 It should be noted that the CF is directly proportional to both wind speed and latitude. So 
an increase in either will result in an increase in the CF.
Geostrophic Wind
•	 The Geostrophic Wind blows parallel to straight isobars. Therefore the geostrophic wind 
can only blow in a straight line. If the wind were to follow a curved path, it cannot be 
considered as a geostrophic wind because there will be additional forces involved, namely 
the centrifugal or centripetal forces. The gradient wind (which will be discussed later) uses 
the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force. This is the model for 
wind which follows a curved path.
•	 How can we know the direction of the geostrophic wind along the isobar? If you remember 
from earlier lessons, Buys Ballot’s Law told us that in the Northern Hemisphere with your 
back to the wind, the low pressure is to your left. In the Southern Hemisphere with your 
back to the wind, the low pressure is on your right. Looking at the diagram below and by 
using Buys Ballot’s Law, we can see a geostrophic wind direction of 180°.
Figure 10.8 Geostrophic wind direction in the Northern Hemisphere

Winds
•	 How can we know the speed of the geostrophic wind? If you remember from earlier, there 
was a correlation between the isobar spacing, the pressure gradient force and the wind 
speed. The geostrophic wind scale allowed us to quantify this relationship. Measure the 
distance perpendicular between the isobars and use that distance on the geostrophic wind 
scale, reading from left to right.
Figure 10.9 Latitude corrected geostrophic wind scale
•	 The geostrophic wind only blows above the friction layer. Within the friction layer 
the wind speed is reduced because of surface friction. Therefore the Coriolis force will 
reduce, causing the two forces to be out of balance. Remember that the friction layer 
varies depending upon the nature of the surface and the time of the day. Therefore, the 
height of the geostrophic wind will vary. Generally though it is considered to be between 
2000 - 3000 ft.
•	 With the geostrophic wind the pressure gradient force is equal to the Coriolis force.  So, 
for the same PGF (or isobar spacing) as latitude increases the Coriolis force will remain 
constant so for the same PGF as latitude increases, sine of latitude also increases and 
hence the wind speed will decrease.  This can be deduced from the geostrophic wind 
scale on the chart above where a certain isobar spacing at 40°N gives a wind speed of 
25 kt.  The same isobar spacing at 70°N gives a speed of only 15 kt.  (Note, for this type 
of question the key is “same PGF“ or “same isobar spacing”).
V = 
PGF
2 Ω ρ sinθ
So the effect of latitude must be accounted for when using the geostrophic wind scale. The 
diagram below shows the geostrophic wind scale for latitude between 40° and 70°. Notice 
that the same spacing between the isobars at high latitude gives a slower wind speed when 
compared to lower latitude. Within 5 degrees of the Equator the CF is close to zero. Within 15 
degrees the CF is very small, so that the geostrophic formula is no longer valid.

Winds
Construction of the Geostrophic Wind
Look at the diagram below for the Northern Hemisphere. Air is being accelerated towards the 
low pressure but in doing so, the strength of the Coriolis force is increasing. The wind is being 
deflected to the right until the two forces are acting opposite from each other and the wind 
now blows parallel to the isobar. With your back to the wind, the low pressure is on your left.
Figure 10.10 The geostrophic wind
Conditions Necessary for the Wind to Be Geostrophic
For the wind to be geostrophic, it has to occur:
•	 Above the friction layer.
•	 At a latitude greater than 15 degrees.
•	 When the pressure situation is not changing rapidly.
•	 With the isobars straight and parallel.
The geostrophic wind can apply at all heights above the friction layer. However, with an 
increase in height, the wind speed should increase due to the reduction in density assuming all 
other factors are unchanged.
The Gradient Wind
The gradient wind occurs when the isobars are curved. This brings into play a force which 
makes the wind follow a curved path parallel to the isobars. The gradient wind then is the wind 
which blows parallel to curved isobars due to a combination of 3 forces:
•	 PGF
•	 CF
•	 Centrifugal Force

Centrifugal Force
Centrifugal force is the force acting perpendicular to the direction of rotation and away from 
the centre of rotation. 
Figure 10.11 
Gradient Wind in a Depression
If air is moving steadily around a depression, then the centrifugal force opposes the PGF and 
therefore reduces the wind speed.
Figure 10.12  Gradient wind speed around a depression (Northern Hemisphere)
The gradient wind speed around a depression is less than the geostrophic wind for the same 
isobar interval. Hence if the Geostrophic Wind Scale (GWS) is used, it will overread.

Winds
Gradient Wind in a High
In an anticyclone the centrifugal force is acting in the same direction as the PGF so increases the 
magnitude of the PGF.  Hence the wind speed will be greater than the equivalent geostrophic 
wind speed.
The gradient wind speed around an anticyclone 
is greater than the geostrophic wind for the 
same isobar interval. Hence if the Geostrophic 
Wind Scale (GWS) is used, it will underread. 
As an example in a system where the radius 
of curvature of the isobars is 500 NM and the 
geostrophic wind speed is 40 kt, the speed 
in a cyclonic system will be 34 kt and in an 
anticyclonic system 58 kt.
It should be noted that when discussing the 
gradient wind we are making a comparison 
of the wind in a low pressure system to 
the equivalent geostrophic wind and, as a 
separate argument, comparing the wind in a 
high pressure system with the equivalent geostrophic wind.  
We are not comparing the wind speed in a low pressure system with the wind speed in a 
high pressure system.
The Antitriptic Wind
The wind which blows in low latitudes where the CF is very small is called the antitriptic wind.
Winds below 2000 - 3000 ft (1 km).
Friction between moving air and the land surface will reduce wind speed near the ground.  This 
reduction also reduces the CF. This will cause the two forces in the geostrophic wind to be out 
of balance since now CF is less than PGF. The wind is now called a surface wind.
Since surface friction has reduced the wind 
velocity, resulting in a reduction in the Coriolis 
force, the PGF is now more dominant. This 
causes the wind to blow across the isobars 
towards the low.

Rough Rules
•	 On average in the Northern Hemisphere the surface wind over land is backed by 30 degrees 
from the geostrophic, or gradient wind  direction and its speed is reduced by 50%.  In the 
Southern Hemisphere, because of the opposite effect of the Coriolis force, the surface wind 
is veered from the 2000 ft wind, but the numerical values are the same.
Figure 10.15 An example of rough rules over land in the Northern 
Hemisphere
•	 Over the sea friction is very much less and the surface winds are closer to geostrophic values. 
Surface wind over the sea, in the Northern Hemisphere, is backed by 10 degrees from the 
geostrophic or gradient wind direction and speed reduced to 70% (surface winds will veer 
in the Southern Hemisphere).

Diurnal Variation of the Surface Wind
There can be a regular change in the surface wind in each 24 hour period.  It veers and increases 
by day reaching maximum strength about 1500 hrs. It backs and decreases thereafter with 
minimum strength around 30 minutes after sunrise.
This diurnal variation is due to thermal turbulence which mixes the air at the surface with 
air moving freely above. It is therefore most marked on clear sunny days, and particularly in 
unstable air masses, with sunny days and clear nights.

Diurnal Variation of 1500 ft and Surface Wind Velocity
•	 Figure 10.17 and Figure 10.18 show the effect of diurnal temperature variation on both the 
1500 ft W/V and the surface W/V.
Figure 10.18 Diurnal variation of 1500 ft wind velocity
•	 By Day. Thermal currents are greater on sunny days and at 1500 hours. They will cause 
interaction between the surface and the top of the friction layer. The 2000 ft W/V will with 
descent be increasingly affected by the surface friction and will therefore steadily reduce in 
speed and turn towards the low pressure. (Back in Northern Hemisphere or veer in Southern 
Hemisphere).
•	 By Night. Thermal currents cease. The top of the friction layer effectively drops below 
1500 ft where the W/V will assume 2000 ft direction and speed thus becoming faster and 
veering (NH). The surface W/V no longer has interaction with the stronger wind above 
and will therefore decrease and back (NH). Thus a marked windshear can occur between 
1500 ft and the surface, affecting handling for example on an approach.

Land and Sea Breezes
Sea breezes. On a sunny day, particularly in an anticyclone with a light PGF, the land will heat 
quickly. 
The air in contact will be warmed and will rise and expand so that pressure at about 1000 ft will 
be higher than pressure at the same level over the sea. This will cause a drift of air from over 
the land to over the sea at about 1000 ft. The drift of air will cause the surface pressure over 
the land to fall, and the surface pressure over the sea to rise.
As a result there will be a flow of air from sea to land - a sea breeze.

On average, sea breezes extend 8 to 14 NM either side of the coast and the speed is about 
10 kt. In the tropics speed is 15 kt or more and the inland extent is greater. 
The direction of the sea breeze is more or less at right angles to the coast, but after some time 
it will veer under the influence of the Coriolis Force.

Land breezes. From mid-afternoon the land is starting to cool and this process will accelerate 
after sunset.  Overnight the situation will reverse and pressure will now be higher on land than 
over the sea as the temperature reduces.  This will give rise to a wind now blowing from land 
to sea, the land breeze.  The land breeze can be expected within about 5 NM of the coastline 
and with a maximum speed of about 5 kt.

Winds
Valley or Ravine Winds 
A wind blowing against a mountain is impeded. If the barrier is broken by a gap or valley, the 
wind will blow along the valley at an increased speed due to the restriction. This is illustrated 
in Figure 10.27.
Figure 10.27 A valley or ravine wind
With a valley wind, if there is a relatively small change in the general direction, it is possible for 
the valley wind to reverse completely as shown in Figure 10.28. The combination of high wind 
speed and rough terrain is likely to give rise to considerable turbulence at low level, landing at 
airfields in such areas may be difficult.
Figure 10.28 Wind direction reversal in a valley or ravine
Examples of valley winds are the Mistral (Rhone Valley), (see Chapter 21) Genovese (Po Valley), 
Kosava (Danube) and Vardarac (Thessalonika). Valley winds also occur in fjords.

Winds
Venturi Effect
The increase in speed as the wind flows through a valley will cause the Venturi Effect with 
the consequent reduction in pressure which will result in the true altitude being less than the 
indicated altitude.  The same effect may be experienced above a mountain range as the wind 
blows over the range, particularly in stable conditions.
Katabatic Winds
A katabatic wind is caused by a flow of cold air down a hill or mountain side at night.
If the side of the mountain is cooled by radiation, the air in contact is also cooled, it will thus be 
denser and heavier than the surrounding air and it will therefore flow down the mountain side.
The katabatic effect is most marked if the mountain side is snow covered, if the sky is clear to 
assist radiation and if the PG is slack. Speeds average 10 kt and the flow of cold air into the 
valley helps frost and fog to form. Another effect is that with the sinking of cold air down the 
slope, the air at higher levels will be warmer and an inversion results. The katabatic effect can 
also occur by day when relatively warm air comes into contact with snow covered slopes. A 
katabatic wind is shown in Figure 10.29.
Figure 10.29 Katabatic wind formation
An example of a katabatic wind is the Bora in the Northern Adriatic (see Chapter 21).

Anabatic Winds
On a warm sunny day, the slope of a hill will become heated by insolation, particularly if it is a 
south facing slope.
The air in contact with the ground will be heated by conduction and will rise up the hill. Free 
cold air will replace the lifted air and so a light wind will blow up the hillside. An anabatic wind 
is a light wind of around 5 kt which blows up a hill or mountain by day as illustrated in Figure 
10.30.

Föhn Winds
The Föhn Wind is a warm dry wind which blows on the downwind side of a mountain range. 
It is a local wind in the Alps. A similar wind on the east of the Rocky Mountains in Canada is 
called the Chinook (see Chapter 21). There is also the Zonda to the east of the Andes in South 
America.
When moist air is forced to rise up a mountain in stable conditions it will cool adiabatically at 
the DALR until saturated when it will continue cooling at the SALR.  Precipitation will occur 
removing water from the air so the dew point will decrease.
When the air descends on the leeward (downwind) side the cloud base will be higher so the air 
will warm at the DALR over a greater height than it cooled at the SALR on the windward side. 
Consequently the temperature at the base of the mountain will be greater on the downwind 
side than it was on the upwind side.
So, on the windward side we can expect low cloud and precipitation whilst on the leeward side 
we will see clear turbulent conditions.

The result is a warm, dry wind blowing on the downside of the mountain. Temperature 
increases in excess of 10°C may occur.  The presence of a Föhn wind could also indicate the 
presence of mountain waves.
Föhn winds can occur over the east and west coasts of Scotland when moist winds come over 
the highlands off the Atlantic Ocean or North Sea.

Upper Winds
Introduction
Upper winds are caused by Pressure Gradient Force (PGF), Coriolis Force (CF) and Centrifugal 
Force in the same way as the wind immediately above the friction layer.
The winds tend to be stronger because the density is less -
V =
 PGF  
2 Ω ρ sin q
At 20 000 ft, for the same PGF, the wind speed is double the surface wind speed, since density 
is half that at the surface.
When flying at higher altitudes the altimeter is set to the standard pressure setting (1013 hPa) 
so if we are at an indicated altitude of, say, 18 000 ft we are actually flying at the 500 hPa 
pressure level.  Therefore the pressure at 18 000 ft (or any other altitude) is of little interest to 
us, but the true altitude of the pressure levels becomes important. 
Contour Charts - Constant Pressure Charts
A Constant Pressure or Contour Chart is a chart where the pressure is constant everywhere. 
For example, as shown in Figure 11.1 we can see that the 1000 hPa pressure level varies with 
height. These heights are plotted as contour lines (also known as isohypses) with the reference 
being MSL. The heights give us an indication of the distance that a pressure level is from MSL. If 
the contours are high values (in comparison to other values on the chart) then we can assume 
a high pressure exists. Conversely if the contours are lower values then we can assume a low 
pressure.
Figure 11.1

Upper Winds
These charts provide valuable information to us about how the pressure is changing over a 
distance. If the contours are closely spaced we can assume a high pressure gradient exists. If 
we can identify where the low pressure is we can then discover what the strength and direction 
of the resulting wind will be. Again we can use Buys Ballot’s Law so that with our back to the 
wind in the Northern Hemisphere the lower value contour is on the left, which is effectively a 
lower pressure. The upper winds will blow parallel to the contour lines (just like surface winds 
and isobars).
This wind speed is proportional to the distance between the contour lines. The wind that we 
find from this are for the height of the constant pressure chart, e.g. 500 hPa chart is about 
18 000 ft in ISA.

The heights shown on contour charts are heights AMSL.

Isotachs
Isotachs are lines joining places of equal wind speed (shown as red dashed lines on Figure 11.2).
Thermal Wind
The pressure changes that exist in the upper atmosphere that control our upper winds are 
directly related to the temperature differences between air masses. Figure 11.3 shows that the 
temperature difference between two air masses dictates the pressure we find in the upper 
atmosphere. Because the pressure differences that produce the upper winds are created by 
surface temperature differences, the upper winds are referred to as thermal winds.
Figure 11.3 Pressure changes at height in air masses of different temperature
Buys Ballot’s Law Revisited
In Figure 11.3, assuming we are in the Northern Hemisphere, then, from Buys Ballot’s law, the 
wind will be blowing into the diagram. Hence we can now modify Buys Ballot’s law:  If we stand 
with our back to the wind in the Northern Hemisphere then low pressure, low temperature or 
low altitude are on the left.  (And on the right in Southern Hemisphere).
We can deduce from this that upper winds will, generally be westerly in both hemispheres. 
The exceptions to this, and the reasons, will be discussed in jet streams and global climatology.
We can now extend Buys Ballot’s Law to cover upper winds.  We have seen that low surface 
temperatures lead to comparatively low pressure at altitude compared to high surface 
temperatures and this, therefore, gives low altitude for a specified pressure level over cold air 
and higher altitudes over warm air.

Jet Streams
As we go higher in the troposphere, the density decreases and the temperature effect 
overwhelms the surface pressure effect, hence winds veer or back to blow perpendicular to 
the surface temperature gradient as altitude increases which means that upper winds will 
generally be westerly in both hemispheres. The strongest winds are to be found just below the 
tropopause and where these winds exceed 60 kt they are termed jet streams. For examination 
purposes we assume a jet stream to be about 2000 miles long, 200 miles wide and 2 miles 
deep. This gives a width to length ratio of 1:10, a depth to width ratio of 1:100 and a depth to 
length ratio of 1:1000.  Speeds of in excess 300 kt have been recorded though these are rare.
Figure 11.4 Typical jet stream dimensions
Causes
Jet streams are caused by large surface temperature differences, i.e. large thermal components.
Locations
There are two main locations:
•	 Subtropical jet streams form in the area of the subtropical anticyclones. They are more or 
less permanent but move seasonally with the subtropical highs. In the Northern Hemisphere 
they occur in the latitude bands 25° to 40° in winter and 40° to 45° in summer, in the 
Southern Hemisphere they occur between about 25° and 30°. The jet core is at the 200 hPa 
level.

Figure 11.6 Subtropical jet streams
•	 Polar front jetstreams are associated with the polar front depressions and usually lie parallel 
to the surface position of the warm and cold fronts.  They are found between about 40°N 
and 65°N in the Northern Hemisphere and around 50°S to 55°S in the Southern Hemisphere.
•	 Polar Night Jets occur in higher middle latitudes in mid-winter near the top of the 
stratosphere (50 hPa level). Direction is westerly and speeds average 150 kt. Speeds of 
350 kt have been noted.
•	 Tropical Easterly Jet (Equatorial Easterly Jet). Strong easterlies that occur in the Northern 
Hemisphere’s summer between 10° and 20° North, where the contrast between intensely 
heated central Asian plateau and the sea further south is greatest. It runs from South China 
Sea westwards across southern India, Ethiopia and the sub Sahara. Typically heights circa 
100 hPa (16 km; 50 000 ft).
•	 Arctic Jet stream found between the boundary of Arctic air and polar air. Typically in winter 
at around 60° North but in the USA around 45° to 50° North. The core is at approximately 
20 000 ft (400 hPa). It is a transient feature found over North America and Northern Eurasia 
during Arctic air outbreaks.

Note: This general disposition of winds will move some 15° south in January and some 15° north 
in July.
•	 Local jets may arise due to local thermal or dynamic circumstances e.g. the Somali, or 
Findlater jet off East Africa.
•	 Other jets. ‘Jets’ as opposed to jet streams may exist as narrow, fast currents of air at low 
level.
Direction and Speed
The direction of jet streams is generally westerly, maximum speeds occur near the tropopause, 
200 kt have been recorded in Europe/N Atlantic and 300 kt in Southeast Asia.
Clear Air Turbulence (TURB)
Clear air turbulence (TURB) occurs around the boundaries of jet streams because of the large 
horizontal and vertical windshears.
It is strongest near to, or just below, the jet axis on the cold air (low pressure) side with a 
secondary area above the axis.
Movement
As with most other weather phenomena, jet streams move with the sun.
Subtropical jets, based on Hadley cells, will move north in the northern summer as the heat 
equator moves north and then south in the northern winter.
Polar front jets in the Northern Hemisphere will move north (and decrease in speed) as the 
polar front moves north in summer. During the winter the polar front moves south and because 
of the greater temperature difference, the speed will increase.

Recognition
•	 From the ground, when the cloud amounts 
allow, jets may be recognized by wind 
blown wisps of CIRRUS cloud blowing at 
right angles to the clouds at lower levels.
•	 In the air, the presence of a jet will be 
difficult to see, but temperature differences, 
increases in wind speed, drift and clear air 
turbulence are all evidence of jet streams.
•	 On charts, jets may be picked out quite 
easily by inspection of upper wind Charts 
and more graphically perhaps by looking at 
a Significant Weather Chart.

Forecasting
The forecasting of jet streams is largely a matter of producing charts from upper air soundings 
by radiosonde. Thickness charts were mentioned earlier as a means of establishing thermal 
wind patterns, but for forecasting, meteorologists use contour charts.
In-flight reports of temperature and wind velocities are a useful confirmation of upper air 
soundings and over oceans (and deserts) are vital supplements.

Clouds
Introduction
Clouds may be regarded as signposts in the sky giving us warning of what the weather is or 
what it is likely to be.  They are also a source of several hazards to aviation:
•	 Turbulence
•	 Poor visibility
•	 Precipitation
•	 Icing
•	 Lightning
In view of this it is essential that pilots must be able to recognize the different types of clouds 
and identify the hazards associated with the clouds. A summary of the properties and hazards 
associated with the different types of cloud appears at the end of this chapter.
Cloud Amount
Cloud amounts are reported in OKTAS (eighths). It is assumed that the sky is divided into 8 
equal parts and the total cloud amount is reported by an assessment of the number of eighths 
of the sky covered by cloud.

Cloud Base
“That lowest zone in which the type of obscuration perceptibly changes from that corresponding 
to clear air haze to that corresponding to water droplets or ice crystals.” The cloud base is the 
height of the base of the cloud above ground - above official aerodrome level.
Cloud Ceiling
“The height above aerodrome level of the lowest layer of cloud of more than 4 oktas”. (Cloud 
ceiling is also referred to as main cloud base).
Measurement of Cloud Base
•	 By day a balloon with a known rate of 
ascent is released and the time between 
release and the disappearance of the 
balloon into cloud is noted. From this cloud 
base can be calculated.

with a known rate of ascent

Clouds
•	 By night, an alidade is positioned a known distance from a searchlight and is used to measure 
the angle above the horizontal of the searchlight glow on the base of the cloud. The height 
of the cloud base is then calculated by trigonometry.
Figure 12.2 Finding the height of the cloud base using an alidade
The Cloud Base Recorder
A cloud base recorder or ceilometer is a device that uses a laser or other light source to 
determine the height of a cloud base. There are several types of ceilometers depending on 
whether a normal light source or a laser light source is used.
•	 The first type of ceilometer uses a normal light source. There a several versions of such 
ceilometers. The optical drum ceilometer consists essentially of a projector, a detector, and 
a recorder. The projector emits an intense beam of light into the sky. The detector, located 
at a fixed distance from the projector, uses a photoelectric cell to detect the projected light 
when it is reflected from clouds. In the fixed-beam ceilometer, the light is beamed vertically 
into the sky by the projector and the detector is aligned at various angles to intercept the 
reflected light; in the rotating-beam ceilometer, the detector is positioned vertically and 
the light projected at various angles. In either case, trigonometry is used to determine the 
altitude of the clouds reflecting the light from a knowledge of the angle at which the light 
is detected and the distance between the projector and detector. The recorder is calibrated 
to indicate cloud height directly.

Figure 12.3 A laser ceilometer
•	 A laser ceilometer consists of a vertically pointing laser and a receiver house in the same 
instrument assembly, as shown above. It determines the height by measuring the time 
required for a pulse of light to be scattered back from the cloud base. The laser ceilometer is 
more accurate and more reliable than the other types of recorders and as such it is the main 
type of recorder currently in use.
Measurement of Cloud Tops
The height of cloud tops cannot be easily measured.  The forecasters can deduce the height 
from the ELR and SALR but this is not very accurate and the forecasters rely on pilot reports of 
cloud top height to assist with the forecasting.

Cloud Movement
Meteorological 
stations 
measure 
the 
movement of clouds by means of a 
nephoscope. This measures the angular speed 
of movement of cloud and if the base height 
is known, the speed of movement may be 
calculated. A Besson nephoscope is shown on 
the right.
Cloud Classification
Classification of cloud type is based, primarily, 
on the shape, or form of the cloud. The basic 
forms of cloud are stratiform, cumuliform and 
cirriform. 
Stratiform cloud is a layered type of cloud 
of considerable horizontal extent, but little 
vertical extent. (See Figure 12.5.)
Figure 12.5 Stratiform cloud
Cumuliform cloud is heaped cloud, displaying a marked vertical extent, of greater or lesser 
degree.
Cirriform cloud is a cloud which is fibrous, wispy or hair-like in appearance. This type of cloud is 
found only at high levels in the troposphere.
Clouds are also identified by reference to the height at which they occur. There are 3 distinct 
cloud levels within the troposphere.

•	 Low-level clouds These clouds may be 
stratus, 
stratocumulus, 
cumulus 
and 
cumulonimbus. (The prefix nimbo and 
the suffix nimbus imply “rain bearing”.) 
However, cumulus and cumulonimbus will 
have significant vertical development and 
will extend from low-level to higher levels. 
Cumulonimbus clouds may extend into the 
lower stratosphere.
•	 Medium-level clouds are found between 
6500 ft and 23 000 ft. The names of 
medium-level clouds are characterized by 
the prefix “alto-”: such as altostratus and 
altocumulus. Nimbostratus is also classified 
as a medium level cloud. 
•	 High-level clouds The names of high-level 
clouds are prefixed by “cirro-”: cirrostratus, 
cirrocumulus, and cirrus. (Latin cirrus means 
curl.)

Clouds
Stratus (St or ST)
Stratus (from Latin stratum, meaning strewn) is generally a grey, layered cloud with a fairly 
uniform base, which may produce drizzle, or light snow. The vertical extent of stratus cloud 
may be from a few hundred feet up to several thousand feet. Stratus is usually the lowest of all 
cloud types. The main hazard associated with stratus is poor visibility and it often covers high 
ground, concealing hill tops from pilots and producing hill fog for hikers. When stratus is at its 
thinnest, the sun can be clearly seen through the stratus layer. 
Stratocumulus (Sc or SC)
Stratocumulus cloud is probably the most common form of cloud in the skies of the United 
Kingdom. It appears grey, or whitish, but usually has distinct dark parts. Stratocumulus can be 
seen as patches, or in a continuous layer. Stratocumulus is usually no more than 2000 to 3000 
ft thick, but may become 5000 to 6000 ft deep in certain conditions. Usually the cloud base is 
between 1000 ft and 4500 ft.

Clouds
Nimbostratus (Ns or NS)
Nimbostratus is a dense, dark-grey, rain-bearing, stratiform cloud, producing extensive and 
long-lasting continuous or intermittent precipitation. Usually the cloud base is between the 
surface and 6500 ft above ground level. NS is generally found at the warm front in polar front 
depressions.
Figure 12.10 Nimbostratus
Cumulus (Cu or CU)
Cumulus cloud is the most common form of convective cloud, being classified as heaped cloud, 
from Latin cumulare meaning to heap up. For glider pilots, a developing cumulus is regarded 
as a reliable indication of the presence of thermal upcurrents which, if skilfully exploited, can 
enable the glider to gain height. Pilots of light aircraft, on the other hand, will note that, on a 
day when the sky is peppered with fine-weather cumulus flight below cloud base is turbulent, 
whereas, above the cloud tops, the air is likely to be very smooth. 
A developed cumulus cloud is generally dense, with sharp outlines. As it continues to develop 
vertically, a cumulus cloud forms mounds, domes or towers, of which the upper parts often

Clouds
resemble the head of a cauliflower. The sunlit parts of cumulus clouds are brilliant white, but 
their bases are relatively dark. 
Cumulus clouds of small vertical development can appear benign, but they can grow 
rapidly, when the atmosphere is unstable, with no upper-air inversion, and may develop into 
cumulonimbus clouds, with their tops reaching the tropopause. Usually the cloud base is 
between 1000 ft and 5000 ft but this increases as the surface temperature increases.
Cumulonimbus (Cb or CB)
Cumulonimbus clouds are clouds that the aviator should avoid. Cumulonimbus clouds consist 
of vigorous convective cloud cells of great vertical extent. The upper parts of a cumulonimbus 
cloud consist of supercooled water droplets and ice crystals. The base of cumulonimbus clouds 
is often very dark, with ragged cloud appearing beneath the main cloud cell. Usually the cloud 
base is between 2000 ft and 5000 ft.
The risk of icing and turbulence associated with cumulonimbus is moderate to severe. Within 
cumulonimbus, very strong upcurrents and downdraughts are continually at play, producing 
severe precipitation in the form of showers of rain and hail. Other hazards associated with 
cumulonimbus are lightning and static discharge, which may lead to airframe damage, 
erroneous instrument readings and squally winds.
Moist unstable air throughout a deep layer of the atmosphere is necessary for the formation 
of cumulonimbus cloud. A trigger mechanism is also required to kick off the convection process 
associated with isolated, heat-type cumulonimbus.

Clouds
Altocumulus (Ac or AC)
Altocumulus takes the form of speckled white 
or grey cloud. The patches of cloud appear as 
rounded masses of fibrous or diffuse aspect.
There are two forms of altocumulus which are 
of particular significance, namely: altocumulus 
lenticularis and altocumulus castellanus.
Altocumulus lenticularis, also known as 
lenticular cloud, is found downwind of 
mountainous or hilly areas, and is indicative 
of the presence of mountain wave activity. 
Because of its position downwind of high 
ground, moderate or even severe turbulence 
may be associated with the presence of 
altocumulus lenticularis. However, the air in the lenticular clouds, themselves, is always smooth.
Figure 12.14 Altocumulus Lenticularis.
Figure 12.15 Altocumulus Castellanus.
 
Altocumulus castellanus is a “bubbly” form of normal altocumulus. The “towers” that form 
in altocumulus castellanus are like battlements on castles, hence the name. These clouds are 
significant because they often herald a change to showery, thundery weather and are a feature 
of summer weather in temperate latitudes. 
Cumulonimbus clouds sometimes develop from altocumulus castellanus, when instability is 
present at medium levels of the troposphere.

Clouds
Altostratus (As or AS)
Altostratus is a grey or bluish sheet, or layer 
of cloud, which can be fibrous or uniform in 
appearance. Sometimes, altostratus covers 
the whole sky, giving a “ground glass” effect 
around the sun or moon. 
Altostratus can be from around 2000 ft to 
8000 ft thick. But despite its thickness, 
altostratus is not a dense cloud, and the sun 
is usually perceptible through the cloud layer.
Cirrus (Ci or CI)
Cirrus (from Latin cirrus, meaning curl) is the highest of all the cloud types and is composed 
entirely of ice crystals. Cirrus clouds take the form of white delicate filaments, in patches or 
narrow bands. They may also be described as fibrous or hair-like. They often herald the approach 
of a warm front.

Clouds
Cirrostratus (Cs or CS)
Cirrostratus is a transparent, whitish cloud-veil 
of fibrous or smooth appearance, totally or 
partially covering the sky. 
Cirrostratus is made up of ice crystals, and the 
presence of CS usually indicates the approach 
of a warm front.  In tropical regions CS is 
often associated with the presence of tropical 
revolving storms.  CS often produces a halo 
around the sun or the moon. 
Cirrocumulus (Cc or CC)
Cirrocumulus is probably the cloud which is 
least often seen in the sky. Cirrocumulus is a 
thin, white and patchy layer of cloud, with 
ripples, more or less regularly arranged. 
Cirrocumulus consists of ice crystals.

Clouds
Notes:
* Orographic uplift can give moderate/severe turbulence and icing in Sc
** Stratus Fractus (St Fra) the ragged cloud found in the precipitation below Ns, caused by the 
evaporation of the water droplets saturating the air and low level turbulence leading to the 
formation of the cloud.
***Stages of Cumulus Development:
Cumulus Fractus (Cu Fra) small ragged cloud usually forming in the early morning, may also be 
found in the precipitation zone below Cb
Cumulus Humilis (Cu Hum) also known as Fair Weather Cu, small Cu, the next stage of 
development usually seen early in the morning
Cumulus Mediocris (Cu Med) larger cumulus, distinguished by light upper areas having a 
cauliflower appearance but very dark underneath (moderate vertical development)
Cumulus Congestus (Cu Con) also known as Towering Cumulus (TCU) (strong vertical 
development)
Cumulonimbus Calvus (Cu Cal) The tops are now rounded but do not have a fibrous appearance 
and there is no anvil
Cumulonimbus Capillatis (Cb Cap) any Cb having an anvil
Note: By convention, a cumulus cloud is reported as cumulonimbus if accompanied by 
lightning, thunder, hail or any other precipitation of a showery nature.

Cloud Formation and Precipitation
Vertical Motion
Cloud is formed by air being lifted and cooled adiabatically until the water vapour condenses 
out as water droplets. The height at which this occurs is called the condensation level. It is also 
the height of the cloud base.
The means whereby the initial lifting of the air occurs are as follows:
•	 Turbulence.
•	 Orographic Uplift.
•	 Convection.
•	 Slow, widespread ascent (frontal uplift).
•	 Convergence.
Note:	 The lifting processes above are strictly all ‘convection’; the third process is free 
convection, the rest are forced convection.
Condensation Level
The condensation level is the height at which the rising air, cooling adiabatically, has cooled to 
the dew point temperature.  Any further ascent and cooling will result in condensation and the 
formation of cloud.  This will be the height of the base of the cloud.
Figure 13.1 Condensation level
Turbulence Cloud
In stable conditions the vertical movement of air is limited and hence the upcurrents created 
by the surface friction are limited as to the height they can reach.  If the rising air reaches dew 
point before it reaches the top of the friction layer then cloud will form, but since vertical 
development is restricted the cloud will tend to develop horizontally giving layers of ST/SC. 
Because ST and SC are formed in these conditions they are known as turbulence cloud.  There 
will normally be an inversion above turbulence cloud.

Cloud Formation and Precipitation
Orographic Cloud
Air meeting a ridge of high ground will be forced to rise. If the air is sufficiently humid the 
condensation level will appear below the crest of the ridge & cloud will form.
If the air is stable and precipitation occurs, the 
air will descend on the LEE side and the cloud 
base will be higher than on the windward 
side and this will generate warmer surface 
temperature - the Föhn effect.
If the air is dryer, then the cloud base will be 
above the ridge and lenticular cloud would 
result.
Lifting in unstable conditions can produce Cu 
or Cb clouds and also thunderstorms if there is 
enough water vapour present.
Strong winds with moist air can cause 
convective 
instability 
and 
Cb 
and 
thunderstorms. The Cb can be embedded in 
other cloud types, eg frontal or Turbulence 
cloud.

Figure 13.5 Temperature/height diagram
Convection Cloud
Critical Temperature. Before dealing with the formation of convection cloud we must consider 
the critical, or convective temperature. Figure 13.6 shows air rising and cooling at the DALR 
at 0700, 0800 & 0900 hrs. The first two ascents result in the air cooling to the environmental 
temperature before it reaches dew point.  At 0900 the air cools to dew point, cloud forms and 
the ELR allows the air to continue rising, cooling at the SALR and forming Cu type cloud.

Cloud Formation and Precipitation
There are two particular cases:
•	 fair weather Cu, which often forms early in the morning,
•	 large Cu/Cb, which often occur later in the day.
Figure 13.7 The formation of convection cloud
Convection cloud is heap type, Cu or Cb. It is isolated, often forming over a place, then being 
blown away by the wind and further clouds forming over the same place.
The surface air temperature required for the air to be lifted to the condensation level and for 
cloud to form is called the critical temperature.
The cloud base will vary due to the varying temperatures on the ground surfaces. Cloud tops, 
however, are usually limited by mixing with and evaporating into a drier environment. The tops 
are then lower than the limit of uplift.
If there is turbulence with the convection, then Sc can form, the Cu being spread out to form 
the layer cloud.
Pure convection cloud cannot form over the sea but where there is cold air moving over a warm 
surface the air will become unstable and convection type cloud can form. This movement is 
called advection.
Convection cloud formed over land by surface heating soon dissipates at night because 
insolation stops and the cloud droplets evaporate.
Convective cloud may progress through various cumulus types from humilis, to mediocris, 
through congestus to calvus. A fully developed Cb may appear as cumulonimbus capillatus.

Cloud Formation and Precipitation
Widespread Ascent (Frontal Uplift)
At a front there is widespread lifting of air as warm air comes into contact with colder air. Layer 
type clouds form in the stable air at a warm front and heap clouds in the unstable air at a cold 
front.
Figure 13.8 The formation of frontal cloud
Convergence Cloud
When there is low pressure there is always 
convergence at the surface which leads to air 
being lifted. Thus in depressions and troughs, 
where there are no actual fronts, cloud 
formation occurs. See Figure 13.9.
With strong convergence at a trough, lifting can 
cause instability to develop so that the cloud 
type is Cu or Cb with possible thunderstorms.
This is particularly the case when saturation 
occurs early, with an average or high ELR.
Note: With circular isobars at a non-frontal 
low, normally only St/Sc cloud will be formed 
by convergence.

Mountainous Areas 
We have seen how orographic lifting produces cloud; in mountainous areas this may be very 
active and produce extensive cloud and vertical development due to Convective Instability. 
Additionally, this may increase the intensity of precipitation.

Cloud Formation and Precipitation
Inversions
An 
inversion 
in 
the 
atmosphere 
is 
where 
temperature rises with an 
increase 
in 
height. 
This 
produces extreme stability 
and must inhibit the formation 
of cloud. An inversion always 
exists above turbulence cloud 
and inversions have a similar 
effect at ANY altitude.
Precipitation
Clouds 
consist 
of 
water 
droplets averaging 0.02 mm 
in diameter and the rate of 
fall is negligible. By colliding 
with other droplets they may 
increase in size until they are 
too heavy to be supported 
by the upcurrents in the 
cloud and they drop out as 
precipitation.
There are currently two theories governing the formation of these precipitation drops.

Cloud Formation and Precipitation
Bergeron Theory
The Bergeron theory presumes that at high levels in the cloud, some of the water droplets will 
turn to ice and will grow in size by sublimation of water vapour and collision with supercooled 
water droplets. The frozen droplets will be much heavier than the existing water droplets 
and drop out at the bottom of the cloud, either as snow or raindrops, depending on the 
temperature.
Coalescence Theory
It is difficult to see how the above can account for summer precipitation where the whole of 
the cloud is at a temperature above zero and the coalescence theory may provide a better 
answer. This assumes the presence of a range of droplet sizes, the larger falling faster and 
uniting with the smaller until eventually the overweight drop falls out as drizzle or rain.

Thunderstorms
Conditions
Thunderstorms (TS) occur in well developed cumulonimbus (Cb) cloud, though not all Cbs 
produce thunderstorms. They are most likely to occur when there is:
•	 A lapse rate greater than the SALR through a layer at least 10 000’ thick and extending 
above the freezing level.
•	 Sufficient water vapour to form and maintain the cloud.
•	 Trigger * action to produce early saturation, thus enhancing instability.
* The so-called triggers or lifting forces are:
•	 Convection
•	 Orographic uplift
•	 Convergence
•	 Frontal uplift
Thunderstorms are classified as:
•	 Air mass type (more common in summer time).
•	 Frontal type (more common in winter time).
Air Mass Type Thunderstorms
Air mass type thunderstorms are:
•	 isolated - all triggers except frontal. 
•	 most frequent over land in summer.
•	 usually formed by day, clear by night.
•	 formed in cols or weak lows.
Note Thunderstorms formed by advection can occur day or night, over land or sea or at any 
time of the year.
Frontal Type Thunderstorms
Frontal thunderstorms are:
•	 most frequent in winter.
•	 formed over land or sea, day or night.
•	 usually formed in a line at a cold front or occlusion.
•	 found in active depressions or troughs.
•	 often accompanied by a line squall.
•	 the fastest moving.

Thunderstorms
Thunderstorm Development (Single Cell)
•	 Initial stage. Several small 
Cu combine to form a 
large Cu cell about 5 NM 
across. There are strong 
upcurrents of 1000 to 
2000 fpm (exceptionally 
6000 fpm). Air from the 
sides and below is drawn 
in to replace the lifted air, 
thus causing turbulence. 
The initial stage lasts about 
15 to 20 minutes.
•	 Mature 
stage. 
When 
precipitation occurs, the 
storm has reached the 
mature stage. The rain 
or hail will cause strong 
down currents of up to 
2400 fpm and will also 
bring cold air to lower 
levels. These down drafts 
will warm initially at the 
SALR causing the air to 
warm very slowly, thereby 
staying colder than the 
surrounding air causing 
it to sink faster. Another 
factor aiding these down 
drafts is that some of the 
rain will evaporate which 
will absorb latent heat 
from the air making it even colder and more dense. The intensity of this can lead to the 
formation of the GUST FRONT.
	
Up currents remain strong and can be up to 10 000 fpm. Tops may rise at 5000 fpm or more. 
There can be moderate to severe turbulence in, under, over and all around the cloud.
At the bottom leading edge of the storm there can be a roll of Sc and a strong gust front can 
be experienced up to 13 to 17 NM (24 to 32 km) ahead of the storm and be up to 6000 feet 
in depth. Below the cloud a squall and associated windshear can be expected.
Downbursts (microbursts or macrobursts) may occur at this stage.  These are discussed 
later in this chapter.

Thunderstorms
Rising and falling water droplets will produce a considerable build-up of static electricity, 
usually of positive charge at the top of the cloud and negative at the bottom. The build-ups 
eventually lead to lightning discharge and thunder.
A characteristic of the mature stage is the GUST FRONT in advance of the storm produced 
by the force of the descending air. The gust front may extend 13 to 17 NM (24 to 32 km) 
ahead of the storm centre.
The mature stage lasts for a further 15 to 20 min.
Figure 14.3 Electrostatic charge on a thundercloud

•	 Dissipating stage. At this stage there is precipitation, which is heavy, and extreme 
turbulence. Thunder and lightning may possibly occur at this stage.

Thunderstorms
Figure 14.5 The dissipating stage of thunderstorm development
The cloud extends to the tropopause, where it is spread out by the upper wind to form an 
anvil. At these levels the cloud thins to form Ci.
Large variations in static charge in and around the cloud cause discharge in the form of 
lightning which can appear in the cloud, from the cloud to the ground, or from the cloud 
to the air alongside.
The dissipating stage lasts for a further 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Movement of Thunderstorms
Single cell thunderstorms usually move in the direction of the 10 000 ft (700 hPa) wind, though 
large storms and newly developed ones may differ from this.

Forecasting
Forecasting the occurrence of thunderstorms will be largely a matter of assembling the 
conditions necessary for the formation and the triggers. A combination of these two groups 
will indicate the probability of thunderstorms. Satellite photography and computer modelling 
are used to predict this occurrence.

Supercell Thunderstorms (Severe Local Storms)
•	 Initial Stage
Conditions necessary to initiate these thunderstorms are:
•	 Great depth of instability
•	 Strong vertical windshear
•	 Stable layer between warm (lower) and cool (upper) air which is eventually broken down 
by insolation.
Figure 14.7 Conditions for supercell thunderstorm
•	 Mature Stage
Characteristics of the mature stage are:
•	
Very strong up and downdraughts produced in the one large (super) cell give rise to 
violent weather and even tornadoes (an average of 33 tornadoes per year have occurred 
in Britain over recent years reminding us that they are not a phenomena restricted to the 
USA.)
•	 The mature stage may last several hours.
•	 Movement
In the Northern Hemisphere movement is usually about 20° to the right of the 18 000 ft 
(500 hPa) W/V.
•	 Location
Supercell thunderstorms are more common over continental land masses than over maritime 
areas. Thunderstorms over the mid-west states of the USA producing tornadoes are good 
examples.

Avoidance
The CAA has produced recommended avoidance distances when using weather radar. These 
are shown below in Figure 14.8. It should be noted that the significance of a radar return of 
given intensity usually increases with altitude. The principle underlying use of airborne weather 
radar is that strong up currents (which will support strong turbulence) will support large water 
droplets, which will show a stronger radar return. The diagram at Figure 14.8 shows a display 
that can be found on a typical /generic EFIS display.

Radar
Airborne Weather Radar (CCWR) is Plan Position Indicator (PPI) radar, but ground radar, 
though mostly PPI, may also use RHI (range-height indicator). CCWR is explained elsewhere in 
this course, but Figure 14.9 shows how returns from many radars are combined to produce an 
area display which will be multicoloured to identify different precipitation intensities.
A Stormscope is a highly sophisticated system that detects, locates and maps areas of electrical 
discharge activity contained within thunderstorms permitting avoidance of the associated 
hazards.

Summary of Thunderstorm Hazards
•	 Turbulence. Turbulence can be violent both within cloud and at their sides. Below the cloud, 
turbulence can be dangerous during take-off and landing and there can be windshear. It is 
possible for a pilot to overstress the airframe in these conditions.
Loose articles being thrown about inside the aircraft cabin can injure passengers. Pressure 
instruments can be in error due to lag.
Figure 14.10 Thunderstorm Hazards
•	 Hail. Hail can be met at any height in the cloud, also below the cloud and below the anvil. 
Severe skin damage to the airframe can occur when the hail is large. Damaging hail can 
occur up to a height of 45 000 feet.
Figure 14.11

•	 Icing. This can occur at all heights in the cloud where the temperature is between 0°C and 
-45°C. Heavy concentrations of droplets and large droplet size result in severe clear icing.
Carburettor icing can occur at temperatures between -10°C and +30°C and it can be 
particularly severe between -2°C and +15°C.

•	 Lightning. Lightning is most likely to occur within about 5000 ft of the freezing level. 
Temperature between +10°C and -10°C. The main effects of a lightning strike are:
•	 Temporary blindness of the pilots
•	 Minor airframe damage
•	 Magnetic compasses may be seriously affected (errors of 10s of degrees have been 
recorded) and their information should be used with caution until they can be checked
•	 Disruption to electrical equipment
Figure 14.13 Lightning

Thunderstorms
•	 Static. This causes interference on radio equipment in the LF, MF, HF and VHF frequencies. 
St Elmo’s fire can be caused by static and it results in purple rings of light around the nose, 
wing tips and propellers.
This is not a hazard, but it indicates that the air is electrically charged and lightning is 
probable.
•	 Pressure variations. Local pressure variations covering only a very small region, in or close 
to, a storm can occur causing QFE/QNH to be in error, so that altimeter readings can be 
inaccurate by as much as ±1000’ at all heights. These, together with gust effects, can cause 
height errors at low level which can be dangerous.

VSIs will also be subject to errors. The aircraft should be flown for ATTITUDE rather than 
altitude, though some attitude indicators may not be able to cope with the changes of 
attitude produced by the severe turbulence likely to be encountered.
•	 Microbursts. These are down currents in the cloud which also move outwards by reaction 
from the ground, having speeds considerably in excess of 1000 feet per minute downwards 
(up to 6000 fpm) and 50 kt horizontally. The windshear (headwind to tailwind) may be

Thunderstorms
between 50 & 90 kt. They are largely caused by descending raindrops which cool the 
surrounding air by evaporation, the higher density accelerating the downdraught still 
further.
Figure 14.15 Microbursts
They are concentrated in a burst which is up to 4 km in horizontal length and have a lifetime 
of less than 5 minutes. (A macroburst is a similar event but over a bigger area.)
Microbursts are most likely to occur in summer air mass thunderstorms in low latitude regions 
where surface conditions are dry. They cause extreme turbulence and severe windshear 
conditions.
A warning sign is virga, which is streaks of precipitation from below the cloud which do not 
reach the ground.
•	 Water ingestion. If updraught speed approaches or exceeds the terminal velocity of the 
falling raindrops, the resulting high concentrations of water can exceed the design limits for 
water ingestion in some turbine engines. The result can be engine flame-out and/or engine 
structural failure. Water ingestion may also affect pitot heads, even though heaters have 
been switched on.
•	 Tornadoes. Tornadoes are exclusively associated with CB and large CU clouds.  They usually 
occur as a result of vertical windshear with warm moist air at low altitude and cool dry air 
coming from a different direction at high altitude.  They are very powerful whirlwinds with 
small horizontal extent and very low pressure in the centre.
The highest incidence is in the southern states of the USA (tornado alley) in the spring and 
early summer when very warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, moving north, meets relatively 
cold air coming from the northwest.  This gives massive instability and the windshear 
required.  These tornadoes may have rotational speeds in excess of 200 kt and diameters 
up to 1 km.

Thunderstorms
Fortunately in Europe we do not have such volatile conditions.  Typically the maximum 
diameter of a tornado will be 100 to 150 m, but most are considerably smaller than this. 
They are most likely to be associated with air mass thunderstorms in the summer months 
and usually occur in the afternoon.  When they occur over the sea they appear as water 
spouts
The Fujita Scale
Dr. Fujita of the University of Chicago has devised a scale based on the damage caused by the 
tornadoes.  It should be noted that the scale is based on the observed damage so different 
construction standards may result in erroneous assessment of speed.

Dust devils are small whirlwinds usually occurring on hot and sunny afternoons when strong 
convective currents interact.  In dry conditions they will draw up dust off the ground, hence 
the name.  Whilst wind speeds may exceed gale force they have small diameter and will only 
extend up to a maximum height of around 2000 ft.  As with tornadoes dust devils will be 
hazardous to aircraft and should be avoided.

Introduction
1.1 	
This Circular has been produced to provide an understanding of the hazard that 
thunderstorms and their associated effects can pose to all aircraft operations and replaces the 
guidance previously published in AIC P 019/2010. It has been published for the information and 
safety of all pilots.
1.2	
 This Circular has been written with two-pilot operation of larger aircraft in mind; 
however, text that has been highlighted by the use of capital letters is of particular relevance 
to pilots of all aircraft.
1.3 	
The overarching advice in this Circular is that flight through thunderstorms should be 
avoided.
2	
 Thunderstorm Warnings
2.1	
Meteorological Watch Offices (MWO) issue SIGMET (Significant Meteorology) warnings 
of ‘Thunderstorms’ when significant cumulonimbus clouds likely to produce thunderstorms are 
forecast and when these thunderstorms are expected to be difficult to detect visually by a pilot. 
They could be obscured (OBSC TS), embedded in other clouds (EMBD TS) and could possibly 
be frequent (FRQ TS) or organised along a line (SQL TS). These warnings include information 
on the location, movement and development of the thunderstorm areas. As it is expected 
that all pilots will be aware of the additional phenomena associated with thunderstorms, ie 
hail, severe icing, and severe turbulence (as expanded on in the Annex to this Circular), these 
forecast details will not be included in the SIGMET text, although heavy hail (HVYGR) could be 
included. In addition, aircraft commanders are required to send a Special Aircraft Observation 
when conditions are encountered likely to affect the safety of aircraft. Such a report could 
then trigger a SIGMET warning. MWOs do not issue SIGMET warnings in relation to isolated or 
scattered thunderstorms not embedded in cloud layers or concealed by haze (unless prompted 
by a Special Aircraft Observation). It should therefore be noted that the absence of a SIGMET 
warning does not necessarily indicate the absence of thunderstorms.

Thunderstorms
2.2	
Aerodrome Warnings are issued by the Meteorological Office for terminal area 
operations where there is a forecast likelihood of thunderstorms in the immediate vicinity of 
an aerodrome. Separate windshear warnings may be issued at some aerodromes (notably 
London Heathrow and Belfast Aldergrove) where a nearby thunderstorm is the criteria for a 
windshear warning. Elsewhere, the proximity of a thunderstorm will not necessarily result in 
such a warning, but the probability of windshear is no less. In relation to windshear hazards at 
low-level your attention is drawn to AIC 84/2008 (Pink 150) - ‘Low Altitude Windshear’.
2.3 	
Details of the criteria for Special Aircraft Observations and the SIGMET service are 
given in the UK Aeronautical Information Publication at GEN 3.5 paragraph 6.2 and GEN 3.5 
paragraph 8 respectively.
3 	
Procedures and Flying Techniques
3.1 	
Notwithstanding the advice that follows, gathered from research and operational 
experience, the first and most basic advice for all pilots is: 
Do not treat thunderstorms lightly and whenever possible AVOID them.
3.2 	
Thunderstorms should be avoided either visually, by the use of radar, or by other 
methods. If this cannot be achieved, and in the absence of specific aircraft flight manual or 
operations manual guidance, the following procedures and techniques are recommended.
a. If it is found necessary to penetrate an area of cloud which may contain cumulonimbus 
clouds:
i. ENSURE THAT CREW MEMBERS’ SAFETY BELTS OR HARNESSES ARE FIRMLY FASTENED 
AND SECURE ANY LOOSE ARTICLES BEFOREHAND. Switch on the seat belt notices and 
make sure that all passengers are securely strapped in and that loose equipment (eg cabin 
trolleys and galley containers) are firmly secured. Pilots should remember that turbulence 
is normally worse in the rear of an aircraft than on the flight deck.
ii. One pilot should control the aircraft with the other continually monitoring all the flight 
instruments.
iii. SELECT AN ALTITUDE FOR PENETRATION, BEARING IN MIND THE IMPORTANCE OF 
ENSURING ADEQUATE TERRAIN CLEARANCE IN LIKELY DOWNDRAUGHTS. Investigations 
have shown that although in some thunderstorms there is very little turbulence at the 
lower levels, in others there is a great deal; altitude is not necessarily a guide to the 
degree of turbulence. Increasing height will decrease the buffet margin and up-currents 
may force the aircraft into buffet owing to an increased angle of attack.
iv. SET THE POWER TO GIVE THE RECOMMENDED SPEED FOR FLIGHT IN TURBULENCE, 
ADJUST THE TRIM AND NOTE ITS POSITION SO THAT ANY EXCESSIVE CHANGES DUE TO 
AUTOPILOT OR MACH TRIM OPERATION CAN BE QUICKLY ASSESSED. Turbulence speeds 
quoted in flight or operations manuals provide a single speed or a speed bracket.
v. CHECK ALL FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS AND ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES.
vi. ENSURE THAT THE PITOT HEATERS ARE SWITCHED ON.
vii. CHECK THE OPERATION OF ALL ANTI-ICING AND DE-ICING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATE 
ALL THESE SYSTEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURER’S OR OPERATOR’S 
INSTRUCTIONS. The operation of leading edge, expanding boot type de-icers should be
--- Page 258 ---
Thunderstorms
14
252
14
Thunderstorms
delayed until some ice has formed, otherwise their effectiveness will be greatly reduced. 
IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS, ENSURE THAT ALL ANTI-ICING SYSTEMS, 
INCLUDING WINDSCREEN HEATERS, ARE ON.
viii. DISREGARD ANY RADIO NAVIGATION INDICATIONS SUBJECT TO INTERFERENCE FROM 
STATIC, eg ADF.
ix. TURN THE COCKPIT LIGHTING FULLY ON AND LOWER THE CREW SEATS AND SUN VISORS 
TO MINIMISE THE EFFECT OF ANY LIGHTNING FLASHES.
x. FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURER’S OR OPERATOR’S RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF 
THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR, AUTOPILOT AND MANOMETRIC LOCKS. If these are not stated, 
height, Mach, rate of climb or descent, and airspeed locks should be disengaged but the 
yaw damper(s), if fitted, should remain operative. On many aircraft the autopilot, when 
engaged in a suitable mode (turbulence or basic attitude modes), is likely to produce lower 
structural loads than would result from manual flight. However, if major trim movements 
occur due to the autopilot’s automatic trim the autopilot should be disengaged. Note that 
Mach trim operation may also occur on some aircraft but the Mach trim should remain 
engaged.
xi. Continue operating, not just monitoring, the weather radar, or other on-board systems, 
in order to select the safest track for penetration, and to minimise the time of exposure 
whilst avoiding areas of intense activity.
xii. Be prepared for turbulence, rail, hail, snow, icing, lightning, static discharge and windshear. 
In turbine-powered aircraft switch on the continuous ignition system (to reduce the 
possibility of engine flame-out due to water ingestion) ensuring that limitations on its 
use, if any, are not exceeded. Also see AIC 29/2004 (Pink 64) - ‘Engine Malfunction 
caused by Lightning Strikes’.
xiii. AVOID FLYING OVER THE TOP OF A THUNDERSTORM WHENEVER POSSIBLE. Overflying 
small convective cells close to large storms should also be avoided, particularly if they 
are on the upwind side of a large storm, because they may grow very quickly. Similarly, 
do not contemplate flying beneath the cumulonimbus cloud. In addition to the dangers 
associated with turbulence, rain, hail, snow or lightning, there may well be low cloud 
base, poor visibility and possibly low-level windshear.
b. Within the Storm Area:
i. CONTROL THE AIRCRAFT REGARDLESS OF ALL ELSE.
ii. CONCENTRATE ON MAINTAINING A CONSTANT PITCH ATTITUDE APPROPRIATE TO 
CLIMB, CRUISE OR DESCENT, BY REFERENCE TO THE ATTITUDE INDICATORS, CAREFULLY 
AVOIDING HARSH OR EXCESSIVE CONTROL MOVEMENTS. DO NOT BE MISLED BY 
CONFLICTING INDICATIONS ON OTHER INSTRUMENTS. DO NOT ALLOW LARGE ATTITUDE 
EXCURSIONS IN THE ROLLING PLANE TO PERSIST BECAUSE THESE MAY RESULT IN NOSE 
DOWN PITCH CHANGES.
iii. MAINTAIN THE ORIGINAL HEADING - IT IS USUALLY THE QUICKEST WAY OUT. DO NOT 
ATTEMPT ANY TURNS.

Thunderstorms
iv. DO NOT CORRECT FOR ALTITUDE GAINED OR LOST THROUGH UP AND DOWN DRAUGHTS 
UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.
v. Maintain the trim settings and avoid changing the power setting except when necessary 
to restore margins from stall warning or high-speed buffet. The target pitch attitude 
should not be changed unless the mean IAS differs significantly from the recommended 
penetration speed.
vi. If trim variations due to the autopilot (auto-trim) are large, the autopilot should be 
disengaged. However, movement of the Mach trim, where it occurs, is necessary and 
desirable. Check that the yaw-damper remains engaged.
vii. If negative ‘G’ is experienced, temporary warnings (eg low oil pressure) may occur. These 
should be ignored.
viii. ON NO ACCOUNT CLIMB IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET OVER THE TOP OF THE STORM.
c. After a Thunderstorm Encounter - In flight:
i. If hail has been encountered, considerable damage to the airframe, not visible from the 
cockpit or cabin, may have occurred. Consideration should therefore be given to diverting 
to a suitable and nearby aerodrome where the aircraft can be inspected for damage. If 
this damage has occurred to aerodynamically significant areas, eg a nose radome, the 
increased drag will affect fuel burn. Thus the aircraft, if continuing to its destination, may 
burn considerably more fuel than expected or planned.
  Actual fuel usage should now be monitored very closely, bearing in mind that some 
FMS calculate ‘expected overhead destination’ fuel, based on data that assumes normal 
(planned) conditions and normal (ie fully clean) aircraft aerodynamic states.
ii. If the aircraft has been struck by lightning, treat all magnetic information (eg from 
direct or remote indicating compasses) with extreme caution. The large electric currents 
associated with a lightning strike can severely and permanently distort the magnetic field 
of an aircraft rendering all such information highly inaccurate.
d. Air Traffic Control Considerations:
i. Modern ATC radars in general do not display the build up of weather that may constitute 
a hazard to aircraft and ATC advice on weather avoidance may, therefore, be limited.
ii. If, as recommended in this Circular, a pilot intends to detour round observed weather 
when in receipt of an Air Traffic Service that involves ATC responsibility for separation, 
clearance should first be obtained from ATC so that separation from other aircraft can be 
maintained. If for any reason the pilot is unable to contact ATC to inform the controller 
of his/her intended action, any manoeuvre should be limited to the extent necessary 
to avoid immediate danger and ATC must be informed as soon as possible. In oceanic 
airspace the weather deviation procedure in PANS-ATM, (ICAO Doc 4444) paragraph 
15.2.3 should be followed.
iii. Because of the constraints on airspeed and flight path and the increased workload of 
the crew when flying in a Terminal Manoeuvring Area, pilots should consider making a
--- Page 260 ---
Thunderstorms
14
254
14
Thunderstorms
diversion from, or delaying entry to, a Terminal Manoeuvring Area if a storm encounter 
seems probable.
e. Take-off and Landing Problems:
i. The take-off, initial climb, final approach and landing phases of flight present the pilot 
with additional problems because of the aircraft’s proximity to the ground, thus the 
maintenance of a safe flight path in these phases can be very difficult.
ii. Some operators give advice on the airspeed adjustments to be made to allow for windshear 
or turbulence (a speed increase of up to 20 knots according to the type of aircraft and 
the degree of turbulence may be required). The best advice that can be given to the pilot 
is that, when there are thunderstorms over or near the aerodrome, he/she should delay 
take-off or, when approaching to land, hold in an unaffected area or divert to a suitable 
alternate. For further relevant information see AIC 84/2008 (Pink 150) - ‘Low Altitude 
Windshear’.
f. Airworthiness and Maintenance Considerations:
i. Severe weather conditions may cause damage to aircraft and power plant installations, 
some of which may be invisible to the naked eye. Flight Manuals and Maintenance 
documents may quantify levels of turbulence which would trigger a maintenance 
inspection, similar to those that may be applicable to ‘heavy landings’. Hail and lightning 
damage may often be obvious to crews; however, there will be occasions where damage 
may be restricted to parts of the airframe not normally visible from the ground, or from 
the cockpit, immediately following a thunderstorm encounter.
ii. In the event that crews believe that an aircraft has been exposed to hail, lightning, 
turbulence greater than ‘moderate’, or a heavy landing, they should record the fact(s) 
in the technical log on arrival to ensure that an appropriate inspection is completed prior 
to a subsequent release to service. Operators should ensure that procedures in operation 
manuals for flight crews and maintenance personnel reflect this advice.
g. Light aircraft operators should ensure that their aircraft are adequately secured on the 
ground when severe thunderstorm activity is forecast.

Concluding Remarks
4.1 	
DO NOT TAKE OFF IF A THUNDERSTORM IS OVERHEAD OR APPROACHING.
4.2 	
AT DESTINATION HOLD CLEAR IF A THUNDERSTORM IS OVERHEAD OR APPROACHING. 
DIVERT IF NECESSARY.
4.3	
 AVOID SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS EVEN AT THE COST OF DIVERSION OR AN 
INTERMEDIATE LANDING. IF AVOIDANCE IS IMPOSSIBLE, THE PROCEDURES RECOMMENDED 
IN THE FLIGHT OR OPERATIONS MANUAL OR IN THIS CIRCULAR SHOULD BE FOLLOWED.
4.4 	
Pilots of turbo-jet swept-wing transport aircraft are advised to ensure that they are fully 
conversant with the control problems that may be met in turbulence with the type of aircraft 
they fly.
4.5 	
AFTER AN ENCOUNTER WITH A THUNDERSTORM CONSIDER REPORTING THE 
EVENT IN THE AIRCRAFT TECHNICAL LOG. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT A FULL AND PROPER 
INVESTIGATION OF THE AIRCRAFT OCCURS.

Thunderstorms, Flight Hazards and Weather Radar
1.1	
A thunderstorm cloud, whether of the air mass or frontal type, usually consists of several 
self-contained cells, each in a different state of development. It must be stressed that the storm 
clouds are only the visible part of a turbulent system that extends over a much greater area. 
New and growing cells can be recognised by their cumuliform shape with clear-cut outline 
and ‘cauliflower’ top, while the tops of more mature cells will appear less clear-cut and will 
frequently be surrounded by fibrous cloud. It is important, however, to remember that the 
development of cells, which can be very rapid, will not always be seen, even in daylight, since 
other clouds may obscure the view. In frontal or orographic conditions, for instance, where 
forced ascent of air may give the impetus required for producing vigorous convection currents, 
extensive layer cloud structures may obscure a view of the development of Cumulonimbus 
thunderstorm cells or Altocumulus Castellanus; the latter is cumuliform cloud with a base above 
8000 ft and is an indication of middle level instability which often precedes, or is associated with, 
the development of thunderstorms. Mammatus clouds, udder shaped features seen beneath 
cumulonimbus clouds, or the associated medium level altocumulus layer clouds (above 8000 
ft), or in association with the high-level cirrus anvil cloud (above 20 000 ft), are an indication of 
strong vertical winds with associated turbulence.
1.2	
The most severe thunderstorms require an increase in the general wind speed and a 
change in direction with height to maintain a release of energy. With no vertical windshear, as 
the cloud grows and the updraught strengthens, precipitation forms in the upper parts of the 
cloud. As the precipitation falls towards the ground, it exerts a drag on the updraught, which 
weakens and the cloud decays. However, for a storm that has the downdraught offset from the 
updraught, particularly where the updraught is not cut off at the surface by the spreading out 
of the cold downdraught, it can develop into a self-generating system that can last for hours, 
independently of any surface heating.
1.3 	
These up and downdraughts are of comparable intensity, often in close proximity to 
each other and frequently reach speeds in excess of 3000 ft per minute. Sharp gusts with 
vertical speeds of 10 000 ft per minute have been measured. The horizontal extent of these 
vertical draughts may, occasionally, be more than a mile. The top of a developing cell has 
been observed to rise at more than 5000 ft per minute. When thunderstorms are associated 
with frontal conditions, areas of ‘line squall’ activity can extend for more than 100 miles. The 
vertical extent of storms will vary considerably but it is not uncommon for them to penetrate 
the tropopause with cloud tops exceeding 40 000 ft in temperate latitudes and 60 000 ft in sub-
tropical and tropical regions. Although an individual cell will usually last for less than an hour, a 
storm system, with new cells developing and old ones decaying, may persist for several hours.
1.4	
Areas in which conditions will be favourable for the development of thunderstorms 
can usually be forecast successfully several hours in advance but it is not possible at present 
to determine the precise location and distribution of individual storms. Where up-to-date 
ground weather radar information is available, however, useful information on the expected 
movement of an individual storm can be forecast for periods of up to an hour or so ahead.
1.5	
As a general rule of thumb, in the UK, the movement of a cumulonimbus cloud is in 
the direction of the 10000 ft (700 hectopoascals) wind, though the tendency for large storms 
to distort wind fields and the development of new cells will cause variations in this general 
movement.

Thunderstorms
1.6 	
All thunderstorms are potentially dangerous. This considered, there are two facts that 
should be borne in mind. The first is that a severe storm can occur in practically any geographical 
area in which thunderstorms are known. The second is that no useful correlation  exists between 
the external visual appearance (or the weather radar appearance) of thunderstorm clouds and 
the turbulence and hail within them.
2	
 Flight Hazards
2.1 	
Turbulence Associated with Thunderstorms
2.1.1 	
The air movement in thunderstorms, generally referred to as turbulence and composed 
of draughts (sustained vertical or sloping currents) and gusts (irregular and local variations), can 
become violent, dangerous and even destructive, reaching a maximum intensity in developing 
and mature cells. High rates of roll and large pitching motions have been experienced in these 
storms, as have large vertical displacements of as much as 5000 ft. These extreme variations 
will, of course, only occur in the most severe conditions. Of equal importance is the fact that 
eddies, which are felt as gusts, can occur some distance outside a thunderstorm cell. The regions 
around or between adjacent cells are therefore likely to be turbulent - severely so at times - and 
severe turbulence is often found 15 to 20 miles downwind of a severe storm core. Conditions at 
or near the surface in the vicinity of thunderstorms are often rough because, during the mature 
stage of the cells, the outflow from the base is of a turbulent nature and the air is colder than 
its environment, producing a miniature cold front often accompanied by heavy precipitation 
and squally conditions. When this is associated with a line of thunderstorms its effects can 
be felt as much as 40 miles ahead of them. Take-offs and landings in these circumstances are 
hazardous. Severe turbulence can also be encountered several thousand feet above the tops of 
active thunderstorm clouds, particularly when the speed of the wind at this level is high (100 kt 
or more). It is therefore advisable to avoid flying and in particular not to climb, in these areas.
2.1.2	
A thunderstorm cell must be well developed before lightning first occurs but it may 
continue in the decaying cell. Lightning must not, therefore, be regarded as a reliable guide to 
the degree of turbulence in a cloud.
2.1.3 	 Accidents involving loss of control of the aircraft have been caused by flying in and 
around thunderstorms. In some instances there was structural failure that probably occurred 
during the attempt to regain control.
2.1.4 	 Stress requirements for modern transport aircraft are set at a level which experience has 
shown will rarely be reached. Nevertheless, flight research has indicated that, in the extreme 
conditions that may exist within thunderstorms, abnormal pilot-induced loads are added to 
already high gust-loads such that stress limits may be exceeded.
2.1.5	
In some instances the correct flying technique is difficult to achieve. Indications are 
that loss of control, which may follow the use of incorrect techniques, is a more serious hazard 
than the risk of structural failure due directly to an encounter with turbulence. This is because 
recovery manoeuvres are likely to subject the aircraft to great stresses that may lead to structural 
failure or serious deformation.
2.2 	
Thunderstorm Windshear
2.2.1 Accidents have occurred during the take-off, initial climb and final approach phases of 
flight, which were probably due in part, if not entirely, to the effect of a rapid variation in 
wind velocity known as windshear. For further information see AIC 84/2008 (Pink 150) - ‘Low

Altitude Windshear’. Unlike the erratic fluctuations caused by gusts, windshear gives rise to 
airspeed fluctuations of a more sustained nature and is therefore likely to be more dangerous. 
Gusts are likely to accompany windshear conditions.
2.2.2 	 Thunderstorms frequently produce windshear and, although it is hazardous at all levels, 
it is in the lower levels that windshear may have more drastic consequences. Winds caused by 
the outflow of cold air from the base of a thunderstorm cell have been known to change in 
shallow layers of a few hundred feet by as much as 80 kt in speed and 90º or more in direction. 
Due to the effect of inertia, an aircraft in flight will tend to maintain its ground speed and 
windshear will therefore produce airspeed variations that can be large enough to be extremely 
dangerous.
2.3 	
Tornadoes
2.3.1 	 Tornadoes present a very serious threat to aircraft. A Fokker F-28 flying in cloud at 
3000 ft shortly after take-off from Rotterdam was destroyed by a tornado on 6 October 1981. 
Tornadoes are generally associated with organised severe local storms. They occur frequently in 
the United States but can also arise in the UK and Europe although they are less common and 
seldom as violent. There is evidence that tornado circulation may extend throughout the depth 
of the storm and constitute a hazard to aircraft at all heights.
2.3.2 	 The most violent thunderstorms draw air into their cloud bases with great vigour. If the 
incoming air has any initial rotating motion, it often forms an extremely concentrated vortex 
from the surface well into the cloud. Meteorologists have estimated that wind velocities in 
such a vortex can exceed 200 kt. Because pressure inside the vortex is quite low, the strong 
winds gather dust and debris and the low pressure generates a funnel-shaped cloud extending 
downward from the cumulonimbus base. If the cloud does not reach the surface, it is a ‘funnel 
cloud’; if it touches the land surface, it is a tornado.
2.3.3 	 Tornadoes occur with both isolated and squall line thunderstorms. An aircraft entering 
a tornado vortex is almost certain to suffer structural damage. Since the vortex extends well 
into the cloud, any pilot flying on instruments in a severe thunderstorm could encounter a 
hidden vortex.
2.3.4 	 Families of tornadoes have been observed as appendages of the main cloud extending 
several miles outward from the area of lightning and precipitation. Thus any cloud connected 
to a severe thunderstorm carries a threat.
2.4 	
Hail
2.4.1 	 Notwithstanding all the work that has been done in the field of thunderstorm 
forecasting, no confirmed or fully reliable method has yet been evolved for recognising a 
storm that will produce hail. It is safest to assume that hail exists in one part or another of 
every thunderstorm at some stage in its life. The higher the lapse rate and the greater the 
moisture content of the air mass, the stronger will be the convective activity which increases 
the likelihood of the formation of damaging hail. Stability in the upper atmosphere results in 
the characteristic anvil shape of the spreading-out of the top of the cumulonimbus cloud and 
strong upper winds will often cause hail to fall from the overhang. Flight beneath the overhang 
should be avoided.
2.4.2	
 The maximum size of hailstones which have been found on the ground is around five 
and a half inches in diameter. It is known that hailstones of four inches in diameter can be 
encountered at 10 000 ft and damaging hail up to 45 000 ft.
--- Page 264 ---
Thunderstorms

Thunderstorms
2.4.3 	 Although hail encounters are usually of short duration, damage to aircraft can be severe. 
Hail may damage the leading edges and hence reduce the efficiency of the wing. Windscreens 
or other transparencies may be shattered. In an encounter in the Middle East, hail severely 
damaged the airframe of a VC-10 that encountered a thunderstorm shortly after take-off. The 
radome was torn away, denting and damage to the skin occurred in many areas, but there was 
no evidence of a lightning strike.
2.4.4 	 Although no fatal accidents to civil aircraft are known to have been attributable 
entirely to hail damage, hail can be a serious hazard at all altitudes at which civil aircraft 
operate. Evidence for this comes from a study of military aircraft accidents in the USA, in which 
aircraft were damaged or destroyed by the combined effect of hail and turbulence and from 
experience gained through the United States National Severe Storms Project together with 
individual reports of encounters with hail in normal operations.
2.5 	
Rain
2.5.1 	 Water ingestion by turbine engines
2.5.1.1 	Turbine engines have a limit on the amount of water they can ingest. Updraughts are 
present in many thunderstorms, particularly those in the developing stages. If the updraught 
velocity in the thunderstorm approaches or exceeds the terminal velocity of the falling 
raindrops, very high concentrations of water may occur. It is possible that these concentrations 
can be in excess of the quantity of water turbine engines are designed to ingest, which could 
result in flame out and/or structural failure of one or more engines.
2.5.1.2 	At the present time, there is no known operational procedure that can completely 
eliminate the possibility of engine damage/flame out during massive water ingestion but 
although the exact mechanism of these water induced engine stalls has not been determined, 
it is believed that thrust changes may have an adverse effect on engine stall margins.
2.5.1.3 	To eliminate the risk of engine damage or flame out by heavy rain, it is essential to 
avoid severe storms. During an unavoidable encounter with extreme precipitation, the best-
known recommendation is to follow the severe turbulence penetration procedure contained 
in the approved aircraft flight manual, with special emphasis on avoiding thrust changes unless 
excessive airspeed variations occur. Flight research has revealed that water can exist in large 
quantities at high altitudes even where the ambient temperature is as low as -30°C. Rain, 
sometimes heavy, may therefore be encountered and give rise to ice accretion and a possibility 
of the malfunctioning of pressure instruments. Turbine engine igniters must be switched on.
2.5.2 	 Heavy precipitation, which occurs in cumulonimbus clouds, may often be seen as 
shafts of rain below the cloud base. Where this precipitation does not reach the surface, the 
shafts are known as virga. The evaporation cooling associated with virga may intensify existing 
downdraughts.
2.6 	
Icing
2.6.1	
Flight must not be initiated or continued into areas where the forecast icing conditions 
will exceed the icing limitations of the aircraft.
2.6.2	
Formation of ice on the airframe must always be considered likely when flight takes 
place through cloud or rain at a temperature below 0°C. The temperature range favourable 
for ice accretion in thunderstorms is from 0°C down to -45°C, ie where water droplets can exist 
in a supercooled state. Below about -30°C, however, a large part of the free water content of

Thunderstorms
the atmosphere normally consists of ice particles or crystals and snowflakes and chances of 
severe icing at these low temperatures are, therefore, greatly reduced. Conversely, because 
of downdraughts, the freezing level inside thunderstorm clouds must be assumed to drop to 
the base of the cloud. Airframe icing can therefore be expected everywhere in a thunderstorm 
cloud.
2.6.3 	 In piston engines, loss of power can occur over a wide range of temperatures as a 
result of the formation of ice in the induction system. Proper use of carburettor heat or other 
induction anti-icing equipment is therefore essential to prevent or minimise the loss of power.
Furthermore, in clear air of high humidity (ie of the order of 60% or more), which might exist 
in areas of thunderstorm activity, carburettor ice can easily form.
2.6.4 	 Where turbine engines are concerned, the danger of flame out must be recognised 
whenever icing conditions are met. Igniters must therefore be switched on and remain on 
provided they are cleared for continuous operation. In all circumstances operators’ or 
manufacturers’ instructions must be strictly followed to achieve maximum protection.
2.6.5 	 It must be emphasised that, when flying in thunderstorms, anything more than very 
light ice accretion adds to the problems related to turbulence because of the increased weight 
of the aircraft, the disturbance of the normal airflow and the reduced effectiveness of the 
control surfaces.
2.6.6 	 Experience has shown that, provided the normal precautions are taken (ie using 
the anti-icing or de-icing equipment correctly), icing conditions need not be a grave hazard 
if penetration of a thunderstorm area cannot be avoided. However, failure to recognise or 
anticipate icing conditions, failure to use the equipment properly, equipment unserviceability 
or extended flight through a storm area will all considerably increase the risks involved.
2.7 	
Lightning
2.7.1 	
Lightning can occur both within and away from cumulonimbus clouds, with discharges 
taking place either within the cloud, between neighbouring clouds, or commonly between a 
cloud and the ground and less commonly from the top of a cloud upwards. Most recorded 
lightning strikes have occurred at levels where the temperature is between +10°C and -10°C, ie 
within about 5000 ft above or below the freezing level. Some risk also exists outside this band, 
particularly in the higher levels. Strikes are either electrically positive or negative, although the 
polarity of the strike is not evident at the time. Positive polarity strikes are likely to be the more 
severe (ie cause more damage to the aircraft), and recent investigations have shown that the 
North Sea is an area prone to a higher than normal frequency of positive strikes, although the 
overall frequency of strikes per flying hour is similar to that in the rest of Europe. The presence 
of soft hail has been associated with some positive strikes and may thus be indicative of the 
conditions conducive to a positive strike. For further information regarding lightning and 
aircraft engines see AIC 29/2004 (Pink 64) - ‘Engine Malfunction Caused by Lightning Strikes’.
2.7.2 	 The brilliant flash, the smell of burning and the accompanying explosive noise may be 
alarming and distracting to the pilots of an aircraft struck by lightning. The report on a serious 
accident, in which a large transport aircraft was destroyed, stated that it was due to a lightning 
strike causing ignition of vapour in the region of fuel tank vents but fatal accidents due to 
lightning strikes have fortunately been very few and most aircraft receive only superficial 
damage when struck.
2.7.3 	 The effect of lightning strikes upon both direct reading magnetic compasses and
--- Page 266 ---
Thunderstorms
14
260
14
Thunderstorms
magnetically slaved compasses can be severe with deviations of many tens of degrees having 
been recorded. Magnetic compasses should not be relied upon after an aircraft has been struck 
and should be checked as soon as possible.
2.8 Static Electricity
2.8.1 	 This phenomenon will generally first be noticed as noise on the High and Medium 
frequency radio bands and also, to a lesser extent, on VHF receivers. As the static electricity 
increases in severity, the noise will increase and in extreme cases a visible discharge, known 
as St Elmo’s fire, will be seen on some parts of the aircraft, particularly around the edges of 
windscreens. Static electricity is not associated only with thunderstorms but such conditions are 
particularly favourable to its creation. Although it is not normally dangerous, there have been 
rare incidents when a static discharge has occurred across a windscreen or plastic panel causing 
it to break.
2.8.2 	 An understanding of the effect of static electricity on radio equipment is important. 
It is detrimental to the performance of MF (eg ADF) and HF equipment but has little or no 
effect upon VHF and UHF. On HF, static may cause the signal-to-noise ratio to be such that 
communications are impossible. In these conditions navigational aids such as ADF must be used 
with extreme caution due to the fluctuating or erroneous indications that may occur.
2.9 	
Instrumental Errors and Limitations
2.9.1 	 Altimeters and Vertical Speed Indicators
2.9.1.1 	Local pressure variations can occur in or very close to a thunderstorm at all heights 
and this, together with local gusts, may give rise to errors in the indications of altimeters and 
vertical speed indicators. There is some doubt as to the magnitude of altitude errors but there 
is evidence that they can be as much as ± 1000 ft. It is essential, for ground clearance purposes, 
that due allowance is made for such errors when flying in or near thunderstorm areas. Near 
the surface, periods of heavy rain are an indication of the likelihood of pressure variations and 
gusts.
2.9.2 	 Airspeed Indicators
2.9.2.1 	Despite the precautions taken in the design of pitot heads, there is still a possibility that 
very heavy rain may cause an airspeed indicator to give a false indication even when the pitot 
head heaters are used. If the power which gives the safest speed for penetration has been 
selected before a storm is entered, no action should be taken to correct for violent or short 
period airspeed indicator oscillations, provided a reasonably level attitude is maintained.
2.9.3 	 Attitude Indicators
2.9.3.1 	Attitude is indicated by instruments presenting pitch and roll information alone or by 
other more complex flight directors containing attitude indication amongst other elements.
2.9.3.2 	The simple artificial horizons fitted to most aircraft, either as the main attitude indicator 
or as a standby instrument when remote reading indicators are installed, provide indications of 
pitch angle up to 85° nose up and down and may have complete freedom in the rolling plane. 
Except in rare circumstances these instruments give an adequate range of indication but may 
lack referencing, which would enable the pilot to assess attitude accurately at large angles of 
pitch or be given maximum assistance in recovery from any unusual attitudes.

Thunderstorms
2.9.3.3	Pitch referencing is also lacking on the attitude indicators of some flight director 
presentations. Moreover, their range of indication is much less than 85° up and down, in some 
cases less than 30°. The presentation of information on these earlier instruments does not give 
an indication to the pilot of the point at which the aircraft’s pitch attitude exceeds the limit of 
indication of the instrument. These instruments therefore give no guidance as to the progress 
of recovery from attitudes outside their normal range of indication.
2.9.3.4	The wide variety of instruments which may be encountered makes it essential that pilots 
are fully aware of the limitations of the particular attitude indicator(s) fitted in the aircraft they 
fly.
2.9.4 	 Magnetic Compasses
2.9.4.1 	Magnetic compasses are likely to be seriously affected by a lightning strike. They should 
not be relied upon after an aircraft has been struck and should be checked as soon as possible.
2.10 	
Use of Weather Radar
2.10.1 	 Pilots should be in no doubt about the function of airborne weather radar. It is provided 
principally to enable them to AVOID thunderstorms although they can be of assistance in 
penetrating areas of storm activity, where avoidance has not been possible. However, pilots 
should also be aware of the potential for displayed data to be unreliable when used for 
calculating the safe vertical clearance for the overflight of active storm cells.
2.10.2 	 Pilots should be familiar with the characteristics and operation of the radar in their 
aircraft and its limitations. Operators should ensure that their crews are given adequate 
instructions in relation to the radar equipment fitted to its aircraft, including the operation of 
the antenna and radar controls and on the adjustment and interpretations of the display.
2.10.3 It should be noted that the subject of airborne weather radar is quite complex and whilst 
the following notes give a generalised overview, they are no substitute for manufacturers’ 
instructions in relation to specific products.
a. Most modern airborne weather radars operate in the frequency band of 8-12 GHz (ie 
wavelengths between 2.5 and 4 cm). This band, sometimes known as the ‘X’ band, was 
chosen for weather radars as it is highly sensitive to wet precipitation which is a feature of 
most weather systems that might need to be avoided by pilots. Airborne weather radars 
do not detect turbulence, although turbulent air, particularly within a thunderstorm, 
often contains water. In some radars, a change in frequency (a Doppler shift) in the 
reflected (returned) radar signal caused by moving precipitation is measured and is used 
to give an indication of likely turbulence.
b. Although wet precipitation is the most reflective of radar signals, other water products 
will reflect lesser amounts of incident radar energy. In descending order (ie from most to 
least reflective) these are: wet hail, rain, hail, ice crystals, wet snow, dry hail and dry snow.
c. The intensity of the returned radar signal will also be affected by the range of the aircraft 
from the precipitation, the amplification of signal (gain) being used by the receiver and 
the aerial tilt setting.
d. It should be noted that, with weather radars, the significance of radar returns of given 
intensity usually increases with altitude, but the strength of the echo is not an indication 
of the strength of any associated turbulence.
--- Page 268 ---
Thunderstorms
14
262
14
Thunderstorms
e. Radar return intensities may also be misleading because of attenuation resulting from 
intervening heavy rain. This may lead to serious underestimation of the severity of the 
rainfall in a large storm and an incorrect assumption of where the heaviest rainfall is likely 
to be encountered. The echo from that part of an area of rain furthest from the radar 
will be relatively weaker, and the actual position of the maximum rainfall at the far edge 
of the storm area will be further away than indicated on the radar display, sometimes 
by distances up to several miles. Additionally, a storm cell beyond may be completely 
masked.
f. It should also be noted that, notwithstanding recent research and operational experience, 
it still seems impossible to use radar to detect with certainty areas where large hailstones 
exist, because clouds containing rain or hail can produce identical radar pictures. Some 
operators have claimed success in avoiding hail by keeping well clear of cloud echoes that 
have scalloped edges or pointed or hooked ‘fingers’ attached. The best advice is to give 
radar echoes a wide berth, when detouring storms visually.
g. The high rate of growth of thunderstorms and the danger of flying over or near to 
the tops of both the main storm and the small convective cells close to it must also be 
remembered when using weather radar for storm avoidance.
h. Some guidance on the distances by which thunderstorms should be avoided is given in 
the table below. It is strongly recommended that the decision to avoid a thunderstorm 
be taken early.
i. Where weather information is available from ATC radar, it should be used to supplement 
the aircraft’s weather radar (but see paragraph 3.2(c) of this Annex).

The above avoidance criteria can be simply summarised as: if above 20 000 ft avoid by 
a minimum of 20 NM; if below avoid by a minimum of 10 NM.

3.2 	
If storm clouds have to be overflown, always maintain at least 5000 ft vertical separation 
from cloud tops. It is possible to estimate this separation (using the principle outlined below), 
but ATC or Met information on the altitude of the tops may also be available for further 
guidance:
a. To ensure that the optimum radar beam is used for this purpose, it will be necessary to 
adjust the ‘gain’ control. One particular weather radar manufacturer recommends that 
with an aircraft in straight and level flight and the aerial tilt set to zero (ie with the centre 
of the weather radar beam (ie along the bore-sight) aligned to the horizontal) the gain 
should be reduced until the ‘radar paint’ from the clouds just disappears. The gain should 
then be increased until a ‘solid paint’ is produced and the gain left at this setting for 
the required measurement. The range of the nearest part of this ‘paint’ should then be 
recorded.
b. The beam should now be raised (by adjusting the aerial tilt upwards) until the return 
‘disappears’. The tilt angle associated with this disappearance should be recorded. 
Return the tilt to zero in order to continue to monitor the storm and its development 
and the separation of the aircraft from it. Then either using data provided by the radar 
manufacturer (as in a ‘look-up’ table) or by mental arithmetic the approximate height of 
the cloud top may be obtained. One method of approximation is as follows:
     One half of the notional beam-width as quoted by the radar manufacturer (usually in 
the region of 3° to 4°) should be subtracted from the recorded angle of tilt. Then using 
the 1:60 rule, this remainder should be applied to the recorded range of the edge of the 
return to calculate the height (in nautical miles) that the cloud top is above the aircraft.
    Example: In an aircraft at 20 000 ft, with a radar whose notional beam width is 4°, a cloud 
return at 40 nm is made to ‘disappear’ at an aerial tilt angle of + 3.5°. 3.5 minus 
2 (i.e. ½ the notional beam-width) = 1.5, which, when applied to 40 miles using 
the 1:60 rule, indicates that the cloud tops are 1 NM (or 6000 ft) above the 
aircraft. Thus if the cloud is to be overflown with the minimum recommended 
clearance of 5000 ft, a climb to at least 31 000 ft is indicated. If this course of 
action is followed, do remember that in the finite time it will take the aircraft to 
climb and to close this distance, the top of the storm cloud itself, if very active, 
might easily have ascended to a higher altitude.
c. If the aircraft is not equipped with radar or it is inoperative, avoid by at least 10 miles any 
storm that by visual inspection is tall, growing rapidly or has an anvil top.
d. Intermittently monitor long ranges on radar to avoid getting into situations where no 
alternative remains but to penetrate possibly hazardous areas. Unless otherwise instructed 
by the radar manufacturer, it is usually necessary to adjust both ‘gain’ and ‘tilt’ during this 
monitoring process to ensure that new weather ‘targets’ are not missed and that active 
clouds are continually tracked.
e. Avoid flying under a cumulonimbus overhang. If such flight cannot be avoided, tilt 
antenna full up occasionally to determine, if possible, whether precipitation (which may 
be hail) exists in or is falling from the overhang.
f. Notwithstanding the principle outlined above, or other guidance provided by radar 
manufacturers, or by instructors in radar systems, it should always be borne in mind that 
the result is only an estimate of the height of the storm cloud tops and that the accuracy
--- Page 270 ---

264

Thunderstorms
of the estimate is critically dependent on certain assumptions. These assumptions include 
radar handling (eg that the beam width in actual use is similar to the quoted notional 
beam width; and that the tilt control knob has not slipped on the spindle). It should 
be remembered that weather radars are provided primarily for storm avoidance not 
penetration or overflight.
4 	
Use of Information from a Lightning Discharge Monitor
4.1	
 Instruments are available which indicate and record lightning discharges. However, in 
a similar manner to that of airborne weather radar they should be used for storm avoidance 
and not penetration. They work on the principle that in mature thunderstorms, air turbulence 
has changed the normal distribution of charged particles such that large build-ups of electrical 
charge occur. Lightning dissipates these buildups. These lightning discharges are detected 
by the equipment and normally shown on a screen with its centre that of the aircraft. The 
displayed distance of the discharge from the screen centre is an indication of the strength of 
the lightning discharge; it is not the actual range of the discharge from the aircraft. The distance 
calculated uses an algorithm based around the average strength of lightning discharges. Thus, 
a high power discharge at long range will be displayed at the same distance as a low power 
discharge at short range.
4.2	
 Because lightning is more likely to be associated with the most severe turbulence, an 
area of frequent discharges in a particular direction should be avoided. However, it has been 
found that the first lightning discharges from recently formed cells (where no discharges have 
been evident beforehand) may be particularly strong (ie violent). Thus, the lack of an indication 
of discharge is no guarantee that lightning will not strike. One particular manufacturer 
recommends that pilots using his equipment should manoeuvre their aircraft such that all 
discharge clusters are kept at least 25 NM away.

Visibility
Introduction
Meteorological Optical Range (MOR), or more simply ‘met vis’ is the greatest horizontal 
distance at which a dark object can be recognized by an observer with normal eyesight, or at 
which lights of specified candlepower can be seen by night.
Ground visibility is the visibility of an aerodrome as reported by an accredited observer.
In effect, visibility is a measure of atmospheric clarity, or obscurity. This can be caused by 
water droplets - cloud, fog, rain, or solid particles - sand, dust or smoke, or by a mixture of the 
two - smog (fog and smoke). Ice, in the form of crystals, hail or snow will also reduce visibility. 
Poor visibility is usually associated with stable conditions, anticyclones, cols, inversions and 
light winds.
Visibility is generally better upwind of towns and industrial areas. The presence of hygroscopic 
nucleii means that condensation is likely to take place at relative humidities of less than 100%, 
giving rise to the formation of mist and fog. The various types of reduction in visibility are:
•	 Mist. There is mist if the visibility is 1000 m or more and the relative humidity is greater than 
95% with very small water droplets. The upper limit for reporting mist is usually 5000 m, this 
is discussed under METARs.
•	 Fog. There is fog if the visibility is less than 1000 m and the obscuring agent is water droplets. 
Relative Humidity (RH) will be near 100%.
•	 Haze. There is haze if the visibility is reduced by extremely small solid particles - sand, dust 
or smoke. If the visibility is reduced below 1000 m, it is shown on synoptic charts as 
. 
Again, haze is not usually reported when the visibility is more than 5000 m.
Radiation Fog
Radiation fog is caused by radiation of the earth’s heat at night, and the conductive cooling of 
the air in contact with the ground to below dew point.
If there is a light wind, then fog will form, and in calm conditions the result will be the formation 
of dew.
Conditions necessary for radiation fog to form.
•	 Clear sky - to increase the rate of terrestrial radiation.
•	 High relative humidity - so that a little cooling will be enough to cause saturation and 
condensation.
•	 Light wind - of 2 - 8 kt to mix the layers of air causing turbulence so that droplets will be 
kept in suspension and so that warmer air from above can be brought into contact with the 
cold ground to thicken the fog.

Figure 15.1 Radiation fog
A natural result of the radiative cooling at the surface will be an inversion above the fog layer 
(usually the friction layer).
Times of occurrence.
•	 Predominantly in autumn and winter.
•	 Night and early morning. The lowest temperatures are early morning. Additionally, the first 
insolation provides thermal turbulence and light winds. The latest time at which radiation 
fog can form is about 30 minutes after sunrise.
Location.
•	 Over land - not over sea because there is little DV of temperature.
•	 Firstly in valleys because of the katabatic effect.
•	 In anticyclones, ridges and cols.
Dispersal:
•	 By insolation causing convection which will lift the fog. It will also help to evaporate the 
lower layers.
•	 By a strong wind lifting the fog to form stratus cloud.
Note: In the UK, radiation fog usually clears by 1000 - 1100 hours but may persist all day in 
valleys and in winter.

Visibility
Hill (Orographic) Fog
Hill fog is (usually) stratiform cloud (ST, SC) whose base is lower than the summit of the hills. 
It may be generated when moist stable air is forced to rise over the hills (cap cloud) or by the 
normal turbulence action producing ST and SC.
Figure 15.2 Hill fog
Advection Fog
Advection fog is formed by the movement of warm, moist air over a cold surface. The surface 
can be land or sea.
Figure 15.3 The conditions necessary for advection fog to form
--- Page 276 ---

Visibility
Conditions necessary for advection fog to form:
•	 Winds up to 15 kt to move the air. (May be stronger over sea areas)
•	 A high RH so that relatively little cooling is required to produce saturation and subsequent 
condensation.
•	 A cold surface with a temperature lower than the Dew Point (DP) of the moving air to 
ensure condensation.
Times of occurrence and location:
•	 Over land areas in winter and early spring.
•	 Over sea areas in late spring and early summer but can occur at any time of the year when 
tropical maritime air moves over sea areas whose temperature is below the dew point of 
the air.
•	 Occurs particularly when a SW wind brings tropical maritime air to the UK.
Dispersal:
•	 By a change of air mass. (Wind change).
•	 By a wind speed greater than 15 kt which will lift the fog to form stratus cloud.
Special Areas
Nearly all sea fogs are caused by advection. Good examples are the extensive and persistent 
sea fogs which occur in the region of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and around the 
Kamchatka Peninsula in the North Pacific.
In both cases warm air from the south moves over a cold sea current flowing down from the 
north.
Steaming Fog (Arctic Smoke)
Steaming fog, or as it is sometimes called, Arctic Smoke, occurs over sea in polar regions, e.g. 
the fjords of Greenland, Iceland and the sea areas of high latitudes. It is caused by cold air 
from a land mass moving over a warmer sea. The small amount of evaporation from the sea is 
enough to cause saturation and condensation but the air itself must be very stable.
The fog can be persistent and up to 500 feet thick - may drift inland. Will be dispersed by an 
increase in wind speed or change of direction. Usually only significant in Arctic regions, but the 
‘steam’ may be seen at any latitude when cold air moves over a wet surface.

Frontal Fog
Frontal fog occurs at a warm front or occlusion. The main cause is precipitation lowering the 
cloud base to the ground.
Subsidiary causes are:
•	 Evaporation of standing water on the ground.
•	 Mixing of saturated air with non-saturated air below.
The fog can form along a belt up to 200 NM wide which then travels with the front. Can be 
increased by orographic lifting. Will be dispersed by the passing of the front.
Figure 15.7 Frontal fog
Freezing Fog
The Bergeron theory tells us that, at temperatures below 0°C, the air becomes saturated for 
the formation of ice before it becomes saturated for the formation of water.  Hence water 
vapour will go directly to the solid state at these temperatures.  However, the rarity of freezing 
nucleii in the atmosphere means that when the dew point is below 0°C condensation will take 
place producing supercooled water droplets.  These droplets will then freeze on contact with a 
solid object giving hoar frost (or rime ice).
Freezing fog will also occur when the dew point is above 0°C forming fog but the air then cools 
to a temperature less than 0°C.
Note: if water vapour is in contact with a solid object at temperatures below 0°C then it will 
immediately form ice (hoar frost) missing out the liquid state.
Ice Fog
Ice fog will form in extremely low temperatures (usually below -40°C) when warm moist 
air is introduced into cold saturated air, typically the results of combustion in car engines.

Visibility
Condensation and freezing take place almost simultaneously giving a build up of ice crystals in 
the atmosphere thereby reducing visibility.  This is a rare occurrence experienced in northern 
N. America and northern Eurasia during the winter months.
Visibility Reducers
Apart from very small water droplets, visibility may be reduced by solid particles or precipitation. 
Smoke: Smoke consists of solid particles produced by combustion. Conditions will be worse 
under STABLE (subsiding air) conditions. Smoke may cause widespread reductions, e.g. forest 
fires in Indonesia.
The reduction will depend upon:
•	 Rate of production
•	 Rate of dispersal by wind
•	 Distance from the smoke source
The particles provide ample hygroscopic nuclei for vapour to condense on to, thus increasing 
the severity of radiation fog.
Dust: Dust is a particle less than 0.08 mm in diameter. Because of its lightness, it may be carried 
high into the atmosphere. The surface wind speed is likely to exceed 15 kt and as the speed 
increases, so will the height to which the dust will rise.
Figure 15.8 Dust storm rising to 11 000 ft (75 miles SSE of Damascus)
Dust storms mainly occur in daylight due to the DV of wind, but simple dust is very small, it may 
stay in suspension and visibility not improve for a day or so. Examples are the Khamsin and 
Haboobs, which will be covered later.
Sand: Sand consists of particles between 0.08 and 0.3 mm in diameter. Wind speed will be 
20 kt or more. The greater weight of sand particles means that they will only be carried a few 
feet above the surface. Again, more a daylight event, due to the DV of wind.
Visibility: In dust storms or sandstorms visibility is likely to be reduced to less than 1000 m.
Precipitation: Reductions in visibility caused by precipitation have already been covered in 
Chapter 13 Cloud Formation and Precipitation, but to recap, they are:

Visibility Measurement
•	 By day. Measurements are made by reference to suitable objects at known distances from 
an observing position.
Figure 15.9 Visibility measurement: day
•	 By night. Transmissometers or forward scatter meters are used to measure visibility at night, 
see below.
Runway Visual Range (RVR)
RVR is the maximum distance that a pilot 15 ft above the runway in the touchdown area can 
see marker boards by day or runway lights by night when looking in the direction of take-off 
or landing. The RVR can be assessed by positioning an observer 76 metres from the centre line 
of the runway in the touchdown area to sight the number of marker board or lights in the 
appropriate direction. RVR is reported when meteorological optical range (MOR) or (I)RVR 
falls to less than 1500 m, or when shallow fog is reported or forecast.
The United Kingdom standard RVR reporting incremental scale is 25 m between 0 and 400 m, 
50 m between 400 and 800 m, and 100 m above 800 m. If traffic is more or less continuous, 
readings are taken every 30 minutes, or when a significant change in the normal visibility occurs.

Visibility
If traffic is light, readings are taken 15 minutes before a take-off or landing. RVR is never 
forecast. There is no connection between RVR and MOR, but there are factors which may be 
applied for regulatory purposes (see Air Law Notes). Generally, RVR is greater than MOR.
Figure 15.10 Runway visual range
Transmissometer
This is an electronic device where the intensity of a light a distance from a photo-electric cell 
gives an indication of the equivalent daytime visibility. This has the advantage of a constant 
measurement of visibility, but the disadvantage is that only a small portion of the atmosphere 
is being sampled.

Visibility
Instrumented Runway Visual Range (IRVR)
Three Transmissometers are positioned alongside the runway.
A transmissometer comprises a light source transmitter and photo-electric cell receiver which 
are separated from each other.
The strength of current in the receiver is dependent on the clarity of the air between the 
transmitter and the receiver.
IRVR is reported when the normal visibility is 1500 metres or less, or when shallow fog is 
reported or forecast.
Readings are sent to ATC. Three readings can be given, one each for touch-down zone, mid-
point and stop-end, e.g.: R28L / 600 400 550.

Forward Scatter Visibility Meters
Transmissometers are being replaced with forward scatter visibility meters.  The principle is that 
a narrow light beam is forward projected from a transmitter.  A narrow aperture receiver is set 
at an angle in the range of 20° to 50° to the transmitter.  The receiver measures the amount of 
scattered light received from the transmitter.  This amount will be dependent on the number 
and type of particles (water droplets, ice crystals or solid particles) which are present in the 
atmosphere.
Figure 15.13 
By using 3 sensors set at different angles it is possible to determine automatically the substance 
reducing the visibility and hence calculate an accurate visibility.  The forward scatter visibility 
meters will be sited in similar positions to the transmissometers and they too only determine 
visibility in the direction of take-off and landing.
Figure 15.14 
Summary of Visibility Effects
•	 By day visibility is generally poor looking up sun.
•	 By night visibility is usually better looking up moon, because of light reflections from water 
surfaces, railway lines etc.
•	 In precipitation visibility is usually worst in driving snow and very poor in drizzle (because 
of the large number of small droplets).
•	 Night visibility is improved if the pilot does not look at bright cockpit lights.

Icing
An Introduction to Icing and Its Basic Causes
Airframe icing can cause a serious loss of aircraft performance and this will frequently result in 
a large increase in fuel consumption and some difficulty with aircraft control.
Icing is difficult to forecast and therefore there is a need for a full understanding of the 
processes involved.
Ice will form on an airframe if there is:
•	 Water in a liquid state (supercooled water droplets).
•	 Ambient air temperature below 0°C (but see hoar frost).
•	 Airframe temperature below 0°C.
Supercooled Water Droplets (SWD)
A supercooled water droplet is a droplet of water still in the liquid state although its temperature 
is below 0°C.
If the SWD contains a freezing nucleus then the droplet will start to freeze. Mention was made 
in Chapter 6 of condensation nuclei, but as the number of freezing nuclei in the atmosphere is 
considerably less than these, the state of supercooling is a frequent occurrence.
Supercooled water droplets can exist in clouds at temperatures as low as -40°C. However, when 
an aircraft strikes a supercooled water droplet, it will start to freeze.
Supercooled water droplet size is dependent on the size of the basic cloud droplet, (controlled 
by cloud type) and the temperature. As temperature decreases the water droplets evaporate 
thus reducing their size (the Bergeron process, see Chapter 13).
•	 Large supercooled water droplets 0°C to -20°C, CU, CB and NS clouds
•	 Small supercooled water droplets:
•	 Upper levels of CU, CB and NS clouds, -20° to -40°C
•	 ST, SC, AS and AC clouds 0°C to -40°C
•	 Below -40°C only very tiny supercooled water droplets can exist.
The Effects of Icing
•	 AERODYNAMIC. Ice tends to form on leading edges, thereby spoiling the aerodynamic 
shape. The result is reduced lift, increased drag, increased weight, increased stalling speed 
and increased fuel consumption.
Ice, frost or snow of a thickness and roughness similar to coarse sandpaper can reduce lift 
by 30% and increase drag by 40%.
It is also possible for pieces of ice to break off other surfaces and to jam between the control 
surfaces and wings and tail.

Icing
•	 Weight. In severe conditions, ice can form at a rate of 1” in 2 minutes.
There will be a loss of stability due to the weight of ice not being uniform across the airframe.
This can lead to a displaced C of G. Similar uneven weight of ice on propeller blades can 
cause severe engine vibration.
Ice breaking off propellers can cause skin damage.
•	 Instrument effects. Ice can block pressure heads and the readings of ASIs, VSI, altimeters 
and machmeters can be in error as a result.
•	 General. Windscreens and canopies can be obscured.
A thin film of ice/frost can cause skin friction. 
Ice in landing gear wells can affect retraction. 
Ice on aerials can cause static interference.
Clear Ice
If a large supercooled water droplet strikes an aircraft, it will start to freeze and this will release 
latent heat . This will delay the freezing process whilst part of the supercooled water droplet 
will flow back over the impact surface forming clear ice.
The amount of a supercooled water droplet that freezes on impact is 1/80th of the droplet for 
each degree below freezing.
Clear ice is a transparent form of ice formed by large supercooled water droplets, and it can be 
dangerous. There can be much flowback and the ice appears transparent because there is no 
air trapped under the flowback icing.
The ice will destroy aerofoil shapes and its weight can cause problems of control because the 
build-up can be uneven. It is illustrated in Figure 16.1.
Propeller icing can cause severe vibrations and as the ice adheres strongly, when it breaks off, 
the pieces can be large and cause skin damage.
Clear ice forms in Ns, Cu and Cb at temperatures from 0 to -20 °C.
This is the most dangerous form of icing because of the speed at which it can build up on 
the aircraft.

Icing
Rime Ice
When the supercooled water droplets are 
small (at very low temperatures) or when 
cloud droplets are small, the whole droplet 
freezes on impact, each droplet sticking to the 
surface it strikes and becoming solid almost at 
once.
Air becomes trapped between each frozen 
droplet, which makes the ice opaque. Rime 
ice, see Figure 16.2, is a white opaque deposit 
with a light texture. It is caused by small, 
supercooled water droplets freezing quickly.
There is little or no flowback. The ice grows 
out from the leading edges and is compacted 
by the airstream.
Some loss of aerofoil shape can occur and air 
intakes can be affected.
Rime ice can occur in any cloud where there 
are small supercooled water droplets; Ns, As, 
Ac, SC, St and the parts of heap clouds where 
supercooled water droplets are small.
Mixed Ice
Very often in cloud, at temperatures between 
0° and -20°C we find a mixture of both large 
and small supercooled water droplets.  This 
produces a build-up of ice on the leading edges 
from the small droplets and the flowback from 
the large droplets giving a combination of the 
worst effects of both clear and rime ice.
Rain Ice
Rain ice occurs in rain which becomes 
supercooled by falling from an inversion into 
air below 0°C.	
The rain does not freeze immediately in the air 
but can impact the aerofoil to form clear ice or 
rime ice.
Rain ice builds up very quickly and a pilot’s action should be to turn onto a reciprocal heading 
immediately.
Rain ice occurs in a narrow range of altitudes at low level, about 1000 ft, ahead of a warm 
front or occlusion and is associated particularly with the moderate continuous rain which often 
falls from nimbostratus cloud. This is illustrated in Figure 16.3.

Rain ice is rare over the UK, but is common in winter over North America and Central Europe.
Pack Snow
Pack snow is icing which is due to a mixture of supercooled water droplets and snow. It can 
block air intakes and other aircraft openings. Normally the effects are slight.
Hoar Frost
Hoar frost is a white crystal deposit which appears similar to frost on the ground. It occurs 
in clear air. Hoar frost will form if the airframe temperature is below 0°C and the ambient 
temperature is lowered to saturation level. Water vapour in contact with the airframe is 
converted to ice crystals without becoming liquid, i.e. sublimating. This process requires the 
presence of another type of ice nucleus, the sublimation nucleus. Their composition is usually 
inorganic, e.g. volcanic dust, clay or soil particles.
There are two situations where hoar frost can occur:
•	 on the ground. This usually occurs at night and is similar to the frost which forms on a car. 
It must be cleared before take-off because:
•	 Skin friction will increase the take-off run.
•	 Windscreens will be obscured.
•	 Radio interference will be caused by ice on aerials.
•	 in flight. Hoar frost can occur in flight in the following cases:
•	 If a rapid descent is made from a very cold region to a warm moist layer.
•	 If a climb is made from a temperature below 0°C through an inversion.
The icing is not severe. The effects can be overcome by flying in a region where the temperature 
is above 0°C or by flying faster to increase the kinetic heating.

as follows:

For layer clouds small supercooled water droplets are

present from 0°C to -20°C
LIGHT RIME ICE	
	
For layer clouds supercooled water droplets are smaller below 
-20°C.
RIME ICE	
	
	
Supercooled water droplets are also small in Cu, Cb and Ns from 
-20°C to -40°C.
At -40°C and below, supercooled water droplets are very small and icing is usually negligible. 
•	 Concentration of supercooled water droplets. The concentration of water droplets is 
higher in heap clouds because the up currents are stronger. Hence Cu and Cb clouds have a 
high concentration of supercooled water droplets and this causes the icing to be moderate 
to severe.
There is always a greater concentration of droplets near the base of the cloud where it is 
warmest. Icing severity (by cloud types) tends to be:
•	 Cu, Cb - Moderate to severe.
•	 Ns - Moderate to severe.
•	 Sc - Light to moderate, but may be severe in mountainous areas.
•	 Ac, As and St - Light
•	 Ci, Cs and Cc - Nil or trace

Figure 16.4 The concentration of supercooled water droplets
•	 Shape of the aircraft. Figure 16.5. illustrates the air flow around thin and thick wing shapes. 
Thin shapes collect ice more rapidly than high drag ones. Thin wings and pressure heads are 
therefore liable to rapid icing. High speeds also result in a greater ice hazard because the 
airframe strikes a greater number of supercooled water droplets in unit time. Kinetic heating 
may cancel this effect. The wing of a small aircraft has a relatively broad cross-section so will 
accumulate ice relatively slowly.  Other parts of the aircraft; tail-plane, undercarriage struts 
and antenna have relatively narrow cross-sections so will accumulate ice more rapidly.  So 
a small amount of ice on the mainplane could indicate more serious icing elsewhere on the 
aircraft.
Figure 16.5 Thin wing forms collect ice more rapidly than high drag forms
•	 Cloud base temperature. The higher the temperature, the greater the water vapour content.
Condensation first occurs at the base, and there is therefore a greater amount of free water 
to become ice on an airframe. The free water content at any level in the cloud increases with 
base temperature.
Concentration of drops will increase and so will icing severity. An illustration of this is shown

Although a rise of temperature due to kinetic heating to above 0°C may prevent ice accretion, 
a rise to below 0°C may increase the risk and the severity.

Icing Forecasts
Forecasting airframe icing is a matter of forecasting clouds, both by type and vertical extent. 
The degree of airframe icing is classed as light, moderate, or severe.
When rain ice is expected, it will be mentioned specifically in the forecast. Forecasts of engine 
icing are not normally provided.

Icing
The height where ambient temperature is zero is called the freezing level.
It is usually given in forecasts on an area basis by reference to the height of the Zero Degree 
Isotherm.
With an inversion, two freezing levels are possible.
Freezing levels in the south of the United Kingdom average 11 000 ft in August and 3000 ft in 
February.
Reporting of Icing
The following extract from the UK Air Pilot is a useful description of the degree of icing 
encountered in flight.
Airframe Icing
All pilots encountering unforecast icing are requested to report time, location, level, intensity, 
icing type and aircraft type to the ATS unit with whom they are in radio contact. It should be 
noted that the following icing intensity criteria are reporting definitions; they are not necessarily 
the same as forecasting definitions because reporting definitions are related to aircraft type 
and to the ice protection equipment installed, and do not involve cloud characteristics. For 
similar reasons, aircraft icing certification criteria might differ from reporting and/or forecasting 
criteria.
Intensity
Ice Accumulation
Trace
Ice becomes perceptible. Rate of accumulation slightly greater than rate of 
sublimation.
It is not hazardous even though de-icing/anti-icing equipment is not utilized, unless 
encountered for more than one hour.
Light
The rate of accumulation might create a problem if flight in this environment exceeds 
one hour. Occasional use of de-icing/anti-icing equipment removes/prevents 
accumulation.
It does not present a problem if de-icing/anti-icing equipment is used.
(ICAO: Less than moderate icing)
Moderate
The rate of accumulation is such that even short encounters become potentially 
hazardous and use of de-icing/anti-icing equipment, or diversion, is necessary. (ICAO: 
conditions in which change of heading and/or altitude may be considered desirable)
Severe
The rate of accumulation is such that de-icing/anti-icing equipment fails to reduce or 
control the hazard. Immediate diversion is necessary. (ICAO: conditions in which 
immediate change of heading and/or altitude is considered essential)

Piston Engine Induction Icing
•	 Impact icing. Ice in intake areas caused by snow, snow and rain mixed or supercooled 
water droplets.
•	 For turbo-charged (fuel injection) engines, this is the only icing hazard.
•	 Fuel icing. This is caused by water in the fuel freezing in bends in the induction piping.
•	 Carburettor icing. This is caused by:
•	 The sudden temperature drop as latent heat is absorbed when fuel evaporates.
•	 The temperature drop due to the adiabatic expansion of the air as it passes through the 
venturi.
Carburettor icing is most dangerous within a temperature range of -10°C to +25°C, in cloud, 
fog or precipitation at any power setting.

Jet Engine Icing
Ice may form on intake lips or inlet guide vanes.  If this breaks away and enters the engine, 
blade damage may occur.
Some icing may occur in the early inlet stages, particularly at high engine speeds and low 
aircraft forward speeds (e.g during the approach), where much adiabatic cooling may occur 
and temperature reductions of 5°C and more can result.
This icing is particularly prevalent in freezing conditions which are associated with any form of 
precipitation; as a consequence of this, engine anti-icing must be selected “ON” when there is 
precipitation and the indicated outside air temperature is +10°C and below.
Other Factors Affecting Jet Engine Operation In Icing Conditions
•	 Engine power indications may be in error if there is ice on engine inlet (P1) pressure probes.
•	 Engine igniters should be used in potential icing conditions, otherwise engine failure is 
possible.

Questions
•	 Long flights at very low temperatures may cause fuel freezing and fuel freezing point 
specification for the aircraft type should be known.
•	 Clear ice can occur at ambient temperatures above zero when water droplets come into 
contact with an aircraft whose upper surfaces are at or below zero.
This low skin temperature can be caused by a very low fuel temperature conducting through 
the skin.
This icing can also occur on the ground in high humidity, rain, drizzle or fog. It could then 
be snow covered and difficult to detect.
Break up of this ice on take-off can be particularly hazardous to rear engined aircraft.
•	 Operation of anti-icing or de-icing equipment usually implies a performance penalty.

Air Masses
Introduction
An air mass is a large volume of air where the humidity and temperature in the horizontal are 
more or less constant.
The temperature and humidity properties are obtained by the air remaining roughly stationary 
over a surface where conditions are generally constant for some length of time - a high pressure 
area. Therefore at source, all air masses must be stable.
Figure 17.1 General source regions
The basic properties of stability, temperature and humidity can change as an air mass moves 
over surfaces with different properties. An air mass moving to a warmer area will become 
heated in the lower layers and should become:
•	 Unstable.
•	 Warmer.
•	 Lower relative humidity.
An air mass moving to a colder region should become:
•	 More stable.
•	 Colder in the lower layers.
•	 Have an increased relative humidity.

Air Masses
Identification
Air masses are identified by temperature/latitude:
•	 Equatorial.
•	 Tropical.
•	 Polar.
•	 Arctic.
and by humidity or sea/land source:
•	 Maritime.
•	 Continental.
Air masses are classified according to moisture content, source or type and temperature using 
a 3 letter system:
1.	
First letter: moisture content. c(ontinental) or m(aritime).
2.	
Second letter: source region or type, E(quatorial), T(ropical), P(olar) and A(rctic).
3.	
Third letter: temperature, c(old) or w(arm).
Hence the 5 air masses affecting Europe are:
•	 Arctic maritime, mAc
•	 Polar maritime, mPc
•	 Polar continental, cPc
•	 Tropical maritime, mTw
•	 Tropical continental, cTw

Air Masses Affecting the British Isles and NW Europe
(Air masses affecting this area affect other parts of the world in a similar fashion.)
•	 Arctic Maritime (mAc)
Source: Polar ice cap, 
stable 
very 
cold 
and 
dry.  Usually experienced 
between 
September 
and May.  During the 
summer months mAc has 
characteristics similar to 
mPc so no distinction is 
made.
Weather: 
relative 
and 
absolute 
humidity 
increase significantly as 
the air moves down the 
Norwegian Sea and the 
air mass becomes very 
unstable.  Large CU and 
CB develop giving heavy 
showers of snow often 
with blizzard conditions.
•	 Polar Maritime (mPc).
Source: Northwest area 
of North Atlantic: stable, 
cold, absolute humidity low, relative humidity high.
Weather: Cold, moist, NW airflow. On approaching UK becomes unstable giving Cu, Cb, 
heavy showers, sometimes hail and thunderstorms. Cu, Cb most likely over NW coasts and 
inland in summer. Visibility good except in showers. Bumpy flying. At night inland the 
cloud dissipates, the clearing skies causing a low level inversion with stable air below - ideal 
conditions for radiation fog.
•	 Polar Continental (cPc).
Source: Siberia (winter only). Stable, very cold and dry.
Weather:
•	 If the airflow is mainly from the E via continental Europe, then very cold, very dry, no 
cloud, no precipitation. Becomes unstable hence good visibility.
•	 If the airflow comes over the Baltic or North Seas the air will become unstable, with large 
Cu and heavy snow showers on the E coast of Sweden and the UK. Remains very cold. 
Visibility good except in showers.

Air Masses
•	 In summer the air mass virtually disappears. However, with high pressure over Scandinavia 
in early to mid summer, there will be a NE flow over the North Sea to E UK. The air 
originates as dry, warm and stable. Over the North Sea it becomes moist and cool.
This results in Haar conditions over E coast of N England and Scotland - very low St, 
drizzle, advection fog, poor visibility.
•	 Tropical Continental (cTw).
Source: N Africa/SE Europe. Mainly summer, warm, dry, stable.
Weather: A warm, dry S or SE flow. No cloud or precipitation, warm or very warm. Visibility 
moderate except in dust haze which can occur.
•	 Tropical Maritime (mTw).
Source: The Azores anticyclone. Warm, stable, absolute humidity high, RH high.
Weather: A warm, moist SW air flow. As 
the air moves north, the temperature 
reduces (but remains warm). Stability and 
RH increase. Low cloud, St and Sc. Drizzle or 
light precipitation. Visibility poor. Advection 
fog over sea area late spring, early summer, 
over land winter, early spring. In high 
summer insolation and convection break 
down the stability resulting in clear skies or 
possibly a few small Cu.
•	 Returning Polar Maritime (mPw).
This is Polar Maritime air which has moved 
to the S of the North Atlantic & approaches 
from the W or SW. In its lower layers tropical 
maritime conditions are acquired and 
retained. In the NW Europe summer it will 
tend to give typical mPc conditions 
particularly by day.  In winter the conditions 
in NW Europe will tend to be similar to those 
of an mTw air mass.
Equatorial (mEw): Equatorial air masses do 
not affect Europe.  The weather associated 
with equatorial regions will be discussed in 
Chapters 19 and 20.

Other Areas
Polar Maritime (mPc) air also has a source in the other oceans in temperate regions. Tropical 
Maritime (mTw) air has sources in the other subtropical oceans. Polar Continental (cPc) air has 
a source in Canada which considerably affects N American weather.
Fronts, An Introduction
A front is a zone or surface of interaction between two air masses of different temperature.
When the two air masses meet, the warmer will rise over the top of the colder because of the 
difference in density. The frontal surface where they meet is frequently, but not always, active 
with much cloud and precipitation. The ground position of the frontal surface is shown on 
synoptic charts.
A front is usually only a few miles wide. If the term ZONE is used, then the region of interaction 
is much wider (up to 300 NM).
The main global fronts are:
•	 The Polar Front.
•	 The Arctic Front.
•	 The Mediterranean Front.
•	 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).
The Polar Front
The Polar Front is the boundary between 
polar and tropical air masses. In the Northern 
Hemisphere the polar front is found between 
latitude 35°N and 65°N.  In the North Atlantic 
the front extends from mid-Florida to SW UK 
in winter and from Newfoundland to NW UK 
in summer. In the N. Pacific the polar front 
is found in similar latitudes. In the Southern 
Hemisphere it is found between about 50°S 
and 55°S throughout the year.
There are numerous waves on the front which 
cause depressions which contain their own 
portions of the polar front.
The Arctic Front
The Arctic Front is the boundary between the Arctic and the Polar air masses and may have an 
associated jet stream. It lies at higher latitudes than the polar front but sometimes moves into 
temperate latitudes (south Greenland to north of Norway) in winter and spring. (See Figure 
17.8 and Figure 17.9).

The Mediterranean Front
The Mediterranean Front is the boundary between Polar Continental or Maritime air from 
Europe and Tropical Continental air from North Africa. It extends west to east across the middle 
of the Mediterranean Sea as far as the Caspian.
The front disappears in summer.
The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
The Intertropical Convergence Zone is the broad zone of separation between the air masses 
either side of the heat equator. The ITCZ is where the northeast and southeast trade winds 
converge. Subject to large seasonal movement overland, but much less over the sea. Sometimes 
known as the Thermal Equator or Equatorial Trough. The ITCZ is discussed in detail in 
Chapter 20.
Frontal Factors
Fronts in a locality are named warm or cold, 
dependent upon whether warm or cold air 
is replacing the other.  All fronts have a slope 
with height so that in side view the front is a 
sloping surface.
Whilst fronts are normally associated with 
convergence and ascending air, giving much 
cloud and bad weather, it is possible for air 
masses to flow side by side with little 
interaction. 
The  factors concerned are:
a)	
Equilibrium. The Pressure Gradient 
Force (PGF) is towards the front from 
both the cold and the warm side then 
under these  conditions the wind would 
be geostrophic, blowing parallel to the 
front.   The frontal surfaces would be 
in equilibrium with no tendency for 
the cold air to undercut the warm.
	
Figure 17.11 shows the equilibrium 
state where the polar front is parallel 
to the isobars with the geostrophic 
winds being parallel to the front.  In 
this case the front is known as a quasi-
stationary front.  These fronts are 
relatively inactive because there is little convergence

Air Masses
b)	
Convergence. There is always convergence in any depression but this will normally be 
small and give light precipitation and thin cloud only.   It follows therefore that there 
must be unbalancing of the equilibrium, causing lifting and undercutting of the warm 
air, for extensive cloud to occur together with heavy precipitation.
	
Unbalancing can be caused by the 
pressure falling in the depression. This 
will cause the winds to no longer be 
geostrophic and there will be a flow 
of air across the isobars towards the 
deepening centre.
The Polar Front and Polar Front 
Depressions
Polar and tropical air masses meet at a 
boundary which is called the polar front. 
This front is in temperate latitudes in both 
hemispheres and its position changes, particularly with the seasons. 
The portion of the polar front which particularly affects the British Isles is the Atlantic polar 
front.
Figure 17.13 The development of polar front depressions
The polar front is important because depressions form on the front and these contain modified 
portions of the front which provide much of the UK and European bad weather.
Depressions which form on the polar front (PF) are called polar front depressions. They form 
in families one behind the other.  The formation most frequently occurs on the tail of the 
depression cold front.  The portions of the front lying either side of the PF depression are 
called either warm or cold. Polar front depressions move parallel to the isobars in the warm 
sector and at a speed equal to the geostrophic wind speed measured between the two central 
isobars in the warm sector.

Warm Fronts
If warm air is replacing cold air, then the front 
is called warm.  A warm front is shown at 
Figure 17.14.
A 
warm 
front 
has 
an 
approximate slope of 1:150 
and a side view is as shown in 
Figure 17.15.
The front moves at right angles to itself at a 
speed equal to 2/3 of the geostrophic interval 
measured along the front.  See Figure 17.16.

Cold Fronts
If cold air is replacing warm air, then the 
front is called a cold front.  A cold front on an 
analysis chart is as shown in Figure 17.17
The slope of a cold front is 
approximately 1:50 to 1:80 
and a side view is shown in 
Figure 17.18.  A winter cold 
front in Europe will usually 
produce 
more 
intense 
weather and precipitation.
The front moves at right angles to itself at a 
speed equal to the geostrophic interval (full) 
measured along the front.  See Figure 17.19.

Quasi-stationary Fronts
When the front has little or no movement it is known as a quasi-stationary front. Figure 
17.20 shows such a front on a synoptic chart. Since there is little frontal movement, weather 
conditions are likely to be comparatively quiet, though longer lasting. The situation can be 
described as geostrophic as the front is parallel to the isobars.

The Warm Sector
The area lying between the two fronts is 
known, since it is covered by tropical air, as 
the warm sector.
Figure 17.22 The warm sector
The warm sector will move as the warm front 
and cold fronts move and will in fact narrow, 
as the cold front moves faster than the warm. 
The depression at the tip of the warm sector 
will move parallel to the isobars in the warm 
sector at a speed given by the distance 
between the first and second isobars.

Upper Winds in a Polar Front Depression
At the height of the jet stream (about FL300) the cause is directly related to the temperature 
gradient so the jet streams generally will be parallel to the fronts. The winds are:

Occlusions
Introduction
As the cold front is moving faster than the 
warm front the surface position of the cold 
front will eventually catch up with that of 
the warm front.  When this occurs we have 
an occlusion.  What happens next depends 
on the temperatures of the air ahead of the 
warm front and behind the cold front.
The position where the occluded front meets 
the warm and cold fronts is known as the 
point of occlusion or triple point.
Warm (Front) Occlusion
If the air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air behind the cold front, then a warm 
occlusion will be formed. With a warm occlusion the cold air behind the cold front rises over 
colder air ahead of the warm front.  This type of occlusion is most likely to occur in the winter 
months because  as the depression approaches the European (or N. American) coast cold 
continental air is drawn in ahead of the warm front.  In plan view the line of the occlusion 
follows the line of the warm front and the line of the cold front is discontinuous.

Occlusions
The warm sector is now raised off the ground and the cumuliform cloud at the cold front is 
pushed into the stratiform cloud at the warm front, giving the hazard of embedded CB.  Most 
of the precipitation in the warm occlusion occurs ahead of the surface position.

Figure 18.3 A warm occlusion
Figure 18.3 appears to show a cold occlusion but the only way to be certain about the type 
of occlusion is to check the temperatures ahead of the warm front and behind the cold front.
On Figure 18.3 at the station circle at 56N010W in the 10 o’clock position is the number “06”, 
this shows a temperature of 6°C at that location.  To the east of that position and the occlusion 
is another station circle (at Tiree) showing a temperature of 3°C.  So the air ahead of the

Occlusions
occlusion is colder than the air behind so it must be a warm occlusion.  Hence the diagram is 
correctly labelled
Cold (Front) Occlusion
If the air behind the cold front is colder than the air ahead of the warm front, then a cold 
occlusion will be formed.
With the cold occlusion cold air behind the cold front undercuts the less cold air ahead of the 
warm front.  This type of occlusion is most likely to occur in the summer months because the 
continental air being pulled in ahead of the warm front is warmer than the Atlantic air or 
Pacific behind the cold front.  Once again the warm sector is raised off the ground and we 
have the hazard of embedded CB.  Most of the precipitation is behind the surface position of 
the occlusion.  
 In plan view the line of a cold occlusion follows the line of the cold front and the line of the 
warm front is discontinuous.

Occlusions
Occlusion Weather
Weather is usually bad because the normal frontal depression weather is concentrated into a 
smaller horizontal band and therefore a mixture of clouds can occur, e.g. Cb embedded in Ns. 
Furthermore, an occlusion forms towards the end of the life cycle of a depression, when it is 
slow moving and hence the weather can last for a lengthy period of time.
The above situation applies more particularly to the warm type occlusion because of the wider 
precipitation belt and the fact that this type of occlusion is more frequent in European winters 
because of the effect of Polar Continental air from the east (rain ice is a particular hazard).
Occlusions can become non-active and then produce a little cloud and nothing more as the 
depression dies.
Back Bent Occlusions
As the occlusion forms, the first point of occlusion is at the depression centre. It gradually 
moves S and W forming a back bent occlusion rather like a loop through the depression centre. 
This back bent portion is usually some 100 - 200 NM long and gives a belt of rain in the cold air 
behind the cold front, often of a thundery nature.

Occlusions
Movement
The precise forecasting of weather and movement of the occlusion is difficult. The point of 
occlusion may be plotted for some time ahead by moving the warm front and cold front of a 
warm sector depression as described in the last chapter. Where the fronts meet will be the new 
point of occlusion. Figure 18.7 shows how this may be done.
‘
‘
Figure 18.7 Movement of the point of occlusion
Movement of the depression itself is much more difficult to predict, but it will curve in an 
anticlockwise direction (Northern Hemisphere) at a speed dependent upon isobar spacing.
Growth and Decay
Growth of a depression to the time of producing the lowest pressure at the centre is about 
4 days. The dying away as the depression fills can take 10 days or more and eventually the 
depression is absorbed by some other pressure feature.
For the British Isles, the time sequence typically involves:
•	 Formation and growth near the eastern seaboard of USA or mid-Atlantic.
•	 Lowest pressure, in central to eastern Atlantic.
•	 Depression filling over East Europe/Norwegian sea/Scandinavia - frontolysis, and eventually 
fill and lose their identity in central Asia or the Arctic Ocean.

Occlusions
Families of depressions form along the polar front and most frequently the new members form 
as secondary depressions at an occlusion point or at the end of a trailing cold front. This latter 
position particularly applies later in the life of a depression as the cold front crosses a coastline 
(e.g. the coast of Brittany) or a range of mountains.

Conclusion
The Handbook of Aviation Meteorology sums up the matter of occlusions thus:
‘The characteristics of the occlusion are variable. They may be similar to those of either the 
warm or cold front (according to type) but are often ill defined’.

Introduction
Polar front depressions predominate in temperate latitudes but other types of depression also 
exist, in temperate and other regions. These include:
•	 Orographic depressions.
•	 Thermal depressions.
Orographic (Lee) Depressions
When a flow of air meets a mountain range at a large angle, there is a marked tendency for 
much of the air to flow around the end of the range instead of flowing over the top. This 
can cause a comparative lack of air on the downwind (lee) side of the mountains so that low 
pressure occurs. Orographic depressions formed over N. Italy when a cold front comes from 
the north into the Alps can produce significant convective weather.  This is because the colder 
air of the front is now coming over the Alps above the warmer air to the south creating very 
unstable conditions.

There are three weather situations:
•	 If the air is dry and stable, then any uplift caused by the depression will have little effect and 
the weather will be warm, clear and dry. This is the Föhn effect.
Figure 19.2 Föhn effect
•	 If the air is moist, then the uplift caused as it passes over the depression can ensure that Cu 
and Cb with showers and possibly thunderstorms and hail may develop.

Other Depressions
•	 Sometimes a cold front will approach the mountain range and then much of the cold air will 
initially be held back by the range. When this unstable air finally breaks over the mountains, 
lifting will occur with additional lifting from the orographic low.
The result can be heavy banks of Cb, with line squalls, very heavy showers, thunderstorms, 
hail and poor visibility.
A good example of this occurs over the Alps in northern Italy in winter, the cold front being 
part of a polar front depression.

Thermal Depressions
Basic Theory
As the air at the surface is heated, it will expand, causing the pressure surface to be lifted.	
This higher pressure at height will result in an outflow of air. In turn this will cause a fall in 
surface pressure and the air will move cyclonically.
Figure 19.5 Thermal depression theory
The thermal depression often weakens with height because pressure tends to be higher. This 
can cause upper winds to reverse, but development of a thermal depression in unstable air can 
be active up to tropopause heights.
Weather.
•	 Cu, Cb (perhaps hail and thunderstorms).
•	 Heavy showers.
•	 Good visibility except in showers.
•	 Moderate or severe turbulence.

The Monsoon Low
Over large continents in summer a large thermal low develops which controls the circulation of 
air. The weather pattern is variable, being affected by topography, e.g. the Himalayas, and by 
the air masses drawn into the circulation.

Polar Air Depressions
These thermal lows form when Arctic Maritime air is subject to lifting on a large scale. This 
usually occurs due to the mAc air moving south over a warmer sea in winter. It gives Cu, Cb, 
heavy showers and sometimes secondary cold fronts develop. Do not confuse with polar 
front depressions which are at the joining point of the Tropical Maritime and Polar air masses.

Inland Waters
In winter, thermal lows develop over the Caspian, Black and Mediterranean Seas. A cold outflow 
of cPc air from the Siberian high flows over the warmer seas. Convection and the development 
of depressions result. Similar lows develop over the Great Lakes of North America.
Thermal Lows Over Land (Summer)
During SUMMER, shallow lows will appear over land due to surface heating. If the air is already 
UNSTABLE or there are OLD FRONTAL ZONES in the area, thunderstorms, widespread rain or 
squalls may result. Figure 19.9 shows such lows over central France producing thunderstorms. 
They also occur regularly in Summer over the American mid-west, giving heavy thunderstorms.

Tropical Revolving Storms (TRS)
Description
These are thermal depressions that develop over the warm tropical oceans and have sustained 
wind speeds in excess of 33 kt, they are designated tropical cyclones when the sustained wind 
speed exceeds 63 kt. They are the most destructive and extensive weather phenomenon which 
affects our planet. Winds in a tornado may momentarily exceed those of a TRS, but the life 
cycle of a tornado is primarily measured in minutes. The life cycle of a TRS, however, may be up 
to about 2 weeks and its size may match that of polar front depressions but has much greater 
intensity.
Figure 19.10 The segment of worst weather in a tropical revolving storm.
Formation:
Hurricanes are formed from complexes of thunderstorms, (usually the western side of the 
oceans). However, these thunderstorms can only grow to hurricane strength with the right 
conditions of the ocean and the atmosphere. These thunderstorms are most commonly formed 
in one of two ways. The main way being from the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where 
the easterly trade winds converge at the Equator creating a band of storms circumnavigating 
the globe. The second way is from the equatorial easterly atmospheric waves, otherwise known 
as easterly waves originating in NW Africa (see Chapter 20) These easterly waves give rise to 
the hurricanes in the N Atlantic and the NE Pacific.
The storms generate their power and energy from the release of large amounts of latent heat 
from the moisture they have gained over the warm seas. This release of heat causes the air to 
expand, further reducing the surface pressure. This creates even stronger convergence, which 
in turn causes more moist air to rise and cool to condensation, aiding the release of greater 
amounts of latent heat.
Requirements:
•	 Must be within 5 and 25 latitude. Below 5 Coriolis force is too small, above 25 latitude the 
sea is usually too cold.
•	 Ocean temperatures must be greater than 26°C. The higher the ocean temperature the 
greater the pressure drop within the core. This is the reason why we do not usually have TRS 
forming in the southern Atlantic because the sea surface temperatures are too low.

Other Depressions
•	 There must be a sufficient depth of warm water (200-300 ft) in the ocean to provide a 
continual energy source. If the depth of warm water is too shallow the storm would quickly 
drain the energy from the ocean and cease to develop.
•	 Very little shear must exist within the atmosphere, otherwise the storm would topple. This 
also has the effect of increasing the area over which the latent heat is released, thereby 
reducing the effect it will have on intensifying the storm.
Movement:
The path of a TRS greatly depends upon the wind belt in which it is located. Since most 
originate from the tropics, it follows then that the TRS will initially be driven westwards by the 
easterly trade wind belt at around 10 - 20 knots. Eventually the storms will move away from 
the Equator and increase in strength as a result of increasing Coriolis force. The subtropical 
highs and prevailing westerlies at these latitudes drive the TRS eastwards. At this stage the TRS 
have moved to higher latitudes where the seas are now too cold to feed energy into the storm 
and they will eventually die. If at any time the storm goes over land, the influx of moisture is 
ceased and again, the storm will die. Figure 19.13 shows the general movement of TRS around 
the world.
Stages of Development:
TRS evolve through a life cycle, from birth to death much like that of a thunderstorm. The 
stages are based upon the organization of the storm and the sustained wind speeds which 
they create. Not all of the stages will eventually evolve in to a TRS.
Stage 1
Tropical Depression
This is designated when the first appearance of a lowered pressure and organized 
cyclonic circulation in the centre of the thunderstorm complex occurs. A surface 
pressure chart will reveal at least one closed isobar. 
Stage 2
Tropical Storm
A tropical depression is designated a tropical storm when the sustained wind 
speeds exceed 33 kt. It is at this stage when it is assigned a name.
Stage 3
Tropical Cyclone
The system is designated a tropical cyclone, hurricane or typhoon, dependent 
on location, when sustained wind speeds are greater than 63 knots. There is a 
pronounced rotation around a central core which will eventually form the “eye”.
The Eye:
One of the most recognizable features found within a TRS is the eye. They are found within 
the centre having a typical diameter of 20 - 50 km. The tightening of the eye is a useful guide 
that the storm is increasing in strength. It is within the eye that we find the lowest surface 
pressures, and the calmest conditions. As air is forced up and outward from the storm some 
of it returns down the centre causing adiabatic heating which evaporates clouds creating the 
familiar clear column of air which distinguishes the eye itself. The air descending in the eye has 
cooled at the SALR in the clouds of the eye wall, but is now dry so is warming at the DALR. 
Hence the air in the eye is warmer than the air in the eye wall.

The Eye Wall:
This is where the most active Cb’s are found with the strongest winds and most severe 
turbulence.  In other words the most dangerous part of a tropical revolving storm.
Figure 19.11 Cross-section of a TRS
Names and Nicknames:
TRS are given different names in different parts of the world. Figure 19.13 shows the names 
and movements of these storms.
Within each region, and for each storm season, a series of nicknames in alphabetical order is 
devised, alternating male and female names, e.g. the first storm in this year’s season in the 
Caribbean might be called ‘Arthur’, the next one ‘Betty’ and the third one ‘Charlie’. Next year 
the series would start with ‘Annie’ followed by ‘Brian’ and so on.

Action to Avoid a Revolving Storm:
•	 In the Northern Hemisphere, if very high values of starboard drift occur, turn port or 
starboard until port drift occurs. The aircraft is then heading away from the storm.
•	 In the Southern Hemisphere, drifts are reversed.

Secondary Depressions
When a small depression is 
enclosed within the circulation 
of a larger depression it is 
called 
a 
secondary. 
The 
isobars need not show a 
closed centre. Secondaries 
are particularly associated 
with frontal depressions and 
form:
•	 On a trailing front from 
an 
occluded 
primary. 
This 
secondary 
may 
deepen and form the next 
depression along the PF 
and equal the size of the 
primary. At this stage, the 
depressions tend to rotate 
around each other, until 
eventually 
the 
primary 
and the secondary have 
become the new primary.
•	 On a trailing cold front well within the primary circulation. In this case, it appears only as 
a disturbance on the front, it moves along it without much development until it eventually 
becomes absorbed. Although producing little weather of its own, it may delay the movement 
of the cold front and make forecasting of frontal passage difficult.

•	 At the tip of the warm sector of a partly occluded depression. Formed at the Point of 
Origin or Triple Point, while the primary fills up. Often formed when primary and occluded 
fronts are held up by a mountain barrier as in southern Greenland or Norway. 
Secondary depressions move in a cyclonic sense around the primary depression.

fronts have occluded
Cold Air Pools
Cold air pools exist within cold air masses.  On Figure 19.17 the surface pressure is overlaid with 
a thickness chart which shows the vertical distance between the 1000 hPa and 500 hPa levels. 
On this presentation the thickness is colour coded with the scale on the right.  The thickness 
is given in decametres (tens of metres) so over the north of the UK the thickness between 
the 1000 hPa and 500 hPa levels is 524 decametres (5240 metres) or about 17 190 ft, these 
individual thicknesses are also known as isohypses.  In the ISA the thickness between these 
levels is approximately 18 000 ft so this indicates that a cold air pool exists over the UK.
The cold air pools can only be located by examining thickness charts or upper contour charts, 
where a low thickness or altitude indicates the presence of a cold air pool.  They cannot be 
detected on surface analysis charts.  Figure 19.17 shows the surface pressure distribution which 
gives no indication of temperatures.
The cold air pools may be quasi-stationary, as the one over NW Greenland, or transitory as 
those over UK and Novaya Zemlya.  
Cold air pools in the NW Atlantic and NW Europe are often found in the polar maritime air 
behind a cold front and an advecting cold pool would have a cold front at its leading edge. 
The weather associated with a cold pool will typically be convective especially over land in 
summer when thunderstorms can be expected.

Tornadoes
‘A violent whirl, generally cyclonic in sense, averaging about 100 m in diameter and with an 
intense vertical current at the centre, capable of lifting heavy objects into the air.’
(Meteorological Glossary).
North American Tornado. The synoptic situations giving rise to tornadoes in the USA are as 
shown in Figure 19.18.
Figure 19.18 Synoptic situation favouring tornadoes
The tornadoes will occur when cold dry air from the northwest meets warm moist air from 
the Gulf of Mexico over the  prairies of central USA in spring and early summer. 80% of 
tornadoes occur between 1400 and 2200 with peak incidence at 1700. The precise means of 
formation of the ‘twister’ is open to considerable conjecture, but computer modelling and the

Tornadoes are invariably associated with 
cumulonimbus clouds and in some cases the 
rotation extends to the top of the storm.
Destructive power of tornadoes lies in the 
localized reduction in pressure (20 to 200 hPa) 
leading to structures exploding and the very 
high (up to 300 kt) wind speeds in the vortex. 
Tornadoes usually last a matter of minutes, 
some occasionally last a few hours and move 
at speeds up to 40 kt. Figure 19.23 shows the 
appearance of tornadoes.
Increasing use of Doppler radars which will 
also measure particle speeds within the 
vortex is making local tornado warnings more 
reliable, but still not more than 30 min ahead. 
Tornadoes develop a typical ‘hook’ pattern on 
the radar screen. Figure 19.24 shows this radar 
‘signature’. 
Within Europe tornadoes are much weaker 
systems whose maximum diameter is of the 
order of 100 m - 150 m, but usually much 
smaller.
See Chapter 14 for more detail on tornadoes.

West African Tornado. West African tornadoes are associated with the passage of the ITCZ 
through countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea. They are thunderstorm squall lines which form 
in a line north-south and move from east to west between March and November and are most 
common from March to May and October to November.

Global Climatology
Introduction
We have now studied the various atmospheric processes associated with weather and how 
their interaction produces the different types of weather phenomena we experience.  Now 
we turn our attention to weather on a global scale and look at the weather we can expect in 
different locations.  This study is known as climatology.
The elements of climatology are precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine and wind 
velocity.
These elements will be affected differently across the globe by; latitude, location (maritime or 
continental), the circulation of pressure systems, altitude and geography.
Over the years climatological data has been accumulated to such a degree that weather 
forecasting on an area basis has become quite accurate and communications have improved 
to such a degree that weather expected on arrival at a destination (and the weather en route) 
may easily be obtained. This chapter will deal with climatology on a global basis and its regional 
and seasonal variations.
Idealized Air Circulation
The general air circulation is a very complicated system of air movements. These movements, 
while based on the passage of air from high pressure to low and the effect of the rotation of 
the earth, are complicated by:
•	 The unequal heating of land and sea together with land and sea disposition.
•	 Variation in land heating caused by different surfaces.
•	 The 23½° inclination of the earth’s axis which causes movement of the thermal equator. 
It is therefore useful to consider an air circulation which ignores these main complications and 
to use this as a basis for understanding the conditions which actually prevail. The idealized 
circulation assumes that the earth’s surface is covered with sea and that the geographic and 
thermal equators are coincident. In fact, since the surface of the Southern Hemisphere is largely 
covered by sea, climatology in that hemisphere very closely follows the idealized case.
Idealized Circulation Weather
With a uniform spherical earth, the temperature would only vary with latitude. Pressure at any 
given height over the Equator would then be greater than that at any height over the poles. 
Thus air would drift at height from the Equator to the poles, helping to produce high latitude 
anticyclones and causing a movement on the surface of air from poles to Equator.

Global Climatology
However, this cyclic movement of air would be affected by the rotation of the earth, and the 
circulation would be modified to that shown in Figure 20.1.
Anticyclones, 
formed 
by 
Hadley cells around 30° N and 
S, and known as subtropical 
anticyclones, would provide a 
surface outflow of warm air, 
some of which would move 
towards the nearer pole. 
This air would meet the cold 
anticyclonic flow from the 
polar regions, thus providing 
areas of frontal activity.
The Hadley cell and polar 
front, 
with 
the 
vertical 
airflows that cause them, are 
shown at Figure 20.2.
From 
the 
subtropical 
anticyclones 
in 
each 
hemisphere, surface outflow 
also 
occurs 
towards 
the 
Equator. This convergence 
causes rising air and much 
instability in the equatorial 
zone, and is known as the 
Intertropical 
Convergence 
Zone (ITCZ).
The earth’s climatic engine, 
the airflow pathways of the 
world, clearly demonstrate 
how 
the 
climatic 
zones 
of earth are interrelated. 
Moisture laden air rises along 
the ITCZ causing masses of 
cumulonimbus thunderclouds 
to develop giving rise to the 
heavy rains in the tropical 
regions. 
Upper 
air 
from 
the Hadley and Ferrel cells, 
indicated in Figure 20.2, meet 
and are cooled and undergo 
radiative sinking to produce 
the Subtropical High Pressure 
zones at the Earth’s surface giving settled weather.
The air streams separate here in the Northern Hemisphere , one flows south as the NE trade 
winds whilst the other flows north to become temperate latitude westerlies. The flow is 
mirrored in the Southern Hemisphere.

Global Climatology
The polar front is caused by cold air of the polar cell forming a wedge beneath the warmer 
Ferrel cell. Complex airflow patterns associated with the polar front are responsible for the 
vagaries in the weather of mid latitudes.
Basic Climatic Zones
The pressure distribution shown above gives us 4 basic climatic zones: (Figure 20.3)
•	 A warm, wet equatorial zone
•	 Warm, arid subtropical zones
•	 Cool, wet temperate zones, and
•	 Cold dry polar zones
To these we can add, in the Northern Hemisphere, a continental area over northern N. America 
and northern Eurasia.
The tilt of the earth’s axis means that these zones will move north in the Northern Hemisphere 
summer and south in the Southern Hemisphere summer adding 2 transitional zones. (Figure 
20.4)
Figure 20.3 World Climatic Zones
Figure 20.4 World Climatic Zones
Climatic Zones 
The climatic zones follow the classification system devised by an Austrian botanist, Wladimir 
Koeppens.  The system was revised in conjunction his student, Rudolph Geiger, around 1918. 
The system has since been extended to account for some smaller climatic effects, mainly in 
N. America. Whilst the classification system now runs to some 30 zones and subdivisions of 
the zones, we are only required to know the 5 basic classes plus the 2 transitional zones.  The 
knowledge required covers the latitudes of the zones and the typical weather expected in the 
zones.

Summary
The idealized weather described above will be modified by local topography and by the 
proximity of sea areas. The effect of these on temperature, density and pressure can have a 
marked effect on local climatology.
Seasonal Effect
Figure 20.1 assumes, apart from an all-sea world, that the sun’s sub point encircles the globe 
along the Equator in all seasons.
In practice, the earth’s polar axis is inclined at an angle of 23½° to the plane of the path that 
the earth travels through space during the year. This path is shown in Figure 20.5 and it may 
be seen that, while the sun’s sub point is on the Equator at the equinoxes on 21 March and 21

September, it is on the Tropic of Cancer (23½°N) at the solstice of 21 June and on the Tropic of 
Capricorn (23½°S) at the solstice of 21 December.
Figure 20.5 The orbital motion of the earth around the sun
Hence when viewed from the earth the sun’s sub latitude appears to move southwards from 
the Tropic of Cancer on 21 June to the Tropic of Capricorn on 21 December then northwards 
again returning to 23½°N the next June.
It may be noted that above 66½°N (the Arctic Circle) the sun is above the horizon 24 hours a 
day on 21 June and below the horizon 24 hours a day on 21 December. The reverse is true in 
the Antarctic.
In the actual world the seasonal movement of the thermal equator can produce tropical rains 
moving into the summer hemisphere; that is, north in July or south in January. We thus have a 
transitional region in each hemisphere between the subtropical highs and the equatorial low. 
Each will be subject to tropical rain in summer and to dry trade wind weather in winter. Near 
the Equator there will be rain nearly all the time, with maximum rainfall about the time of the 
equinoxes and minimum at the solstices.

Temperature and Topographical Effects
The surface temperature of an idealized all sea world would cool evenly with latitude increase 
because the sun’s elevation would reduce.  In practice this even cooling will be much modified 
by the presence of land masses, especially in the Northern Hemisphere where the continents of 
Asia and North America are vast.  One effect is that  the subtropical anticyclones do sometimes 
break down due to summertime land heating which lowers pressure.  Conversely, continents 
outside the subtropical high belt can experience wintertime land cooling which raises pressure. 
In January the temperature in Asia is exceptionally cold as shown below.  The winter cold air 
over central Asia is due to its distance from the sea, long nights and winter-long terrestrial 
radiation.  It will be held back from India and Pakistan to the south by the Himalayas.  In North 
America the cold is further enhanced by the Rocky Mountains which block warm Pacific air 
while the absence of a barrier to the north allows Arctic air to move south.  North Atlantic 
temperatures will remain comparatively high due to the warm water sea current from the 
Gulf of Mexico. Hence prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic will warm the adjacent land 
masses of UK and Western France.  Southern Hemisphere isotherms will be  near the  ideal due 
to the greater sea areas.
Figure 20.7 Average mean sea level temperatures in degrees celsius in January
In July, Central North America is warmed by air free to move north from the Gulf of Mexico; 
the vast area of Asia is warmed by the sun.  These continents are now warmer than the Gulf 
stream-warmed Atlantic so that isotherms are reversed, although contrasts are less than in 
January.  In the Southern Hemisphere the July winter reflects some seasonal ocean cooling 
but isotherms still equate approximately with latitude.

As distinct from seasonal variation, temperatures will also change daily, but diurnal change will 
be most in areas over land masses since it is in this circumstance that the sun’s heating effect is 
greatest.  The chart below shows the diurnal differences.
Figure 20.10 Diurnal range of temperature (diurnal variation)
Just as surface temperatures change more with departure from the Equator, so will 
temperatures aloft.  At the geographical equator the freezing level is 16 000 ft, although locally 
as high as 18 000 ft in July when the heat equator lies overland in SE Asia; because of this hail in 
thunderstorms would melt before reaching Mean Sea Level. Elsewhere in both hemispheres the 
freezing level change will be seasonally wider but especially so over land areas.  The following 
diagrams show the freezing levels in January and July.

Summary
Topographical temperature variations will affect surface pressure and distort the idealized 
distribution shown earlier, so that whereas the climatic pressure zones will be maintained 
over the oceans, the pressure patterns overland, and hence the winds and weather, will 
be governed much more by surface temperature changes.  This will apply especially to the 
Northern Hemisphere, where two-thirds of the world’s land masses lie.

•	 JULY
•	 In the Southern Hemisphere the pattern remains close to the ideal. Overland temperatures 
are colder thus the subtropical high is generally unbroken.
•	 The equatorial low pressure zone lies to the north of the Equator.
•	 Where subtropical highs would be expected in the Northern Hemisphere, low pressure 
areas now form over land masses due to solar heating. Thus the Siberian High of January 
is replaced by the Baluchistan Low, centred over Pakistan but affecting all of Asia. N 
America also has low pressure.
•	 The Aleutian and N Australia lows disappear.
•	 Icelandic statistical low pressure is less deep and is now dispersed into three small areas:
Off Greenland, the Baltic and Iceland - 1010 hPa
•	 The Azores & Pacific Highs are dominant at 1025 hPa

Surface Winds
The Westerlies of Temperate Latitudes
Westerly winds exist in the region between subtropical highs and temperate lows (40° - 60° 
degrees latitude). These are caused by the turning effect of geostrophic force (Coriolis) on the 
Poleward outflow from those subtropical highs. In the Northern Hemisphere the westerlies 
apply mainly over the oceans, with frequent winter gales. During the summer months these 
westerlies are less constant and less strong. In the Southern Hemisphere these winds are largely 
uninterrupted by land masses and are consequently strong. They are called The Roaring Forties 
- so called because they blow principally between latitudes forty and fifty South. Weather in 
this belt comes from rapidly moving depressions; wild weather, strong westerly winds and 
gales, overcast skies and heavy rain.
Figure 20.16 Prevailing surface winds in January
Underneath the subtropical high pressure zones the wind speed is relatively slow and sometimes 
nonexistent. The areas (between 30° - 40°N) have become known as the “Horse Latitudes” 
from the time when sailors en route to the Americas disposed of their horses off the ships 
rather than have to feed them when the sailing ships were becalmed.
Trade winds (Tropical Easterlies)
Trade winds are consistent winds converging to the equatorial trough from the subtropical 
high belt on each side of it. The turning effect of geostrophic force (Coriolis) causes northeast 
trades in the Northern Hemisphere and southeast trades in the southern. The trade winds 
blow towards the thermal equator and will therefore change direction when crossing the 
geographic equator. NE trades will back; SE trades will veer. January flow is shown at Figure 
20.16 and July flow at Figure 20.17. Fine weather prevails in the poleward and eastern parts of 
the tropical oceans while towards the west and the Equator unstable conditions will dominate, 
with cloudy, showery weather.

Monsoons. These are seasonal winds due to the winter high pressure, or summer low pressure, 
which develops over large continents. They are particularly marked in South and Southeast 
Asia and also occur in West Africa. They blow in concert with the trade winds.
Weather will depend very much on the track followed. NE monsoons over central India will be 
dry with little cloud, whilst the SW monsoon will be warm and moist with much convective cloud 
and heavy rain. NE monsoon over the Far East will be relatively dry whilst the SW monsoon, 
with its long sea track over the tropical oceans will produce very wet conditions.

shown at Figure 20.19.

•	 Strong easterlies near the South Pole. (Outflow from S Polar high turns left).

Weather
Temperate latitude depressions. Frontal 
depressions will breed along the polar front 
where this lies over wide ocean areas. In the 
Northern Hemisphere this will occur between 
35°N and 65°N across the Atlantic between 
N America and Europe, and a similar pattern 
will exist across the North Pacific to affect 
the west coast of N America. In the Southern 
Hemisphere polar front depressions will 
centre around 50°S in all seasons with fronts 
affecting the west coast of South America 
also New Zealand and the South Coast of 
Australia.

Polar Air Outbreaks. Found generally in wintertime, these are depressions affecting Central 
and North China as well as Central and Southern United States. Behind the cold front fresh 
outbreaks of very cold continental polar air greatly reduce mean temperatures. These winter 
mean temperatures are considerably below those of equivalent latitudes.

The Equatorial Trough / ITCZ
•	 The trough is centred on the thermal equator. High temperatures cause low pressure, 
particularly over land, with widespread lifting of air from the Trade Winds which converge 
below at the surface. This area is known as the ITCZ.
Figure 20.23 The approximate position of the equatorial trough
•	 The main feature of the ITCZ is extensive Cu, Cb & thunderstorms.  When stable air exists, 
there will be extensive sheets of As & Ns cloud and more continuous type rain
•	 The ITCZ can vary from 25 NM to 300 NM in width and there is no well defined frontal 
surface. Cloud is not caused by air mass temperature differences as at the polar front, but by 
convergence of the NE and SE trade winds which are normally the same temperature. The 
cloud tops are sometimes as low as 20 000 ft but more frequently 50 000 ft or more.
•	 Turbulence is usually severe, as is icing, which can be from 16 000 ft upwards.
•	 Vigorous and quiet  ITCZ cross sections are shown below.

Monsoons
•	 When trade winds blow to continental low 
pressure or from continental high pressure 
the associated weather is known as a 
monsoon. There are three monsoon flows; 
the NE, NW & SW.
	
	
	
	
	
	
•	 The NE MONSOON of Asia blows from the 
winter siberian high and is consequently 
cool & comparatively dry giving clear 
weather over Bangladesh, Burma and 
Thailand. SE India, Sri Lanka & east coast 
of West Malaysia are also affected by 
this monsoon, but here the over-sea track 
picks up moisture and produces heap 
type clouds and thunderstorms and 
heavy precipitation when crossing coastal 
mountain ranges.

Global Climatology
•	 The NW MONSOON is really an extension of the NE Monsoon which backs on crossing the 
Equator southbound and brings Cu, Cb and thunderstorms to North Australia & New 
Guinea. See Figure 20.27.
•	 The SW MONSOON is produced by the 
SE trade wind crossing the Equator and 
veering to SW and thence to the summer 
Baluchistan Low. Having a long sea track, 
this monsoon is very moist and produces 
much heavy Cu & Cb with large scale 
thunderstorms. It affects all of India, Sri 
Lanka, Burma and exposed coasts of West 
Malaysia. It has a more serious effect on 
flying than the NE Monsoon, with heavy 
thunderstorms, low cloud base & severe 
turbulence. The SW Monsoon also affects 
the West African coast, notably Guinea, 
Ghana & North Nigeria.
•	 In summary. The world’s rainfall is produced principally by the weather from the ITCZ and 
associated monsoons, also from the two cool temperate zones. The two subtropical high 
belts and two polar highs will usually be dry. Nevertheless these patterns may be altered 
significantly by local topographical features. The extremes of rainfall are indicated on the 
chart at Figure 20.29.

Upper Winds
•	 Subtropical Jets. These jets blow at the 200 hPa level in each hemisphere between 25° and 
40° latitude in winter and 40° and 45° in summer. The cause is the upper pressure gradient 
between the descending warm and cold air on either side of the subtropical high pressure 
belt. See Figure 20.30 and Figure 20.31. Speeds can be in excess of 100 kt. (Up to 300 kt 
near Japan).
•	 Polar Front Jets. The polar front jets in the Northern Hemisphere are of a transient nature 
and move with the polar front as it moves south in winter and north in summer. Polar front 
Jets are caused by the upper pressure gradient between the Tm warm and Pm cold air 
masses on either side of the polar front.
•	 In the Southern Hemisphere they are more constant and blow around the 50th parallel. 
They are less strong than those in the Northern Hemisphere.
•	 Tropical Easterly Jet (Equatorial Easterly Jet). Strong easterlies that occur in the Northern 
Hemisphere’s summer between 10° and 20° North, where the contrast between intensely 
heated central Asian plateaux and upper air further south is greatest. It runs from South 
China Sea westwards across southern India, Ethiopia and the sub Sahara. Typically heights 
circa 150 hPa (13-14 km; 45 000 ft). These easterlies can give way to westerlies especially in 
January as the ITCZ moves south.
•	 Arctic Jet Stream. Found between the boundary of Arctic air and polar air. Typically in winter 
at around 60° North but in the USA around 45° to 50° North. The core varies between 300 
and 400 hPa. It is a transient feature found over large continents during Arctic air outbreaks.

•	 High Level Winds Over India. With the onset of the SW Monsoon (May to June), large 
changes occur over India at the 200 hPa level. The axis of the westerly subtropical jet moves 
north of the Himalayas and the high level winds across India become easterly.
•	 Eastern Mediterranean. In the eastern Mediterranean in winter, subtropical jet stream 
winds occur particularly at the 200 hPa level. They are normally in the Cyprus/Egyptian 
Coast area with westerlies in excess of 100 kt. 225 kt has been recorded. (See Figure 20.32& 
Figure 20.33)
•	 Polar Winds. Near the poles there are strong westerlies in 
winter because the polar tropopause temperature is lower 
than that at temperate latitude. Remember - back to the 
wind - Northern Hemisphere - (low temperature on the 
left).
In summer, as the polar tropopause temperature rises and 
exceeds that at temperate latitudes, the westerlies reduce 
and become easterlies.
Waves
•	 Easterly Waves. An easterly wave is a wave 
or trough of low pressure, originating over 
West Africa between latitude 5° North 
and 20° North and moving towards the 
Caribbean. Some of the waves proceed 
beyond the Caribbean and into the 
Pacific. They occur during the summer and 
autumn, usually numbering about 50 each 
year. Weather produced will be like that 
associated with tropical revolving storms, 
though to a much lesser extent in severity. 
They may develop into tropical revolving 
storms themselves.

•	 Westerly Waves. These are very similar to easterly waves but are simply interconnecting 
warm front and cold front bands of weather (associated with a polar frontal depression) 
that move from the west to the east creating a pattern that is very similar to that of a wave. 
Figure 20.37 shows a typical westerly wave.

Local Winds and Weather
Introduction
The last chapter dealt with the general theory of climatology: this chapter deals with a number 
of winds around the world and the weather patterns associated with them. The winds are in 
five sections, Föhn type, Valley, some Mediterranean, Storm squalls and a West African wind.
Föhn Winds
Föhn 
Winds 
were 
dealt with in Chapter 
10 and the diagram 
explaining 
the 
resultant 
increase 
in 
temperature 
on 
the lee side of the 
mountain 
range 
is 
shown here.
Although Föhn winds 
blow in the Alps, 
the name is used 
generically to describe 
winds 
which 
blow 
with 
similar 
effect 
in other parts of the 
world.
One such wind is the Chinook which blows on 
the eastern side of the Rocky mountains of 
North America. Figure 21.2 shows the location 
of the Chinook.
The Chinook usually blows during the 
winter months and produces a rapid and 
considerable rise in temperature. A rise of 20° 
in 15 minutes is not unusual. The wind may 
blow for several days and snow on the eastern 
side of the Rockies may clear completely. The 
area covered runs from southern Colorado up 
to the Mackenzie Basin.

Valley Winds
Mistral
Valley winds are caused by air funnelling through a mountain gap or down a valley. The 
Mistral, which is a good example of such a wind, blows down the Rhône Valley between the 
Massif Central and the Alps to the French Mediterranean coast and beyond. It is usually a 
winter wind with high pressure over Central France and low pressure over the Gulf of Genoa. 
Temperatures are low with winter Mistral temperatures well below zero, flying conditions are 
turbulent and the winds are strong, 40 to 75 kt.
The Bora 
This wind is part valley and part katabatic. As Figure 21.4 shows, it blows down the north 
Adriatic with high pressure over Central Europe and the Balkans and a low over the Adriatic. 
The wind speed is around 70 kt with great gusts exceeding 100 kt in places. The Bora is 
strongest and most frequent in winter. Note: EASA examine this as a katabatic wind.
Mediterranean Winds
The Sirocco 
All three of the major Mediterranean winds we are dealing with are similar in that they blow 
ahead of frontal depressions tracking along the North African coastline. The Sirocco, which 
blows over Algeria is a hot and dusty southerly wind blowing out of the desert. This wind is 
usually a springtime wind and may last a day or so. Visibility may be reduced to below fog 
limits (1000 m). The Sirocco may travel as far as the French coast and in the process it may pick 
up moisture and produce low stratus, drizzle and fog.
The Ghibli 
This is a similar wind which blows over Libya.
The Khamsin 
Blows ahead of depressions tracking along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Conditions 
are similar to the Sirocco and the Ghibli. The name is also given to south or southwest gales 
blowing in the Red Sea.

Local Winds and Weather
Squalls
The Pampero
This is a severe windstorm blowing around the estuary of the River Plate (Uruguay and 
Argentina). It is a cold dusty south to southwest wind blowing behind a cold frontal 
depression. Stormy, gusty conditions prevail, with a considerable temperature fall after the 
storm passes. The squall is short lived, but the strong, steady wind may last for some hours. 
Pamperos usually blow in spring and summer

Sumatras
These occur in the Straits of Malacca (see Figure 21.6) blowing between southwest and 
northwest, most frequently between April and November during the time of the southwest 
monsoon. During the day thunderstorms build up over the high ground of Sumatra, assisted 
by the sea breeze, but at night the subsiding cumulonimbus clouds drift eastward under the 
influence of the land breeze and the katabatic effect. The storms are rejuvenated over the 
warm sea and violent storms result late at night and in the early morning. There is a sudden 
temperature drop as the squall passes through. Sumatras take on a pronounced arched shape 
as the Cb anvils spread out at the tops of the clouds.

The Harmattan
The last of the major local winds is the Harmattan. This blows mostly during the winter from 
the high pressure desert areas of North Africa as a northeasterly wind towards the ITCZ. 
(Northeast trade winds). The Harmattan is a cool dusty wind that may reduce visibility to 
below 1000 m, especially in areas bordering desert regions, such as Kano, Nigeria. The dust 
layer may extend to 7000 or 10 000 ft or more, and visibility improves towards the coast. The 
Harmattan blows from November through to April, though by this time the winds will be light, 
especially in the south.

Northwest Africa
Introduction
The region includes the area between the Mediterranean in the north, and the Nigeria - Ghana 
- Senegal coast in the south, that is between 35°N and 5°N and west of 10°E. It also includes 
parts of Ivory Coast, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Morocco, Mali and Algeria.
Geographical Considerations
The area is bounded to the east by the Sahara desert, centred near 23°N, which is a source 
of Tropical Continental air and brings much dust to the region. The cold Canaries sea current 
running south close to the Atlantic Coast helps advection fog to form.
Pressure Systems
The ITCZ (equatorial trough) traverses the southern half of the region bringing rain and a 
change of surface W/V as it passes. It is south of the coastal regions of Ghana and Nigeria 
in January, then pushes north to 18° - 20°N in July, thereafter moving south again, to clear 
the south coast by the next January. North of the ITCZ lies the Subtropical High. In winter 
it extends from the west across the Sahara desert and the surface outflow brings dry dusty 
conditions to all parts especially the south and west. Towards summer, the subtropical high 
and associated dry dusty conditions will be increasingly restricted northwards as the ITCZ 
advances from the south.
Weather and Surface Winds
It is convenient to divide the region into two areas split at the mid latitude of 20°N. The southern 
region includes Dakar on the west coast at 15°N.
South of 20°N - Winter Season
The ITCZ is south of the area. High pressure is dominant over the Sahara and there is no cloud 
or precipitation. The NE tradewind outflow from the Sahara to the ITCZ is extremely dusty 
and is known as the Harmattan. The duration of the Harmattan period decreases southwards 
because the ITCZ recedes southwards in Autumn then advances north in the Spring. Visibility 
in the dust is frequently down to 4000 metres and occasionally down to the fog limits. Outflow 
over the cold Canaries sea current favours advection sea fog, which can then drift inland when 
there is a sea breeze.

North of 20°N - Winter Season
High pressure over the Sahara and to the 
west can be modified by encroaching polar 
front lows and their associated cold fronts, 
which in turn bring onshore westerlies or 
Northwesterlies to the coasts of Mauritania 
and Morocco. Passing over the cold Canaries 
current this wind can bring cold fronts with 
low cloud and precipitation - the wet season. 
Cold fronts from the Mediterranean can also 
affect northern Algeria but are prevented from 
moving further south by the Atlas mountains. 
Elsewhere the prevailing NE Harmattan wind 
will traverse the area bringing dry dusty 
conditions.
At times outflow to the north will produce 
the dusty but dry Scirocco wind to the 
Mediterranean
South of 20°N - Summer Season
The ITCZ will advance northwards across the region during the Spring and with its passage the 
NE Harmattan will veer through east to become the SW Monsoon wind. The SW direction 
results from the SE trades which have crossed the equator and have therefore veered. The SW 
Monsoon brings the wet season with much CU, CB, heavy rain showers and thunderstorms. In 
the Autumn the ITCZ will recede southwards and with its passage the SW monsoon will back 
through east to become the dry dusty NE Harmattan once more. Note the surface W/V is 
easterly at each ITCZ passage.
North of 20°N - Summer Season 
The winter Sahara High has moved north 
to the Mediterranean. The outflow gives 
NE dusty winds flowing to the ITCZ to the 
south, and to beyond the west coast where 
advection sea fog can form over the cold 
Canaries current. This fog can then be drawn 
inland by sea breezes.

West African Tornadoes 
Tornadoes occur in the SE of the area over 
the Southern Nigerian valleys, where the 
air is moist and the surface heating strong. 
They are thunderstorms which form in a 
north/south line above the valleys as the 
ITCZ passes northbound in March/April, and 
southbound in September/October. The wind 
is temporarily from the east at these times and 
the storms are therefore carried westwards to 
affect other coastal countries before passing 
out to the Atlantic.
Upper Winds
Winter
The ITCZ with light easterlies aloft lies well 
south. Overland light westerlies will occur 
in the south increasing to the westerly 
subtropical jet of 100 knots or more over 
Morocco.

Summer
The ITCZ with light easterlies aloft affects the 
south of the region. In the north the wind 
will become light westerly only. Note that the 
subtropical jet has moved out of the area to 
Bordeaux.
Tropopause and Freezing Level
The tropopause averages 54 000’ and the Freezing level 15 000’ throughout the year.
North Atlantic Region
Geographical Area
The area considered reaches from 10°N to 70°N latitude and from the Caribbean and New 
York in the west to London and the Norwegian Sea in the Northeast. The area lies across the 
Disturbed Temperate and Subtropical High climatic belts. Figure 22.6 and Figure 22.7 refer.

Polar Air Depressions	 	
65°N - 55°N
Polar front activity is dominant across the disturbed temperate region. In the west, diverging 
air from the North American High moves SE over the sea to meet warm Tm air overlying the 
warm gulfstream waters flowing northbound off the N.American East Coast. This convergence 
causes much instability and the formation of depressions where the two air masses meet. This 
well-defined but erratic frontal line forms the western end of the polar front which in winter 
lies near SW Florida and stretches across the Atlantic. These depressions will be driven east/
northeastwards by the thermal mid latitude winds and will track along the polar front towards 
the UK and Norwegian Sea. Some of the lows will become slow moving and/or occluded 
between S Greenland and Norway, giving rise to the “Statistical” Low near Iceland as the 
depressions pass by.
In the eastern Atlantic the northeastward outflow from the subtropical Azores High will ensure 
that the travelling frontal depressions track to the Northeast, a typical winter landfall being 
SW England. See Figure 22.6.

Figure 22.6 North American weather details January
Over the Atlantic, the polar front will remain the boundary between mPc air to the north and 
mTw air to the south. As the travelling depressions develop, a portion of the mTw air will be 
increasingly trapped between areas of mPc air either side, forming warm and cold fronts. See 
also Figure 22.8.
North of the polar front, polar air depressions are formed by Arctic air moving south 65°N - 
55°N over relatively warmer seas causing instability weather.
Weather
The contrast between London and New York. Although New York is 40°N and London 52°N 
the winter weather is worse in New York. Why?
Cold continental outflow from the North American High becomes unstable over the adjacent 
but warmer sea forming low pressure. The resultant instability can then swing inland bringing 
snow to the New York area.
London in winter can also be affected by cold continental outflow - from the Siberian High. The 
difference is that such air will have a long land track and therefore will remain dry. Secondly, if 
the wind in London is from the prevailing west, it will be flowing off the Atlantic and therefore 
will be relatively warm, possibly giving rain but not snow.
Cloud
In the north of the region, cloud averages 6 oktas, mostly associated with travelling depressions 
and a cross-section is shown below.  Cirrus and stratoform cloud below the tropopause will

thicken down to near the surface preceding a warm front.  Extensive stratus/stratocumulus will 
occur as mTw air moves north over colder seas to the polar front and especially while trapped 
in the warm sector of polar front depressions.   Cumulus and cumulonimbus will occur on cold 
fronts with cumulus forming in the following unstable northwesterly air.  In the Caribbean the 
moist NE trade winds will produce orographic cloud and rainfall on windward slopes.

Icing 
Icing occurs widely and through great depth in convective and frontal cloud and is frequently 
moderate to severe.  Rain ice/freezing rain, in cold air below warm frontal air, can cause severe 
clear ice affecting airfields near Washington and New York.
Visibility
Radiation fog can occur inland especially in autumn and winter when pressure is high. 
Advection fog can occur when moist mTw air overruns previously cold-soaked inland areas 
especially in late winter/early spring.
Surface Winds
North of the subtropical Bermuda-Azores High, winds are generally westerly but locally easterly 
on the north side of depressions. There are frequent gales. In the south, NE trade winds prevail 
all year.
Upper Winds
These are generally westerly because their direction is governed by the thermal wind which 
blows with low temperature on the left. The average winter wind component from London 
to New York is minus 50 knots - locally winds can be stronger and if greater than 60 knots are

known as jetstreams. Over the Atlantic there are two distinct jet stream patterns – the polar 
front Jet and the subtropical jet. Each may reach 200 knots.
Polar Front Jet
This will normally blow from between NW and SW and occasionally outside this range, 
depending on the surface orientation of the polar front. With low temperature on the left, 
the warm front jet will normally be from the NW and ahead of a warm front and due to the 
slope of the front, some 400 NM ahead of its surface position. Similarly the cold front jet will 
normally blow from the south-west and some 200 NM behind the surface position of the 
front. Figure 22.7 and Figure 22.8 refer. The level is around 300 hPa (30 000’) and its average 
location is SW Florida to SW England is shown at Figure 22.6.

A pilot flying at high level from East to West across a polar frontal depression would

•	 Initially winds will be northwesterly giving strong port drift.
•	 Some 500 NM ahead of the warm front, jet axis speeds of 100-200 knots give increased port 
drift. This will last for 200 NM.
•	 Winds remain strong NW until crossing the surface position of warm front when winds will 
back sharply to west or south-west giving near-zero drift.
•	 Above surface position of cold front winds will back again sharply to Southwest giving 
starboard drift.
•	 After 100 NM enter the jet axis, speeds 100-200 knots, giving increased starboard drift. This 
will last for 200 NM.
•	 Passing out of the jet stream SW winds, starboard drift decreases.

Figure 22.9 Upper wind changes crossing polar front depression east to west
Sub Tropical Jet
This will be located close to the surface position of the Subtropical High (in the North Atlantic, 
the Azores High) and is caused by the temperature difference between the adjacent columns 
of descending air from the warmer Hadley cell to the South and the cooler Ferrel cell to the 
North. The wind will be westerly, blow at 200 hPa (39 000’) and in Winter be located between 
25°N-40°N. Over the N.Atlantic in Winter it blows from New York to Morocco as shown at 
Figure 22.6.
Summer
Pressure Systems
North American Low replaces Winter High. Icelandic “Statistical” Low 1010 hPa. Less deep and 
split. Azores High 1025 hPa intensified. Further North at 35°N. Hurricanes in Caribbean and 
Florida area. The polar front is still present but less active. The North American Winter High 
has disappeared and with it the east coast temperature contrast between land and sea. This 
part of the polar front therefore disappears in Summer and the western end starts at Labrador, 
Newfoundland, E. Canada where the advanced warm Gulf Stream sea current now meets the 
receded cold Labrador Sea current.
In the East, the Azores High is intensified and further North, thus pushing the Polar Front 
northwards to Scotland.
In Summer the Polar Front average position thus lies from Labrador/Newfoundland to North 
of Scotland to Norway. See Figure 22.10.
Temperature differences across the front are less, so frontal activity is less intense and less 
frequent. The weakened Icelandic “statistical” low is now split with average 1010 hPa centred 
West of Greenland, over Iceland and in the Baltic.

Figure 22.10 North Atlantic Weather details in July
Weather and Cloud
The New York Winter snows are gone. London temperatures remain moderated by air flow 
from the Atlantic. Polar air is less cold and the reduced temperature contrasts mean less 
convection cloud over the sea. From the Azores High warm moist mTw outflow northwards 
over cooler seas causes advection fog/stratus/stratocumulus and this can widely affect SW 
English coasts in late Spring/early Summer.
In the Caribbean the NE trade winds will continue to cause orographic cloud and rain on 
windward slopes. Additionally in Summer, rainfall will be increased by convection.
Visibility
Inland radiation fog is less likely in spring and summer and if formed, early morning insolation 
will cause quick clearance. Advection Fog can form over the cooler seas and near SW facing 
coasts of UK and France in late spring/early summer by mTw air from the Azores moving 
northeast. Near Newfoundland widespread advection fog can form over the Grand Banks 
(approx 45°N 50°W) in May/June by advancing warm moist air from the Mexican Gulf 
overrunning the very cold Labrador sea current.
Winds
In mid latitude, surface winds are still generally westerly but less strong than in winter, as are 
upper winds because the temperature differences are less. In the Caribbean, NE trade winds 
prevail at the surface.

Jet Streams
The polar front jet streams will still be around the 300 hPa level and be positioned in relation to 
the polar warm and cold fronts as in winter but will be less frequent, less strong, and displaced 
further north with the summer alignment of the polar front. The Subtropical Jet at 200 hPa will 
also be further north and in the latitude band 40°N-45°N.
Specifically across the Atlantic in summer, it will blow from Montreal to Bordeaux, as shown at 
Figure 22.5.
Easterly Waves
Easterly waves are similar to shallow troughs extending north from the equatorial low pressure 
belt. They move slowly east to west under the influence of the anticyclonic wind around 
the subtropical high pressure. In the North Atlantic autumn, West African tornadoes, which 
form over Nigeria, drift westwards with these waves and can become seedlings of Caribbean 
hurricanes.
Hurricanes
Hurricane is the name given to tropical revolving storms in the Caribbean/Gulf of Mexico area. 
Frequency of developed hurricanes is, on average, 3 per year. They occur from August to 
October, tracking westwards across the Atlantic near 10°N-15°N latitude and at 10 - 15 knots. 
Internal wind speeds can exceed 100 knots. They then cross the Bay of Mexico or turn right 
around the subtropical high to track NW, N, NE up the USA East Coast. They are energized by 
the latent heat of condensation and are therefore more active over the sea. Each season they 
are named alphabetically in order of occurrence using alternate male/female first names.

Continental Northwest Europe
Geographical Considerations
The mountains of Norway lie to the north while to the south there are many mountain ranges 
dominated by the Alps. Between the two regions lies the North European Plain with no 
mountain barrier against the Atlantic winds from the west nor to the cold winter winds from 
the east.
Winter
Polar Front Depressions
These move from the Atlantic towards Russia and principally between the mountain barriers 
to north and south although tracks are variable. Areas to the south of each low will experience 
frontal weather.
The Alps often block and delay cold fronts, causing frontal and orographical cloud to persist 
on the northern side. An active secondary depression may develop on such a front, tending

Area Climatology
to run east-north-east along the front until the cyclonic circulation around it eventually drives 
the front into the Mediterranean.
Thermal Depressions
Thermal lows can form in Winter to the east of the Alps over the low lying Danube area which 
is moist and comparatively warm. Associated cyclonic circulation on the east side will bring 
warm air north from the Mediterranean forming active warm fronts. These can bring extensive 
low stratus to Germany and snowfall as far north as SE England.
Polar Air Depressions
These can sometimes affect the extreme NW sea areas of the region in winter. (PL in Figure 
22.11)
Siberian High Extension
Pc air gives cold dry weather. Steaming fog or low stratus may be produced locally over water 
near German and Dutch coasts as the cold air reacts with the warmer water.
Temporary Highs
Ridges or transient anticyclones may exist in the N/NW in between travelling polar front lows.
Cloud and Precipitation
Cloud amount exceeds six octas on average. Cloud is frontal from the many polar front 
depressions also from warm fronts moving north from the Mediterranean although cloud 
amounts decrease from west to east.
There is much precipitation, in the East mainly of snow.
Visibility
Radiation fog can form inland with a slack pressure gradient, principally in autumn and winter. 
With a SW warm moist wind from the Atlantic, advection fog can form over previously cold 
soaked inland areas. Smoke haze may reduce visibility to the lee of industrial areas. Frontal 
fog can occur on the warm fronts of deep active polar front depressions.
Winds
Surface winds are generally westerly although easterly on the north side of depressions.
E or NE winds can occur as an outflow from the Siberian High.
Upper winds become increasingly westerly with ascent, due to the increasing westerly thermal 
component. Polar front jets, located in relation to the moving warm and cold front surface 
positions, and centred around 300 hPa/30 000’ are common and often exceed 100 knots. The 
subtropical jet is to the south near Morocco and therefore does not affect the region.

Figure 22.11 January weather
Icing
As over the North Atlantic, icing occurs widely and through great depth in frontal cloud and 
is frequently moderate to severe. Freezing Rain (Rain Ice) can cause severe clear ice in cold 
air under a warm front or warm occlusion. A rare occurrence in UK, it is more common over 
Central Europe where the ground is generally much colder, indeed the freezing level may 
frequently be on the surface especially in the east.
Summer
Pressure Systems
Polar Front Depressions
These will track eastwards as in winter but further north (seasonal movement is with the sun). 
They will also be less intense because of the smaller Polar/Tropical temperature difference that 
forms them.
Thermal Depressions
Strong insolation can cause active thermal depressions over France and Southern Germany. 
Thunderstorms are common when moist unstable conditions exist. Azores High. This is well 
established west of Africa at 35°N. An associated ridge across Europe often gives a limited 
period of fine dry weather.
Temporary Highs
Temporary ridges or transient anticyclones to the NW are more dominant in summer, in 
between weaker polar front lows.

Scandinavian Highs
These can persist for a few days drawing air across the North Sea from western Russia.
Cloud and Precipitation
Frontal cloud amounts and rain will be much less than in winter because the associated polar 
front depressions are fewer, less intense, and further north, and by summer the Mediterranean 
warm fronts are gone. Cloud is mainly convective in thunderstorms produced by thermal lows. 
Rainfall is therefore mainly in the form of heavy showers but the effect may be increased by 
orographic lifting in the southern mountains.
Visibility
Radiation fog is much less likely. It can occur in early spring but morning insolation will normally 
ensure quick clearance. In late spring/early summer an easterly wind round a Scandinavian 
High blowing over the North Sea can often result in extensive advection sea fog along the UK 
East Coast. In Scotland this is known as haar. It can travel inland some distance.
Figure 22.12 July weather
Winds
Surface winds are generally westerly but lighter than in winter. Winds may be modified by 
sea breezes along coasts.
Upper winds become increasingly westerly with ascent but the thermal wind component is 
less than in winter and upper winds will therefore be less strong. Reduced Speed Polar Front 
Jets will occur but further north with the summer movement of the polar fronts. The Atlantic 
subtropical jet will reach the coast near Bordeaux but due to mountain interference will not 
extend overland at jet speeds. It therefore does not affect the region.

Mediterranean Sea and Adjacent Lands
Geographical Considerations
The Mediterranean sea is almost entirely surrounded by land. Compared with the land, the sea 
will be relatively warmer in winter (giving unstable conditions above) and relatively cooler in 
summer (giving stable conditions above). Therefore during the winter surface air will tend to 
flow in from surrounding land areas and during summer it will tend to flow out.
There are significant mountain areas to the north and to the west. In winter, the mountains 
to the north will hold back much of the cold air from Europe/Asia. The high ground to the 
west will resist the advance of polar front depressions except via the mountain gaps in SW 
France and at the Straits of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco.
To the south there is no mountain barrier to prevent dry dusty air from the Sahara desert 
spreading north, except the Atlas mountains in the extreme SW.
Winter
Pressure Systems
Mediterranean Front Depressions
The Mediterranean front lies east/west along the centre of the Mediterranean, and is formed 
by inflowing cold cPc air from the north and inflowing less cold cTw air from the south. Air will 
be forced to rise along the convergence line forming frontal depressions in the west which 
move eastwards along the frontal divide driven by the westerly upper airflow. Because of the 
dryness of the desert cTw air, warm front and warm sector cloud does not form, thus there is 
cold front weather only.
Orographic or Lee Depressions
These can form south of the Alps over the Northern Adriatic and over the Gulf of Genoa. 
The Genoa Low can move south along the Italian coast giving unstable weather. Lee lows can 
form south of the Atlas mountains in Morocco with a cold W/NW airstream and then move 
NE to enter the Mediterranean east of Tunisia. They can also form south of the Turkish Taurus 
mountains to form the Cyprus Low between Cyprus and Turkey. The Cyprus Low gives not 
only instability but is accompanied by NE gales. Weak depressions moving into the area can 
become deepened and reactivated. These lows can then move eastwards into Lebanon and 
Arabia.
Siberian High
The Siberian High is well north of the region but its cold outflow can reach the warm 
Mediterranean and cause instability.

Area Climatology
Thermal Depressions
When cold air from the Siberian High flows over a relatively warm landlocked sea area such 
as the Mediterranean, instability or thermal lows are created. Over the Mediterranean, these 
form particularly in central and eastern areas and move eastwards to Arabia, the Arabian Gulf, 
Iran and Afghanistan.
Polar Front Depressions
Polar front lows and sometimes secondary lows can enter the region via SW France or Gibraltar, 
after which they tend to become absorbed by other depressions.
Cloud and Precipitation
Cold fronts associated with Mediterranean front depressions, also orographic and thermal 
depressions, produce CU and CB with attendant heavy rain or hail showers and thunderstorms. 
There is some layer type cloud and more continuous rain in association with the few polar front 
depressions in the west.
Visibility
Radiation Fog is less common than in NW Europe but can be persistent in the Po Valley in 
North Italy. Otherwise visibility is excellent between showers except when air blows from the 
south bringing dust laden air from the Sahara desert. These southerly winds, called the Sirocco 
in Algeria, the Chili in Tunisia, the Ghibli in Libya and the Khamsin in Egypt blow ahead of 
depressions travelling east over the sea.
Surface Winds
Surface winds will blow in accord with the location of depressions but there are some named 
winds blowing into the Mediterranean from surrounding land areas that should be noted:
Mistral
This is a strong northerly wind up to 70 kt blowing down the Rhône valley in SE France, 
especially when high pressure is to the north. It is a valley wind, normally stronger at night 
and in winter, which brings cold air from the north. It helps form the Genoa orographic low.
Bora
This is a stronger dry gusty NE wind up to 100 kt which is part valley/part katabatic. The wind 
blows through the mountain passes into the Northern Adriatic and can be reinforced by high 
pressure to the NE. It can bring snow and is strongest at night.
It can set in suddenly and is therefore dangerous. It can help form the Adriatic orographic low. 
Gregale
This is similar to the Bora but less strong, further south and more moist. It blows from the NE 
near southern Italy and Malta and is due to continental relatively high pressure to the north, 
and low pressure over the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs in 1-2 day spells in association with 
Mediterranean depressions to the south which are moving eastwards.
Sirocco (or Scirocco)
Blows out of Algeria and the Sahara Desert into the western Mediterranean ahead of travelling 
Mediterranean lows, and can carry dust up to 10 000’. The Sirocco can sometimes continue 
northwards to France; while in transit it will be cooled and humidified by the sea and can thus 
cause advection fog and/or low stratus along the South French Coast.

Khamsin
Similar to the Sirocco, but further east, the Khamsin originates in Northern Sudan, blows 
from the south through Egypt and can affect Jordan, Syria and Cyprus. Dust can be carried to 
10 000’.

Vandevale
Strong SW to W wind in the Straits of Gibraltar. Blows ahead of a polar front cold front 
approaching from the Atlantic. It is very squally with much low cloud.
Upper Winds
In the extreme west a few polar front jet streams occur in association with PF lows. The 
Subtropical jet over Morocco does not affect the west of the sea area but can affect the 
eastern Mediterranean in the Cyprus and Egypt region. It is centred at the 200 hPa level with 
maximum westerly winds at over 100 kt.

Icing
Clear ice can occur in convective cloud and thunderstorms. Freezing rain/rain ice can occur over 
N Italy where the freezing level may occasionally be on the surface.
Summer
Pressure Systems
Azores High
The Azores subtropical high at 35°N extends eastwards across the Mediterranean. 
Thermal Lows
Pressure over Egypt, Lebanon, and lands to the East is relatively low due to intense insolation.
Cloud and Precipitation
There is little cloud aside from fair weather CU. Local CU/CB can occur over the high ground 
of Greece, Italy and Turkey due to convective and orographic uplift, possibly resulting in local 
thunderstorms.
Visibility
Trapped near the surface by generally descending air, dust can reduce visibility across the 
region. In the straits of Gibraltar, warm moist air flowing out over the cooler Atlantic can 
produce advection fog or low ST/SC.

Surface Winds
Levanter
Summer outflow from the Mediterranean occurs at Gibraltar and is called the Levanter. It 
blows from the east (the Levant) during July-October and March and can reach gale force. 
The axis of the Rock of Gibraltar is north/south and orographic uplift on the east side through 
some 1100’ can produce a banner of ST/SC which then streams westward from the top of 
the Rock. In stable air standing waves can occur over the Rock. Considerable turbulence up to 
5000’ can exist above the adjacent airfield.
Etesian
This moderate persistent wind blows from the north across the Greek Islands of the Aegean 
Sea towards the island of Rhodes then southwards. It is caused by the pressure gradient 
between the Azores ridge, extending across the western and central Mediterranean, and heat 
induced low pressure overland to the east. The wind is dry and brings clear skies and good 
visibility. Strong Etesians can bring gales and affect the area from W Greece to W Turkey and 
as far south as the N African coast when CU may develop after the long sea track.
Sea Breezes
These can be strong at this time of the year and will locally modify surface wind direction.
Upper Winds
Light westerly in the west. Westerly average 40-50 knots in the east. Both jet streams are out 
of the region to the north.
Icing
The freezing level is high and icing is not normally a problem in summer.

Arabia, the Gulf Area, Arabian Sea and Borders Enclosed within 
15°N-35°N And 35°E-75°E 
Geographical Considerations
Inland areas of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Oman are largely desert. The Tropic of Cancer at 23½° 
N almost bisects the region so that in summer the noon sun is virtually overhead. The daytime 
interior is extremely dry and hot. The warm Gulf waters cause oppressive humidity along 
coasts. Surface wind direction is generally governed in the west by the NW/SE axis of the 
Zagros mountains in W. Iran and in the east by the Himalayas.
Figure 22.17 Arabian weather - winter

Pressure Systems
The Siberian High is established over Asia to the NE but its surface outflow affects the region. 
Thermal Lows, often with associated cold fronts, travel eastward from the Mediterranean 
across Arabia into Iran and Afghanistan.
Siberian dry cold frontal air passing over the relatively warm Caspian Sea to the north can 
initiate considerable thermal instability.

Cloud and Precipitation .
Restricted to the north and west only. Travelling lows from the Mediterranean will produce 
CU/CB, heavy showers and thunderstorms, and their associated cold fronts may bring some 
weather and duststorms to the more southern interior of Arabia. Thermal instability over the 
Caspian Sea can bring thunderstorms, hail and possibly snow to high ground to the north.
Surface Winds. 
In the west the Zagros mountain range and parallel ridges are oriented NW/SE. These block and 
deflect the cold Siberian outflow so that the surface winds become north or northwesterly. In 
the east, the Siberian outflow escaping round the western end of the Himalayan air block will 
again be northerly. The exception is the temporary southerly wind which occurs ahead of the 
travelling depressions from the Mediterranean.
Visibility. 
Winter visibility is generally much better than in the summer convection currents, but in the 
NW of the region rising dust can occur with any wind direction and especially in the southerly 
winds ahead of the travelling ex Mediterranean Lows. Violent but short lived duststorms may 
accompany the passage of associated cold fronts. Overland near coasts where humidity is 
high, radiation fog may form, but dispersal is quick after sunrise.
Upper Winds 
Are westerly. The 200 hPa subtropical jet covers the west of the region and may extend as low 
as 300 hPa (30 000’). Core speeds frequently exceed 100 knots.
Icing is not a problem except when climbing or descending through large CU/CB.
Summer
Pressure Systems.
The Baluchistan Low is the lowest pressure point of general warm weather low pressure over 
the Asian continent. It centres on the area of Baluchistan, lying across the Iran/Pakistan border, 
due to the mainly south-facing rocky nature of the surface, and intense solar heating from the 
high noonday sun.
The ITCZ just reaches Oman in the west. In the east it traverses the N. Arabian Sea northwards 
in June/July and southwards during September.
Thermal Low Pressure. Over Eastern Pakistan and NW India, March to June is dry. With 
advancing spring, the land mass begins to warm, thus pressure begins to fall, drawing in warm 
moist air from the Arabian Sea in response to the pressure gradient; first at lower latitudes 
then progressively further north. The ITCZ follows.
Cyclones occur over the Arabian Sea during the advance and retreat of the ITCZ between 
June and September.
Surface Winds 
In the west  there will be anticlockwise rotation around the Baluchistan Low, as modified by 
the Zagros mountains with a NW/SE orientation, gives a northerly or northwesterly winds. 
In particular the shamal wind originates as dry and dusty convection currents from Iraq.  It 
is northwesterly and blows the length of the Gulf picking up moisture and bringing a dusty 
humid wind to facing coasts around Bahrain and Dubai.

Cloud and Precipitation
Most of the region is almost rainless and temperatures can exceed 50°C. Inland areas are very 
dry but Gulf coastal regions facing the N/NW onshore winds can be oppressively humid. An 
exception is the SE of Oman. The ITCZ reaches the coast where the desert terrain temporarily 
“bursts into bloom”. Further east towards the Indian coast, the ITCZ northward movement 
is followed by the onset of the SW monsoon. The monsoon is very moist and convectively 
unstable. Orographic and convection cloud and heavy rain are widespread.
Visibility.
The north/northwesterly winds can cause much dust in the desert regions. The shamal will 
bring dusty moist air to coastal areas. Visibility will also be reduced in regions affected by the 
ITCZ.
Upper Winds. 
Above 20 000’ winds are light easterly.
Icing. 
Icing should not be a problem in summer.

Route Climatology
Calcutta to Singapore
Geographical Considerations
The route is located between latitudes 23°N and 01°N. It overflies the eastern Bay of Bengal 
and is just off the west coast of Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand and W. Malaysia. The Himalayas 
lie to the north of low lying Bangladesh. The Cameron Highlands form a spine the length of 
West Malaysia, and Sumatra Island to the SW also has a mountain backbone.

Pressure Systems
Continental outflow from the Siberian High establishes the NE Monsoon over the whole 
route as shown in Figure 23.1. The ITCZ is south of the route.
Weather
In winter the route weather is generally very good. Calcutta and Bangladesh are protected 
from the north by the Himalayas. Abeam Burma, the NE monsoon will have had a long land 
track and, although isolated convective cumulus are possible, the dry cold air will in general 
ensure clear skies.
Further south the monsoon will cross the Gulf of Thailand picking up warmth and moisture 
encouraging some CU and CB to form over the isthmus of southern Thailand.
On the last section of the route the NE monsoon arrives warm and moist from the expanse of 
the South China Sea giving large scale orographic cumulus and thunderstorms over the east 
coasts and central highlands of West Malaysia and Sumatra.
The West Coasts are more sheltered and generally less wet although all equatorial land 
areas including Singapore have considerable convective heating resulting in almost daily 
thunderstorms.
Visibility
Early morning mist can occur in the moist river delta regions of Bangladesh and Burma. 
Otherwise visibility is very good outside showers and thunderstorms.
Winds
Low level winds are northeasterly over the whole route under the influence of the NE monsoon. 
Above 20 000’ upper winds overrun the monsoon. The 200 hPa subtropical jet lies just south of 
the Himalayas and is therefore north of the route; decreasing westerlies of around 40 knots over 
Calcutta reduce to zero near 10°N thereafter becoming the normal light equatorial easterlies.
Icing
Icing can occur above 16 000’ but is a lesser problem in January than July as skies are generally 
clear on the route.

Pressure Systems
The Siberian High of winter has been replaced by the Asian Low centred over Baluchistan. 
The ITCZ rapidly traverses the route northbound in spring to be by Singapore in March and 
Calcutta in May, then again southbound in the autumn to be by Calcutta in October and 
Singapore again in November/December. In July it is therefore located well to the north. The 
inflow to the ITCZ cyclonically round the Asian Low establishes the SW monsoon as shown at 
Figure 23.2. The monsoon is supplied from the Southern Hemisphere SE trade winds which 
veer to SW on crossing the Equator.
The lengthy equatorial sea track of these winds ensures high temperatures and high humidity 
so that wherever they landfall, the orographic uplift will trigger intense instability with 
thunderstorms and severe weather.
Weather
In summer, flying conditions are poor. The whole route lies on the windward side of the 
Bangladeshi, Burmese, Thai and West Malaysian coasts. Thunderstorms and severe weather 
will occur throughout except over the extreme south of the route, where in the Straits of 
Malacca there will be some protection by the mountains of Sumatra from the SW monsoon. 
Nevertheless the high mountains on either side of the straits can cause a new hazard.
At night, the katabatic winds from each side, aided by the land breeze effect, will meet in the 
middle of the straits causing a convergence line with consequent uplift. Along the straits this 
double sided uplift can cause a line of night time thunderstorms arched in the middle, known 
as Sumatras. (Jingle: Sumatras occur in Summer).
Cyclones
Tropical revolving storms are known as cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. To form they need a 
summer warm sea (evidence suggests in excess of + 27°C) and the close instability of the ITCZ. 
In July the ITCZ is north, over the land, so that in this area they form only in early and late 
summer when the ITCZ is over the sea, that is in June or October. Tropical revolving storms also 
occur in the Gulf of Thailand and occasionally move west to affect the route.
Visibility
Visibility is generally impaired by much cloud and frequent rainfall. Reduction in tropical 
rainstorms can be considerable.
Winds
Surface winds are SW over the whole route. Aloft, the 200 hPa subtropical jet is now located 
north of the Himalayas thus above 20 000’ the equatorial mostly light upper easterlies apply 
over the whole route. Also in this region, summer high temperatures in the land mass of Asia 
cause a reversal of the south-north temperature gradient. Aloft, with warm air to the north, 
the upper pressure gradient movement is southward, which Coriolis/GF will turn to the right, 
giving a pronounced easterly jet over Rangoon of 70 knots centred near the 150 hPa level 
(45 000’).
Icing
Icing can be a problem on this route during the summer, when descending through cumulo-
form clouds.
Tropopause Heights average 56 000’ all year.
Freezing Level Heights average 16 000’ all year.

Singapore to Tokyo via Hong Kong
Geographical Considerations
The route traverses the “Western Pacific Rim” from latitude 01°N to 35°N. It passes close to 
the east coasts of W. Malaysia, Vietnam and China. The en route weather is dominated by the 
changing seasonal pressure over Asia and the temperature differences between continent 
and ocean and between sea currents. East of Japan, the cold Oyasiwo sea current sweeps 
down from the Russian Kamchatka peninsula, and is countered by the warm Kurosiwo sea 
current flowing northeastward from the Northern Philippines. Much of the area, including 
Japan, has a mountainous interior.

Pressure Systems
The ITCZ lies well south of the route.
The Siberian High is well established to the west over Asia. 
Some polar front lows traverse the extreme north of the region. 
Surface Winds
Clockwise outflow from the Siberian High establishes the wind flow over the route as shown 
in Figure 23.3. From Singapore to Vietnam the NE monsoon blows. From Vietnam to China 
the wind remains north or northeast. Near Japan the wind is north or northwest.
Weather
In the south of the route, the NE monsoon sweeps down from the warm expanse of the South 
China Sea producing intense convective instability. This will produce CU, CB, heavy showers 
and thunderstorms along any windward coast in its path, for example the east/NE coasts of 
W. Malaysia and Vietnam. Inland areas, sheltered by mountains, will remain drier aside from 
convective weather.
Towards Hong Kong, after the ITCZ has passed southbound in September, some shelter will 
be afforded from north/NE winds by the Chinese mountainous landmass; from October to 
December the weather in Hong Kong is fine and dry. A change occurs in January as the wind 
veers and the source area is over the warm Kurosiwo sea current. These new warm moist winds 
form, over seasonally cooled coastal Hong Kong waters, advection fog, low stratus drizzle 
and gloomy conditions. This coastal condition is known as the Crachin and lasts in Hong Kong 
from January to April after which the northward movement of the ITCZ will dispel it.
In the north of the route very cold dry SE ward outflow from Siberia crosses the comparatively 
warm Sea of Japan. Moderate instability generated is orographically enhanced over the 
Japanese NW coast and central mountains causing CU and heavy snow showers. Eastern lee 
areas, such as Tokyo, will be drier and less cold due to the Föhn effect and warming from the 
Kurosiwo sea current.
Visibility
In the south of the route, visibility is good between showers. At Hong Kong visibility is excellent 
October-December, but abysmal from January-April in the Crachin conditions discussed 
above. Near Tokyo and other big Japanese cities visibility can be reduced to near fog limits by 
industrial smoke.
Upper Winds
Equatorial 10 - 30 kt easterlies blow from Singapore to 10°N. Further north, winds become 
westerly increasing in speed towards 25°N-40°N where the 200 hPa subtropical jet blows, 
frequently up to 150 knots, and occasionally to 300 knots near Japan. This exceptional speed is 
due to a combination of the strong low level geostrophic southeastward Siberian outflow and 
the extreme thermal wind component generated by the marked Siberia/Pacific temperature 
difference. Further north, there are some occasional westerly jets in association with polar 
front lows.

Pressure Systems
Baluchistan Low
The Winter Siberian High is replaced by the Summer Asian Low centred over Baluchistan. Its 
anticlockwise inflow produces the SW monsoon over the route as far north as Central Japan 
- the northern limit of the ITCZ.
ITCZ/Equatorial Trough 
The SW monsoon will follow northwards the ITCZ which will be over Singapore in March, China 
in May and Japan in July. The northern extent of the SW monsoon will then recede southwards 
again driven before the ITCZ, which passes Hong Kong in September and Singapore again in 
November/December.
Typhoons
In the North Pacific, tropical revolving storms are known as typhoons. Evidence suggests that 
to form, requirements include a sea temperature greater than +27°C, a proximity to ITCZ 
instability, plus a displacement away from the Equator where Coriolis is zero, and location 
south of the jet stream belts which would destroy their vertical continuity. They form in the 
central Pacific, at around 10°-15°N then drift westward at 10-15 knots with the clockwise wind 
direction around the N. Pacific subtropical high. Nearing the Philippines they will generally 
track near the seasonal ITCZ but can curl northwards extending the season in some locations. 
Up to 12 per year can affect southern Japan, principally in July - September and in Hong Kong 
occurrence is commonly in September. The overall season may extend from May to November 
depending on latitude. The southern limit is the Gulf of Thailand.
Surface Winds
In July the southwest monsoon extends over the whole route as far north as Central Japan 
where the ITCZ then lies. By late summer, the cold northwesterlies will re-establish behind 
the retreating ITCZ as the Siberian High begins to rebuild. Where typhoons occur, winds of 
varying direction may exceed 100 knots. Sea breezes will affect coastal wind direction in sunny 
conditions especially in the south.
Weather
To the west of Singapore in the Malacca Straits, the Katabatic thunderstorm Sumatras will form 
overnight. The SW monsoon will bring orographic CU CB to SW facing coasts, while east coasts 
will be more sheltered.
Nevertheless in these equatorial regions including Singapore purely convective cloud will be 
heavy, often giving daily thunderstorms.
Most route weather arises on the ITCZ as it travels from Singapore in March to Tokyo in July 
and back to Singapore in November/December. The northbound ITCZ will pass China in May 
where associated precipitation is known as the Plum Rains.
High typhoon internal wind speeds, coupled with intense rain and thunderstorms, can locally 
bring much structural damage and flooding.
Over Japan in late summer some frontal rain occurs as cPc air spreading south from Siberia 
meets retreating tropical air.

Visibility
In early summer, warm moist SW monsoon winds, advancing north, can bring sea fog to 
cooler Chinese coastal waters and extensive blanket advection sea fog over the cold Oyasiwo 
sea current between eastern Japan and the mainland Kamchatka peninsula further to the 
northeast. Some industrial smoke can occur near cities in Japan.
Upper Winds
Equatorial light easterlies of 10-30 knots extend to 25°N, beyond which winds become light 
westerly. Subtropical and polar front jets are little in evidence over the summer North Pacific.

Singapore to Auckland via Darwin and Sydney 01°N - 37°S    105° - 175°E
Geographical Considerations
The route crosses the Equator just south of Singapore then overflies the Java sea and many of 
the Indonesian islands. Next is the Timor Sea followed by the Central North Australian coast 
at Darwin, at latitude 12°S. From Darwin the route crosses the dusty largely flat Australian 
interior to the mountainous SE coast at Sydney, latitude 34°S. The last leg then heads across 
the Tasman Sea to New Zealand’s low lying Auckland airport at 37°S.

Pressure Systems
ITCZ 
The ITCZ is in the Northern Hemisphere well clear of the route.
Thermal Lows
Convective thermal lows will occur over the Indonesian islands. These are formed by a 
combination of island insolation and high humidity from the surrounding sea.
Subtropical High
The Australian interior in winter lies in the Southern Hemisphere Subtropical high belt. Relatively 
cool seasonal temperature overland will reinforce high pressure within the continent.

Polar Front Depressions
Travelling polar front lows in the Southern Hemisphere’s disturbed temperate zone will 
themselves be located well south of the route; but associated troughs, and secondary lows, 
can bring frontal weather as far north as the Australian South Coast and to New Zealand. 
As in the Northern Hemisphere, these eastward-travelling fronts will alternate with temporary 
ridges and anticyclones. Cold frontal activity can be quite severe from Sydney to Auckland.
Surface Winds
The SW Monsoon Wind at Singapore will soon back to SE (Coriolis change), as the route 
crosses the Equator. These SE “trade” winds will remain as far as Darwin and beyond although 
at Darwin itself strong local sea breezes may blow from the north. On the Darwin to Sydney 
sector the SE trade winds gradually veer to southwesterly to conform with the anticlockwise 
rotation round the Central Australian winter high.
Towards Sydney, and beyond to Auckland, the wind direction will locally be governed by the 
location of the travelling polar front depressions to the south but be generally westerly. South 
of the Australian land mass, these westerlies will encircle the globe largely unimpeded by land 
and will therefore strengthen. Here they are known as the ‘Roaring Forties’ from the principal 
latitude band in which they blow.
Sea breezes can affect Sydney even in winter.
Visibility
Between frequent equatorial showers over Singapore and the Indonesian islands, visibility will 
be good until near 05°S beyond which there will be haze caused by the dry dust laden SE trade 
wind blowing from Australia.
Beyond Darwin, the dusty outflow from the interior will maintain haze. Near large cities 
visibility may be reduced to 1-2 km by industrial smoke haze.
Over the two islands of New Zealand, the clear air gives good visibility in between cold 
frontal precipitation.	 Radiation fog can occur inland, especially over the colder South Island. 
Advection/sea fog can occur off the South Island east coast over the cold Antarctic Drift sea 
current.
Cloud and Precipitation
Daily convective CU with showers over Singapore and the Indonesian Islands will give way to 
quieter weather towards Darwin. The anticyclonic Australian interior will be dry but, rising 
over the mountainous east coast, the onshore SE trade winds can give orographic cloud and 
rain. The Sydney area and Tasman Sea route are affected by the disturbed temperate region 
lows to the south. They are thus crossed by fronts which bring moderate to heavy precipitation 
interspersed with highs giving several days of cool fine weather.

Figure 23.8 Upper winds - July (Winter)
Upper Winds
Above Singapore the upper equatorial easterlies will blow until 10°S after which the winds will 
increase from the west. In the southern winter, tropical North Australia remains hot whereas 
the south is comparatively cool. The temperature difference over the intervening subtropical 
and continental high will produce the westerly subtropical jet stream at the 200 mb level 
across the centre of the continent around 25°S. Speeds may reach 100 knots. From Sydney to 
Auckland, the westerly wind will moderate to 60-70 knots.
Icing 
Icing is not a special problem on this route.

Pressure Systems
ITCZ
Over Singapore the ITCZ is southbound in November/December and northbound in March. Its 
southerly extreme is just south of Darwin at the end of January. Thus it affects the Singapore 
- Darwin section of the route from November to March.
Continental Low
The Australian subtropical high belt of winter has moved south with the sun. Over Australia 
itself intense insolation brings low pressure to the interior.
Cyclones
Tropical cyclones and associated weather form adjacent to the ITCZ over the Coral and Timor 
Seas. They move at 10-15 knots in one of two general directions:
•	 Westwards, close to the North Australian coast, or
•	 Curve to the left from the Coral Sea around the South Pacific High to affect the Australian 
east coast at Brisbane.
Occasionally they travel further southeastwards degrading to a deep depression as they cross 
the Tasman Sea to New Zealand’s North Island.

Surface Winds
The northeast monsoon wind blowing from the South China Sea to Singapore will continue 
across the Equator to become now the northwest monsoon (Coriolis change) as far as the 
ITCZ; which in late January is just south of Darwin. Beyond the ITCZ there will be southeast 
trade winds although overland they will be modified around thermal low pressure centres.
At Sydney the SE trades can give way to a strong E/NE sea breeze, or southerly winds after 
the passage of a polar front cold front. The latter are known locally as Southerly Busters (see 
‘cloud and precipitation’ below).
Cyclones from the Coral Sea via Brisbane occasionally continue southeastwards over the 
Tasman Sea to produce very deep lows with strong variable winds but otherwise winds 
between Sydney and Auckland are generally westerly.
Visibility
Visibility over Darwin and to the north is good except in precipitation from CB/TS. Between 
Darwin and Sydney, clockwise rotation around continental low pressure carries dust to the 
centre and south of the route and occasional dust storms will occur sometimes known in the 
NW as “Willy-Willies”. Industrial haze near cities may reduce visibility to 1 - 2 km. Visibility over 
the Tasman Sea is good except in precipitation.
Cloud and Precipitation
The Singapore and Indonesia region is one of the most active daily thunderstorm areas 
in the world. This is due to high ambient temperature, strong overland insolation coupled 
possibly with orographic uplift, and high humidity from the abundant supply of sea water. At 
no time of the year is this region free from daily convective cloud, but the presence of the ITCZ 
enhances instability even further. Therefore in the southern summer, thunderstorms may be 
present all the way from Singapore to Darwin, and are reinforced by the ITCZ near Singapore 
in November/December and March, and near Darwin in January/February.
South of the ITCZ , the Australian interior is mainly arid. Towards Sydney, the weather is mainly 
subtropical excepting cyclones, but occasional cold troughs or fronts give squally wet weather.
The passage of these fronts causes a marked drop in temperature, CU CB, and squalls and a 
sharp back in the wind to south known in Sydney as “Southerly Busters”. Indeed the Sydney 
weather can be worst in summer.
From Sydney to Auckland, eastward travelling high cells, in the subtropical high belt, are 
interspersed with troughs and associated cold fronts.

Upper Winds
Light upper equatorial easterlies blow from Singapore to approximately 20°S after which winds 
will increase from the West. In summer the whole continent of Australia is hot with cooler sea 
to the south. Thus the 200 hPa subtropical westerly jet is now along the south coast at around 
70 knots reducing to 40 knots towards Auckland.

Icing can be severe above 16 000’ in CBs.

Geographical Considerations
The route over Egypt and Sudan is almost all over low lying Sahara desert. At the Kenya border 
latitude 06°N, the land rises, at the beginning of the equatorial vegetation belt, to over 5000’ 
by 02°S at Nairobi. The route then traverses the eastern edge of the Kalahari plateau to the 
high veld of Johannesburg.

Pressure Systems
In the northern winter, pressure will be high over the comparatively cool Sahara desert.
The ITCZ will be at its southern extreme over Zimbabwe. This will lead to overland low pressure 
extending south from Nairobi to Johannesburg.
Weather
The northern section from Cairo to 06°N will be dry and dusty.
Convective CU/CB and some NS will form near Nairobi, and further south instability will be 
further enhanced by the ITCZ.
At Johannesburg, orographic low cloud and fog can occur early morning, but this clears quickly 
to give way to convective CU and showers in the afternoon. It is the wet season.
Cyclones originating in the Mozambique Channel can sometimes move west to affect Zimbabwe 
and northern South Africa.
Surface Winds
The southerly Khamsin wind to the Mediterranean blows from Egypt between December and 
April.
Further south over Sudan and Kenya, clockwise outflow from the Sahara High will become first 
northerly then northeasterly to become the trade winds blowing from dry Saudi Arabia.
South of the Equator they will back again northerly (Coriolis change) to blow clockwise around 
southern Africa’s summer low pressure of some 1005 hPa; and for this reason, become easterly 
again near Johannesburg.
Visibility
Visibility is poor over the dusty Sahara but good towards Nairobi except in showery precipitation. 
At Johannesburg early morning fog can be caused by the easterly surface winds from the 
Indian Ocean orographically rising to the Kalahari plateau.
Icing
Icing can be severe above 16 000’ in CB near the ITCZ.

Weather
The ITCZ northern extreme is just north of Khartoum in July. This is therefore normally that 
city’s only wet month of the year. The ITCZ brings a tropical rain belt, line squalls and dust 
storms known as Haboobs which often appear as walls of dust lifted to 10 000’. Haboobs can 
appear in Northern Sudan from May to September as the ITCZ sweeps north then south. They 
form during the day when convection is strong.
It is winter in Johannesburg. Continental high pressure prevails and it is the dry season although 
ST and SC turbulence cloud may form in air rising orographically from the Indian Ocean to the 
Johannesburg high veld.
Surface Winds
High pressure over the Mediterranean, and low pressure over Arabia will give northerly surface 
winds (an extension of the Mediterranean Etesian) over the route from Cairo to the ITCZ which 
in July is near 18°N.
South of the ITCZ and north of the Equator, winds will be from the SW (Coriolis effect), 
reverting to the SE trade winds south of the Equator. Over southeastern Africa these SE trades 
are known as the Guti. The southeasterly Guti blows anticlockwise around the overland winter 
high, often being in place for five days or so at a time. It can bring the orographically formed 
ST & SC to Johannesburg.
Visibility
Visibility over the Sahara will be appalling in Haboobs, and poor elsewhere in Sahara dust. Near 
Nairobi it will be good except in showers. At Johannesburg visibility may be reduced below low 
ST/SC formed by the Guti SE wind.
Icing. 
As in winter, icing can be severe above 16 000’ in CB.

Orographic Uplift
At each ITCZ passage the surface W/V will be alternating between NE and SE. Nairobi has an 
elevation of over 5000’ and is only 200 NM from the east coast. Especially during the long and 
short rains at ITCZ passage, and between 0200 and 0800 local time, orographic uplift in the 
generally easterly winds can frequently produce low stratus, often lowering to the undulating 
surface as fog.
Thunderstorms
Convective thunderstorms can occur at any time but are very infrequent from June to September 
when the ITCZ is well north.
Tropopause and Freezing Levels
Tropopause heights average 56 000’ all year.
Freezing level heights are 16 000’ in equatorial regions and average 14 000’ in the higher 
latitudes in winter.

Satellite Observations
Introduction
Meteorology has benefited considerably by the use of satellites in recent years. Apart from the 
obvious advantages of satellite communications over the old land-based systems, providing 
prompt and trouble free communication of meteorological data, satellite photography has 
provided weather images that were impossible to produce in the past and were often merely 
‘artist’s impressions’ of the weather.
There are two types of satellite; the polar orbiting and the geostationary and two methods of 
producing the weather picture; visual photography and infrared.
Polar Orbiting Satellites
The so-called polar orbiting satellites have been put up principally by Russia (Meteor) and USA 
(NOAA). The NOAA orbit is inclined at an angle of 99° to the Equator, takes 1 h 42 min to orbit 
the earth, is between 820 and 870 km above the surface and covers a band 1500 NM wide. 
Each successive orbit is a little further west and there will be an overlap, greatest at the poles 
and small near the Equator. Any spot on the globe will experience a southbound pass of the 
satellite in the morning and a northbound pass in the afternoon or evening. Although picture 
definition is good, polar orbiting satellites do not give a continuous view of the weather.
Figure 24.1 Successive tracks of a polar orbiting satellite
Geostationary Satellites
Geostationary satellites are put into orbit over the Equator and since they take 24 hours to 
complete the orbit, they will appear to be stationary over a selected longitude. In 1987 there 
were 5 geostationary satellites in orbit; meteosat 2 over the Greenwich meridian, GOES E over 
longitude 75W, GOES W over longitude 135W, GMS 2 over longitude 140E and INSAT over 
longitude 70E.
These satellites are considerably higher than the polar orbiting satellites (36 000 km) and 
picture definition may not be as good, but the advantage of a continuous picture outweighs 
this disadvantage. Because of the Equatorial orbit the picture becomes somewhat distorted 
towards the poles, but this may be corrected by computer processing. Meteosat covers about
--- Page 472 ---

24
1/3 of the earth’s surface from 70° West to 70° East. The satellite transmits a picture every 4 
minutes and a useful feature is the time lapse sequence showing movement of weather over 
a period of time.
Visual Images
Although visual photography may be easy to interpret, it suffers the disadvantage of not being 
available continuously, due to lack of sunlight at night. Clouds will appear white, the land grey 
and the sea black.
Infrared (IR)
Infrared images have the advantage of being available for 24 hours a day and the shading of 
the picture will be more or less the same by day and by night. Cold (high) cloud will give a white 
image, lower cloud a somewhat darker one, whilst warm land will give a dark image. There 
are 9 IR temperature bands, black normally denoting cloud free areas. IR may not be able to 
distinguish between a sea surface and fog, which may have a similar temperature. In this case, 
a visual picture would be able to show the position of fog more precisely. (See Figure 24.2 & 
Figure 24.3).

False Colour Pictures
To help differentiate between the various shades of grey produced by both visual and IR 
photography, the shades may be converted by computer into various colours. This is used 
particularly with IR systems.
Location of the Image
It is often difficult to pick out geographical features, especially when there is thick cloud and 
of course, areas of oceans are completely featureless. Satellite images are therefore presented 
with a computer produced graticule of numbered parallels and meridians superimposed. 
Coastlines may be enhanced as well.

Interpretation of Satellite Photography
Whilst violent weather such as tropical revolving storms may produce an easily identifiable 
picture, normal weather pictures are best used in conjunction with synoptic charts. The time- 
lapse sequences can be used to confirm existing and forecast weather before setting off on 
a flight. Figure 24.4 & Figure 24.5 show a surface analysis and a satellite picture for the same 
time.

Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs)
Introduction
The letters METAR stand for METeorological Aerodrome Report.  METARs contain coded 
messages pertaining to the actual weather conditions at a given aerodrome, at a stated 
time.  Typical METARs for United Kingdom aerodromes, extracted from the United Kingdom 
Met Office website, are shown below.

METARs are usually issued every half hour during aerodrome operating hours.  The aim of this 
chapter is to explain the METAR coding, group by group.
Decoding the METAR
This example reproduces the first eight code-groups normally found in a METAR.

Report Type
The first code, (a), is the identification of the type of report; in this case a METAR. 
Aerodrome
The four-letter ICAO designator of the issuing aerodrome is shown next, (b); this example is 
for Oxford/Kidlington, EGTK.

Date-Time Group
The third group, (c), is the date/time group, which simply gives the date of the actual weather 
observation.  The first two digits represent the day of the month, followed by the time in 
hours and minutes.  Time is always given as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is, for 
all practical purposes, the same as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT): the local time at Greenwich, 
London.  In the METAR, itself, UTC is indicated by the code Z, pronounced “Zulu”.
Wind Information
The next items in the METAR (d, e, f and g) are the observed wind information.  Firstly, the 
direction of the wind given in degrees true, rounded up or down to the nearest 10 degrees, 
(d), and then the wind speed in knots, (e), which is a mean speed taken over a 10 minute 
period.  However, if a gust is observed which is at least 10 knots more than the mean wind 
speed, then a gust figure, (g), comes after the mean wind; this gust figure is preceded by the 
letter G, (f).  
The next code-group, (h), may or may not appear depending on the directional variability of 
the wind.  Variability of direction is included when the wind direction, over the preceding 10 
minutes, has changed by 60° or more.  The letter V will appear between these two extremes. 
If there is no wind, the coding, 00000KT, will be used. If the wind direction cannot be defined 
then VRB (for variable) replaces the direction.
Visibility
Visibility in the METAR is represented by the next group, depicted in red in the example.  In 
the METAR, the reported visibility is the prevailing visibility and, may, under certain conditions, 
include the minimum visibility.  Here, the prevailing visibility is reported as 0800 metres.  
Prevailing visibility is the visibility value which is either reached, or exceeded, around at least 
half the horizon circle, or within at least half of the surface of the aerodrome.  If the visibility 
in one direction, which is not the prevailing visibility, is less than 1500 m, or less than 50% of 
the prevailing visibility, the lowest visibility observed, and its general direction, should also be 
reported.  
Up to 10 km, the visibility is measured in metres.  For example, 6000 means that the prevailing 
visibility is 6000 metres.  Once the visibility reaches 10 km or more, the code figure used is 9999. 
Visibility of less than 50 metres is indicated by the code 0000.  In this example the prevailing 
visibility is 800 metres.
METAR   EGTK   231020Z    26012G25KT   220V300   0800
In some instances, runway visibility information is given in a METAR; this is known as Runway 
Visual Range (RVR.)  RVR is given only when either the horizontal visibility or the RVR, itself, 
is less than 1500 metres.  The RVR group starts with the letter R, and then goes on to give the 
runway in use, followed by the threshold visibility in metres. 
In the following example, for Oxford Kidlington, we have a prevailing visibility of 800 metres, 
with an RVR, at the threshold of Runway 30, of 1100 metres.

Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs)
If the RVR is more than the maximum reportable value of 1500 metres, the code P is used in 
front of the visibility value, R30/P1500. If the visibility is less than 50 m then the prefix M will 
be used e.g. R30/M0050
A letter can sometimes come after the RVR to indicate any trends that the RVR has shown.  A U 
means that the visibility has increased by 100 m or more in the last 10 minutes, e.g. R30/1100U. 
A D shows that visibility has decreased by 100 m or more in that same time period, R30/1100D. 
An N added to the visibility group shows that there is no distinct trend observed, R30/1100N.
The Weather Group 
The next section of the METAR is the weather group.  The weather group gives information on 
the present weather at, or near, the aerodrome at the time of the observation.  The weather 
group +SHRA added to our example METAR  means “heavy showers of rain”.  
METAR   EGTK   211020Z   26012G25KT   0800   R30/1100  +SHRA

The first column represents the intensity or proximity of a weather phenomenon.  These have 
the following meaning:
•	 - meaning light
•	 + meaning heavy
•	 VC meaning in the vicinity of, but not at, the observation point
•	 If there is no qualifier (+ or -) in front of precipitation then the precipitation is moderate
The second column in the table, bearing the title Descriptor, contains letters which add detail 
to each weather phenomenon; for example, BC means patches, and is frequently used to 
describe fog, SH means showers, and TS means  thunderstorm.
The last three columns in the table contain codes which describe the weather phenomena 
themselves.  
The column headed Precipitation contains codes for drizzle, rain, snow, hail etc.  The next 
column covers those weather phenomena which are classified as Obscurations; these include 
mist, fog, smoke, and ash.  
The last column in the table contains those weather phenomena which have not already been 
mentioned in the table.  This group mainly consists of the more unusual weather events that 
are rarely reported in the United Kingdom.  
Referring to the weather group of the partially complete METAR which indicated heavy showers 
of rain, +SHRA, we see that + means heavy, SH indicates showers and RA stands for rain.
Thunderstorms
A Thunderstorm report will appear in a METAR if thunder has been heard within the last 10 
minutes.
A thunderstorm is represented by the letters TS.  If there is no precipitation, the letters TS will 
appear on their own.  However, if there is precipitation, a further two letters, which signify the 
type of precipitation, are inserted after the TS.  For example, if there is rain observed from the 
thunderstorm, TSRA will appear in the METAR.  If hail were to be observed, the code would 
read TSGR, or TSGS, with GS meaning small hail.
Cloud Coverage
The next code-group to appear in the METAR gives detail of cloud coverage, as highlighted in red 
below. In this case the highlighted code means: overcast sky, base 2000 ft, with cumulonimbus. 
METAR  EGTK  211020Z  26012G25KT 0800  R30/1100  +SHRA OVC020CB
There are several prefixes which are used to describe cloud amount, at any given level.  Cloud 
coverage is reported in the METAR using the following three-letter codes:
•	 FEW (FEW) meaning one to two eighths of cloud coverage.
•	 SCATTERED (SCT) meaning three to four eighths of cloud coverage.
•	 BROKEN (BKN) meaning five to seven eighths of cloud coverage.
•	 OVERCAST (OVC) meaning complete cloud coverage, or eight eighths.

Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs)
             
               
             
Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs)
Figure 25.1 
Cloud base is given as a three-digit figure showing hundreds of feet.  Cloud base in a METAR 
is always measured as height above aerodrome level, using the current aerodrome QFE.
For example, 6 eighths of cloud (6 oktas) at 1900 ft above aerodrome level would appear in the 
METAR as BKN019.  8 oktas at five hundred feet would be abbreviated to OVC005. 
The only cloud types that are specified in the METAR are the significant convective clouds. 
These are cumulonimbus (CB) and towering cumulus (TCU). 
Looking back to the cloud group we see the code OVC020CB.  This refers to an overcast sky 
covered by convective cumulonimbus cloud whose base is 2000 ft above aerodrome level. 
The previous weather group, +SHRA, indicates that the cloud detailed in the cloud group is 
producing a heavy shower of rain.  If there is no cloud of operational significance (CB or TCU) 
or no cloud at or below the greater of 5000 ft or the highest minimum sector altitude then the 
term NSC (no significant cloud) will be used unless CAVOK (see below) is appropriate.
Obscuration
If the sky at an aerodrome is obscured for reasons other than cloud cover, and cloud coverage 
cannot easily be determined, the code VV is used in place of the cloud information.  VV is 
followed by the vertical visibility in hundreds of feet. 
METAR   EGTK  231020Z   26005KT   0300 FG  VV002
	
	
	
	
	
 (a)            (b)
The highlighted codes in this METAR indicate that:
Visibility is 300 m in fog (a), the sky is obscured and the vertical visibility is 200 ft.
This METAR decodes as follows: 
METAR for Oxford/Kidlington, observed at 1020 UTC on 23rd of the month; the surface wind 
is 260° True, at 5 kt; the visibility is 300 m in fog (a); the sky is obscured with a vertical visibility 
of 200 ft (b).

If the vertical visibility cannot be assessed, three forward slashes will replace the cloud height 
figures, e.g. VV///. 
The code CAVOK is frequently used in the METAR code, being the abbreviation for “cloud, 
ceiling and visibility are OK.”  If CAVOK is used, it will replace the visibility, RVR, weather and 
cloud groups.  There are four criteria which must be met in order for CAVOK to appear in the 
METAR.   These are:
•	 the visibility must be 10 kilometres or more.
•	 the height of the lowest cloud must be no less than 5000 ft, or the level of highest minimum 
sector altitude, whichever is the greater.
•	 there must be no cumulonimbus or ‘towering cumulus’ (TCU) present.
•	 there must be no significant weather at or in the vicinity of the aerodrome.
METAR   EGTK    231020Z   26012G25KT    220V300   CAVOK
Temperature and Dew Point
The temperature and dew point constitute the next group in the METAR code.  The 
temperature and dew point code is simply a two-digit number giving the air temperature, 
with a forward slash, followed by another two-digit number which indicates the dew point. 
Both temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius.  For example, the code 10/02 indicates 
that the air temperature is plus 10°C, and the dew point is plus 2°C.  If either figure is negative, 
the prefix M will be used, as in 10/M02.  The dew point in the example just given is minus 2°C.
Note: the normal mathematical convention of rounding 0.5 to the next highest digit is used.  So 
+1.5 would be reported as ‘02’, and -1.5 would be reported as ‘M01’.  -0.5 would be reported 
as M00.
METAR EGTK  231020Z 26012G25KT 220V300 CAVOK 10/M02
This METAR decodes as follows: 
METAR for Oxford/Kidlington, observed at 1020 UTC on 23rd of the month; the surface wind is 
260° (True) at 12 knots, gusting to 25 knots and varying in direction from 220° (T) to 300° (T); 
the visibility is 10 km or more, with no cloud below 5000 ft; there are no CB or TCU and there 
is no significant weather at, or in the vicinity of, the aerodrome; the air temperature is +10°C 
and the dew point is -2°C.
QNH
The next METAR code is the QNH.  The QNH will be represented by the letter Q, followed 
by a four digit number representing the actual pressure value. If the QNH is less than 1000 
hectopascals, the value will be preceded by a zero. For example, a QNH of 991 hectopascals 
would appear as Q0991.
METAR  EGTK  231020Z 26012G25KT 220V300 9999 -RA FEW060 SCT120 10/M02  Q0991
It is important to note that the only pressure value given in a METAR is the QNH.  The QNH 
is always rounded down for safety reasons, if there are digits after the decimal point; for 
instance, if the QNH were 991.7 hectopascals, the QNH would be reported as Q0991.

Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs)
In N. America QNH is reported in inches of mercury.  The letter ‘A’ is used to indicate this, e.g. 
A2989 means a QNH of 29.89 inches of mercury.
The above METAR decodes as follows: 
METAR for Oxford/Kidlington observed at 1020 UTC on 23rd of the month; the surface wind 
is 260° (T) at 12 kt, gusting to 25 kt, and variable in direction from 220° (T) to 300° (T); 
the prevailing visibility is 10 km or more with light rain; there are 1 to 2 oktas of cloud at 
6000 ft and 3 to 4 oktas at 12 000 ft; the air temperature is +10° C and the dew point is -2° C; 
the QNH is 991 hectopascals.
Recent Weather
If there has been recent significant weather, either in the past hour, or since the last METAR 
was issued, and if the significant weather has ceased, or reduced in intensity, a METAR code 
group beginning with RE will appear.  RE stands for recent.  If there has been a thunderstorm 
during the hour, but which has now abated, giving only light rain, the present weather is 
reported as light rain, –RA; the fact that there have been thunderstorms in the past hour is 
reported by the code RETS:

be reported in the METAR.  This will simply be denoted by the letters WS, followed by the 
necessary details, such as WS ALL RWY, meaning windshear on all runways, or WS 30, 
meaning windshear present on Runway 30.
METAR EGTK 231020Z 26012G25KT 220V300 9999 –RA FEW060 SCT120 10/M02 Q0991 RETS 
WS ALL RWY
TREND, BECMG, TEMPO
A TREND forecast is valid for 2 hours after the time of the observation of the METAR, and 
constitutes the final section of the METAR.  The change in weather conditions indicated by the 
code, TREND, can be further qualified by the codes, BECMG, meaning becoming, or TEMPO 
meaning temporarily.
BECMG indicates that the change in the present weather will be long-lasting.  TEMPO, on the 
other hand, means that the change is temporary, and that the different conditions will prevail 
for periods of less than one hour, only, and no more than half the time period, in aggregate. 
The codes may be followed by a time period in hours and minutes.  The time periods given may 
be preceded by FM meaning from, TL meaning until, or AT meaning at.
For example, TEMPO FM1020 TL1220 1000 +SHRA  translates as: temporarily, from 1020Z to 
1220Z, the visibility will reduce to 1000 metres, in heavy showers of rain.
If there is no expected change in the meteorological conditions being forecast by the METAR, 
the code NOSIG is used to indicate that no significant change is expected in the next two 
hours.

Runway State Group
A runway state group will be added to a METAR or SPECI (see below) when there is significant 
contamination on the runway.  The format is RXX/XXXXXX the runway designator followed by 
an oblique then 6 digits describing the contamination state.
Runway Designator 
R27 = Runway 27 or R27L = runway 27 left
R88 = All runways
R99 = A repetition of the last message received because no new information received
Runway Deposits  - 1st digit
0 = Clear and dry
1 = Damp
2 = Wet or water patches 
3 = Rime or frost covered (depth normally less than 1 mm)
4 = Dry snow
5 = Wet snow
6 = Slush
7 = Ice
8 = Compacted or rolled snow
9 = Frozen ruts or ridges
/ = Type of deposit not reported (e.g. due to runway clearance in progress)
Extent of Runway Contamination - 2nd digit
1 = 10% or less 
2 = 11% to 25% 
5 = 26% to 50% 
9 = 51% to 100%
/ = Not reported (e.g. due to runway clearance in progress)
Depth of Deposit - 3rd & 4th digits 
The quoted depth is the mean number of readings or, if operationally significant, the greatest 
depth measured.
00 = less than 1 mm
01 = 1 mm etc. through to ...
90 = 90 mm 
91 = not used 
92 = 10 cm 
93 = 15 cm 
94 = 20 cm 
95 = 25 cm
96 = 30 cm
97 = 35 cm
98 = 40 cm or more
99 = Runway(s) non-operational due to snow, slush, ice, large drifts or runway clearance, but 
depth not reported
// = Depth of deposit operationally not significant or not measurable

Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs)
Friction Coefficient or Braking Action - 5th & 6th digits 
The mean value is transmitted or, if operationally significant, the lowest value. 
For example:
28 = Friction coefficient 0.28 
35 = Friction coefficient 0.35 
or
91 = Braking action: Poor 
92 = Braking action: Medium/Poor
93 = Braking action: Medium
94 = Braking action: Medium/Good
95 = Braking action: Good
99 = Figures unreliable (e.g. if equipment has been used which does not measure satisfactorily 
in slush or loose snow)
// = Braking action not reported
Note 1: 
CLRD. If contamination conditions on all runways cease to exist, a group consisting of the code 
R88/, the abbreviation CLRD, and the Braking Action, is sent.
Note 2: 
Within the UK friction coefficient measurements are only made on runways contaminated 
by ice (gritted or ungritted) and dry or compacted snow. Where contamination is caused by 
water, slush or wet snow then the friction coefficient or braking action should be reported as 
//.
Note 3: 
It should be noted that runways can only be inspected as frequently as conditions permit, 
so that a re-issue of a previous half hourly report does not necessarily mean that the runway 
has been inspected again during this period, but might mean that no significant change is 
apparent.
Note 4: 
It is emphasized that this reporting system is completely independent of the normal NOTAM 
system and these reports are not used by AIS for amending SNOWTAM received from 
originators.
If the aerodrome is closed due to contamination of runways, the abbreviation SNOCLO is used 
in place of a runway state group.
Special Reports
A variation on the METAR is the Special Report.  A Special Report, which is denoted by the 
abbreviation, SPECI, has the same format as a METAR except that the code SPECI will replace 
METAR at the beginning of the report.  A SPECI will be issued when the weather conditions 
significantly change in the period between routine observations.  A SPECI can be issued to 
indicate either an improvement or a deterioration in the weather.

Auto
Many aerodromes which are not used on a regular basis, or have limited staff available, have 
automatic meteorological stations which generate the METARs. This is an example of such a 
METAR:
EGDL 070650Z AUTO 03013KT //// // FEW110/// 09/06 Q1023 =
Note that where a field cannot be determined it is not omitted but replaced by ‘/’.  So at 
Lyneham the visibility, weather and type of cloud cannot be determined and these groups 
have been replaced by a ‘/’ for each element of the group.
End of Message
An equals sign (=) appears at the end of the METAR to denote that the message is complete.

Summary
Although METARs may appear confusing to the uninitiated, with practice, it is quite a simple 
task to decode a METAR accurately and speedily.  Pilots should consult METARs for departure 
and destination aerodromes and also for other aerodromes along the planned route, and, in 
particular, for aerodromes upwind of a destination aerodrome, in order to get a picture of the 
weather which is approaching the destination.  
If the aerodrome of destination does not issue a METAR, consult a METAR from an aerodrome 
in the vicinity of your destination.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFS)
Introduction
Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs) are forecasts of meteorological conditions at an 
aerodrome, as opposed to the report of actual, present conditions as given in a METAR.  The 
format of the TAF is similar, however, to that of a METAR, with many of the coding groups 
identical in both the METAR and TAF.  TAFs usually cover a period of between 9 and 30 hours. 
9-hour TAFs are issued every 3 hours, and 12 to 24-hour TAFs every 6 hours.

Decoding TAFs
The first code which appears in the TAF is the identifier, TAF. The next code is the ICAO location 
indicator of the aerodrome for which the report is issued.  The example given below is for 
EGTK, Oxford, Kidlington, airport.
TAF  EGTK 130600Z 1307/1316 31015KT 8000 -SHRA SCT010 BKN018=
The Date-Time Information
As we have established, the TAF  gives a forecast for a period of time.  Consequently, the date-
time information in TAFs is slightly different from that given in a METAR.  In the TAF, there are 
two items of date-time information.  
The first date-time group, highlighted in red below, indicates the date and time at which the 
TAF was issued.
TAF EGTK 130600Z 1307/1316 31015KT 8000 -SHRA SCT010 BKN018=
The digits 13 identify the day of the month; this information is followed by the time in hours 
and minutes UTC.  The above TAF, then, was issued on 13th of the month, at 0600 hours, UTC. 
In the TAF, Coordinated Universal Time, UTC, is indicated by the letter, Z.
The next code-group identifies the period of validity of the TAF.  The information here uses an 
eight-digit format. The first four digits show the start date and time, so 1307 indicates that the 
TAF’s validity period starts on the 13th at 0700Z. The next four digits are the end date and time
--- Page 494 ---
Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFS)
26
488
               Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs)
26
of the validity period. So, in the example given below, the date and time of the origin of the 
report is 0600 UTC on 13th of the month, and the validity period, highlighted in red, is from 
the 13th at 0700 UTC to 1600 UTC on the same day.  This example, then, is a nine hour TAF.
TAF EGTK 130600Z 1307/1316 31015KT 8000 –SHRA SCT010 BKN018=
Wind
The wind codes in the TAF are the same as in the METAR.  Our example TAF shows a mean 
wind direction of 310° (True), at a wind speed of 15 knots.
TAF EGTK 130600Z 1307/1316 31015KT 8000 –SHRA SCT010 BKN018=
Weather
The weather coding in the TAF is also the same as in the METAR.  In our example, the visibility 
is 8000 m with light showers of rain.
TAF EGTK 130600Z 1307/1316 31015KT 8000 –SHRA SCT010 BKN018=
Cloud
Cloud coding in the TAF can be slightly different from the METAR.
If there is no cloud below the greater of 5000 ft or minimum sector altitude and if there is no 
CB or TCU and CAVOK is not appropriate, the code NSC is used, which stands for no significant 
cloud.
As with METARs, only CB or TCU clouds will be included in TAFs.
TAF EGTK 130600Z 1307/1316 31015KT 8000 –SHRA SCT010 BKN018=
Our example TAF, above, is forecasting 3-4 oktas of cloud at 1000 ft, with 5-7 oktas of cloud at 
1800 ft.
The main TAF information ends with the cloud group.  TAFs do not contain information  on 
temperature and dew point, QNH, recent weather, windshear or runway state information. 
However, some countries do forecast maximum and minimum temperatures for the forecast 
period (see below). 
Only significant changes of weather follow the cloud group.  These significant changes are 
introduced by codes classified as forecast change indicators.
Forecast Change Indicators
There are distinctive TAF codes which indicate that a change is expected in some or all of the 
forecast meteorological conditions.  The nature of the change can vary: it may, for instance, be 
a rapid, gradual or temporary change.  These codes are FM (meaning FROM), BECMG (meaning 
BECOMING), TEMPO (meaning TEMPORARILY), and PROB (meaning PROBABILITY).

The From (FM) Group
The FROM group in a TAF is introduced by the code FM and marks the fact that a rapid change 
in the forecast conditions is expected, which will lead to the appearance of a new set of 
prevailing conditions becoming established at the aerodrome.

The change indicator FM is followed by a six-digit date and time group. The first two digits 
are the day of the month followed by the hours and minutes to indicate the time at which the 
change is expected to begin. In our example FM 131220 means that certain weather changes 
will occur from the 13th at 1220 UTC.  This weather forecast following the code FM supersedes 
the TAF forecast, prior to 1220 UTC.
The FM indicator, therefore, introduces what is effectively a new forecast, associated with a 
new weather situation, and which supersedes the previous forecast.  The FM group contains all 
the elements of a complete TAF forecast: wind, visibility, weather and cloud.
In the example below, highlighted in red, we read that from the 13th at 1220Z until the end of 
the TAF period, the wind will change to be 270° (T) at 17 kt, with a prevailing visibility of 4000 
metres, and broken cloud at 1000 ft.

4000 BKN010=
The forecast following the FM indicator continues either to the end of the current TAF, or until 
another change indicator occurs in the TAF.
The Becoming (BECMG) Group
The change group BECMG, meaning becoming, is followed by an eight-figure date and time 
group which indicates the period during which there will be a permanent change in the 
forecast conditions.
The forecast change, introduced by BECMG, will occur at an unspecified time within the time 
period stated.
The following example TAF indicates that, at some time on the 13th between 0900 UTC and 
1100 UTC, but definitely by 1100 UTC, the prevailing conditions will give 5000 metres visibility, 
in light rain.  There is no new wind information after BECMG, so the inference is that the wind 
will be as previously forecast: 310° (T) at 15 kt.

–RA=
The Temporary (TEMPO) Group
TEMPO, meaning temporarily, indicates that a change in meteorological conditions will occur 
at any time within the specified time period, but is expected to last less than one hour each 
time, and, in aggregate, will last no longer than half the time period of the complete forecast. 
The TEMPO indicator is followed by an 8-digit date and time group indicating the hours 
between which the temporary conditions are expected to begin and end.

The example TAF, which follows, tells us that sometime on the 13th between 1200 UTC and 
1400 UTC, the visibility will fall to 4000 metres, with the weather being thunderstorms and 
moderate rain.   There will be 5 - 7 oktas of cumulonimbus cloud at 1000 ft.  However, after 
1400 UTC, the weather will return to the conditions specified in the first part of the message.

TSRA BKN010CB=
The Probability (PROB) Indicator
The code PROB (meaning probability) in a TAF indicates the probability of the occurrence of 
specified weather phenomena.
The probability indication is a percentage probability of the occurrence of significant weather 
events such as thunderstorms and associated precipitation.  A 30% probability is considered 
low, while a 40% probability indicates that it is highly likely that the weather being forecast 
will actually occur.  The code PROB can be followed by a time group of its own, and/or by an 
indicator, such as BECMG or TEMPO.
The example TAF below tells us that there is a high probability that, between 1000 UTC and 
1400 UTC, there will be thunderstorms with heavy rain and hail, and from 3 to 4 oktas of 
cumulonimbus clouds at 500 ft.  
The storms will not last longer than one hour at a time and less than two hours in total, which 
is one half of the period to which the TEMPO applies.

1310/1314 +TSRAGR SCT005CB=
Temperature
Some meteorological authorities include forecast maximum and minimum temperatures 
likely to be experienced in the forecast period of the TAF.  The format is:
TX15/2016Z, meaning maximum temperature is expected to be 15°C at 201600Z.
TN09/2105Z, meaning minimum temperature is expected to be 9°C at 210500Z.
Amendment
When a TAF requires an amendment, the amended forecast may be indicated by the code 
AMD, highlighted in red, after the TAF identifier, as shown below:
TAF AMD EGTK 130600Z 1307/1316 31015KT 8000 –SHRA SCT010 BKN018 PROB40 TEMPO 
1310/1314 +TSRAGR SCT005CB=
Used correctly, TAFs will enable a pilot to make accurate and informed decisions about a 
planned flight, including the expected conditions en-route, and at destination and alternate 
aerodromes.
End of Message
An equals sign (=) appears at the end of the TAF to denote that the message is complete.

Significant Weather and Wind Charts
Introduction
The World Area Forecast System (WAFS) was established by ICAO in conjunction with the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO).  The system has 2 world area forecast centres 
(WAFC):
•	 London (actually the UK Meteorological Office at Exeter)
•	 Washington (actually the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - NOAA at 
Kansas City).
The centres are required to provide essential real time meteorological broadcasts for aviation 
to meet the requirements of ICAO Annex 3.  These are medium level (FL100 to FL250) and high 
level (FL250 to FL630) significant weather (SIGWX) charts and spot wind and temperature 
charts for FL100, FL180, FL240, FL300, FL340, FL390, FL450, FL530 and FL610.
This data is broadcast by the UK Met Office on the Satellite Distribution System (SADIS) and 
by NOAA on the International Satellite Communication System (ISCS).  The information is also 
available on line.  The UK Met Office’s area of responsibility extends from the West Atlantic 
Ocean through Europe and Africa to the west coast of the Pacific Ocean.   NOAA covers the 
Pacific Ocean and the Americas.  The two centres work in duplicate so each is capable of 
meeting the global requirement in the event of failure at one of the centres.
All the charts are fixed time charts valid  only at the time stated on the chart.  These charts are 
issued at 6 hour intervals usually 18 - 24 hours in advance.  Flight in between the validity times 
will require the pilot to interpolate between consecutive charts.
Figure 27.1 is an example of a SIGWX chart.  This chart is for Europe and surrounding areas. 
Top left on the chart are the details showing the WAFC reference (PGDE14) and date and time 
of issue - 280000 (Z).  Below is the originating agency and issuing agency (both WAFC London). 
Then a reminder that these are fixed time charts valid only for the time stated (0000 UTC 29 
APR 2013).  Note that this chart, unlike other SIGWX charts, covers levels FL100 to FL450.
The thick black lines on the chart are jet streams.  The jet stream to the west of the UK has a 
speed of 100 kt SW of Iceland rising to 120 kt to the NW of Ireland then dropping to 100 kt.  The 
core of the jet stream is at FL310 with speeds exceeding 80 kt (40 mps) extending from FL250 
to FL370. The start and end of the jet stream lines occur where the wind speed exceeds 80 kt. 
By convention the wind speed triangles and feathers point towards the low temperature.
The jet streams to the south and southwest of the UK have an enclosed area surrounded by a 
dashed line with the number 3 in a square box.  This is an area of clear air turbulence (CAT) and 
is amplified in the legend on the left which advised of moderate CAT extending from FL240 to 
FL360.
Extending from SE England to the Northern Baltic is an area designated by a wavy line.  This is 
an area of significant weather.  Over the Southern Baltic is a box with an arrow attaching it to 
this area.  The box shows:
moderate turbulence extending from below FL100 (the lowest level of the 
chart) to FL140 and moderate icing extending over the same altitude band.

Figure 27.1 Europe significant weather chart
Between Sardinia, Spain and France is another area of significant weather attached to the 
following box:
Within the area we have individual cumulonimbus embedded in other cloud 
with base below FL100 and tops up to FL320.  No further information is given 
here but the middle box of the legend advises what you should expect from CB. 
I hope no further amplification is necessary!
Here are some of the abbreviations associated with CB (and TS) with their meaning:
ISOL, (Isolated): individual
OCNL, (Occasional): well separated
FRQ, (Frequent): little or no separation between CB
SQL, (Squall): a line of CB with little or no separation
Over the UK is a rectangular box with the number 350, this shows that the height of the 
tropopause is FL350 in that location. West of northern Spain is a similar box with an upward 
pointing arrow indicating a tropopause high.
Finally you will recognize the letters as being the location of major cities or aviation locations.
Full symbology for significant weather charts is in Figure 27.2 and Figure 27.3.

showing wind and temperature for a particular flight level. The flight levels are listed in 
column 3 of page 3-5-10 of the GEN section of the Air Pilot (Appendix A to Chapter 18). On 
these charts winds are given every 5° of latitude and longitude using the symbology shown

Significant Weather and Wind Charts
Figure 27.4 Wind temperature chart for FL340
To find the wind and temperature at a position other than that at a lat/long intersection, some 
careful interpolation is required. To find an average wind for a whole route you must split the 
route into a number of sections, say 10° of latitude or longitude (depending on the direction) 
find the wind & temperature for each section and find a mathematical average. If the winds 
found vary through 360°, you will have to take care e.g. the average of the two winds 310/20 
and 010/30 is 340/25 and not 160/25! 
NOTE: this chart is a portion of a polar stereographic projection which has the pole at the 
centre and the meridians radiate as the spokes of a bicycle wheel.  Take care to check the local 
direction of north when estimating wind direction.
To find the wind component, the average W/V will have to be applied to the mean track 
for the route using a representative TAS and the navigation computer. (For normal subsonic 
jet transport aircraft flying between 30 000 and 40 000 ft, 480 kt is a reasonable figure). For 
example; determine the average wind and temperature for the route from Madrid to Athens:
--- Page 508 ---
Significant Weather and Wind Charts
27
502
Significant Weather and Wind Charts
27
As noted above, we must take wind/temperature along the route at suitable intervals, 
interpolating where necessary:
(We do not need to be precise in wind direction because the averaging will cancel minor error 
in measurement).
At 000°E by interpolation we get:	
	
	
220°/25 kt	
-40°C
At 005°E by interpolation we get:	
	
	
250°/25 kt	
-39°C
At 010°E by interpolation we get:	
	
	
270°/25 kt	
-39°C
At 015°E we have:	
	
	
	
	
290°/30 kt	
-39°C
At 020°E by interpolation we get:	
	
	
310°/50 kt	
-41°C
To determine the average add up the wind directions and divide by the total number of items 
collected: 1340/5=268°, repeating for wind speeds gives 31 kt and temperature gives -40°C.  So 
the answer to nearest 5° for wind direction, 5 kt for speed and 1° for temperature is:
270°/30 kt, -40°C
The questions at the end of this chapter cover the use of both the significant weather and 
temperature charts.

Low Level Forecast Information
To meet the low level requirement, the UKMO produces forecast weather charts giving 
conditions at 6 hourly intervals, 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z.  The charts are valid for a 9

hour period of validity.  These charts are produced for the UK (form 215) and for NW Europe 
(form 415).  Spot wind and temperature charts are also produced valid for 6 hour periods 
centred on the above times.  Form 214 is produced for the UK and form 414 for NW Europe.
Forms 215/415
The presentation on these charts is somewhat different to the WAFS sig wx charts but the 
same symbology is used along with an extended set of abbreviations.
The chart is divided into lettered areas, delineated with wavy lines, with the surface visibility, 
weather, cloud and the altitude of the 0°C isotherm tabulated on the right for each of the 
areas.  Areas may be subdivided as area B is on this chart when there are minor changes which 
do not justify the provision of an extra area.
The conditions in area A:
Generally, visibility will be 15 km with nil weather or light rain.  In less than 50% of the area 
visibility will be 7 km in moderate rain or light rain and drizzle.  Less than 25% of the area will 
have visibility 3000 m in moderate rain and drizzle and mist.  Less than 25% of the area will 
have 800 m visibility in fog or drizzle and hill fog on some hills and less than 50% of the area 
will experience hill fog.   See below for the interpretation of ISOL et al.
Cloud: 5 - 8 oktas of AC and AS with moderate icing and turbulence extending from base 8000 
ft to tops which are above 10 000 ft (xxx).  3 - 7 oktas CU and SC (locally 8 oktas at the front) 
with moderate turbulence from base 1500 ft to 3000 ft and 4000 ft to 10 000 ft.  In less than 
50% of the area 3 to 7 oktas of ST base 400 ft, but on the surface in fog, tops 1000 to 1500 ft.
The freezing level varies from 8000 ft to above 10 000 ft.
Note: All vertical positions are above mean sea level.
The arrows indicate the direction and speed of movement of the fronts and weather areas. 
Slow means speed is less than 5 kt.  When planning a flight account must be made of the 
movement of the weather systems.

Significant Weather and Wind Charts
27
The definitions used in the F215/415 relating to the extent of weather are adopted in the UK 
by the Aviation Met. Authority in the CAA, and used by the Met Office. These are:
Widespread (WDSPR)
Implies conditions affecting many places, which will be difficult to avoid (greater than 50% of 
area affected) (used for non-convective and convective types).
Frequent (FRQ)
Used if within a particular area there is little separation between phenomena, and the spatial 
coverage is greater than 50% of the area forecast to be affected by that phenomenon (used 
for convective types only). These features will be difficult to avoid.
Occasional (OCNL)
Used if an area consists of well separated features which are forecast to affect an area with a 
maximum spatial coverage of between 25% and 50% of the area concerned. These features 
can be avoided by users.
Isolated (ISOL)
Used if an area consists of individual features which are forecast to affect an area with a 
maximum spatial coverage of between less than 25% of the area concerned. These features 
can be easily avoided.

Forms 214/414
These forms give spot wind and temperature information at selected locations.
As stated on the form the heights are in thousands of feet above mean sea level.  To extract 
winds and temperatures for a route will require interpolation between the heights and the 
appropriate data boxes.
For example flying a route at FL070 over Bristol (EGGD).
Unless there is exceptionally high or exceptionally low pressure the will be no need to 
adjust the height for the difference between QNH and SPS.
Now interpolating between the data from the boxes for 5230N 0230W and 5230N 0500W 
for FL140: gives temperature -7°C (to the nearest integer) and wind velocity – 260°T/35 kt 
(nearest 5° and 5 kt).  Another question that may arise is to determine the stability between 
2 levels.  E.g. At 50N 0230W, what is the stability state between FL020 and FL050?  Here 
the temperature reduction is 6° over 3000 ft giving a lapse rate of 2°C/1000 ft.  So at that 
location between those levels the atmosphere is conditionally unstable.
In a situation where pressure patterns are changing rapidly, for example when a fast moving 
polar front depression is crossing the region, it would be prudent to interpolate between 
consecutive forms 214/414 particularly towards the limits of the forecast periods.  As we have 
seen above the speed of movement of systems is found on the forms 215/415.

Warning Messages
Introduction
There are several different messages used to alert pilots to en route and terminal meteorological 
hazards to aviation.  These are:
•	 Aerodrome Warnings
•	 Windshear Warnings
•	 SIGMET
•	 Volcanic Ash Advisory Messages
•	 Tropical Cyclone Warning Messages
Aerodrome Warnings
Aerodrome warnings will be issued by the competent meteorological authority for the 
following hazards:
a) gales
b) strong wind warnings when mean speed exceeding 20 kt (gust 28 kt) or 25 kt (gust 37 kt) 
dependent on aerodrome requirements
c) thunderstorms, hail or squalls
d) snow
e) frost warnings including hoar frost and glaze or rime ice
f) fog (when the visibility is expected to fall below 600 m)
g) freezing precipitation
Additionally  a warning of a marked temperature inversion will be issued at selected aerodromes 
if a temperature increase of 10°C or more exists between the surface and 1000 ft above the 
surface.
Windshear Warnings
Windshear warnings for aerodromes may be appended to METARs (not UK) or passed by ATC. 
The format is variable and could be given as loss/gain in airspeed, crosswind variations or up/
downdraughts dependent on what has been experienced or is likely to occur.  They will be 
issued for conditions on approach or departure paths up to 1600 ft above aerodrome level 
unless a greater height is deemed prudent.  Windshear warnings will be issued by the Met 
Office when conditions indicate that windshear is probable and/or when reported by pilots.

SIGMET
SIGMETs are warnings of the occurrence of the significant weather hazards noted below to 
aircraft within a flight information region (FIR), they are not issued for hazards at aerodromes. 
The competent meteorological watch office will issue a SIGMET when hazardous conditions 
are forecast and/or reported by aircraft.
ICAO requires that they are valid for 4 hours, but SIGMET for tropical cyclones (WC) or volcanic 
ash (WV) are valid for 6 hours.  Practically they will be valid for the period stated in the message.
SIGMET will be issued for:
•	 thunderstorm;
•	 heavy hail;
•	 tropical cyclone;
•	 freezing rain;
•	 severe turbulence (not associated with convective cloud);
•	 severe icing (not associated with convective cloud);
•	 severe mountain waves;
•	 heavy sand/dust storm;
•	 volcanic ash cloud.
The SIGMET message uses abbreviated text format which is relatively easy to interpret.  In the 
following table are some of the common terms used (the list is not exhaustive):

Second SIGMET issued for the Scottish flight information region (EGPX) by the meteorological 
watch office at Exeter (EGRR), valid from 1115Z to 1715Z on the 9th of the month.  Severe 
turbulence forecast and observed below FL060 northwest of a line from 5425N 00810W to 
5900N 00200E moving southeast at 20 kt and southeast of a line from 5800N 01000W to 
6100N 00800W moving southeast at 25 kt.  No change in intensity expected.
Volcanic Ash
ICAO in conjunction with WMO has established 9 volcanic ash advisory centres (VAAC), see 
map.
Figure 28.1 Map of VAACs
These centres are operated by the national meteorological services of the countries and are 
responsible for detecting volcanic ash clouds and tracking and forecasting future movement of 
the clouds both horizontally and vertically.
The following is an example of a message issued by a VAAC (note: these messages may be 
reissued as SIGMET (WV) by the meteorological watch office):

The aviation colour coding is:
AVIATION COLOUR CODES RECOMMENDED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION 
ORGANIZATION.
GREEN
Volcano is in normal, non-eruptive state.
or, after a change from a higher level: 
Volcanic activity considered to have ceased, and volcano reverted to its 
normal, non-eruptive state. 
YELLOW
Volcano is experiencing signs of elevated unrest above known background 
levels. 
or, after a change from higher level: 
Volcanic activity has decreased significantly but continues to be closely 
monitored for possible renewed increase
ORANGE
Volcano is exhibiting heightened unrest with increased likelihood of 
eruption.
or,
Volcanic eruption is underway with no or minor ash emission.
[specify ash-plume height if possible] 
RED
Eruption is forecast to be imminent with significant emission of ash into the 
atmosphere likely.
or,
Eruption is underway with significant emission of ash into the atmosphere.
[specify ash-plume height if possible] 
Volcanic ash is a form of silica which has a relatively low melting point.  The hazards it presents 
to aviation are:
•	 Engine flame out
•	 Reduced visibility
•	 Scoring of windscreens
•	 Pitot blockage
•	 ‘Sandblast’ effect on the airframe and antennae
It should also be noted that volcanic ash is a very fine powder which, if inhaled, can cause 
severe respiratory problems.

Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centres (TCAC)
Six regional specialized meteorological centres (RSMCs) have been established to monitor, track 
and advise on tropical cyclones within their areas of responsibility.  Additionally around the 
Australia area 6 tropical cyclone warning centres (TCWCs) exist to provide the same function 
(see map).  These centres will issue warning messages which the meteorological watch offices 
may reissue as SIGMET (WC).

Does the following report make sense?
	
LSZH VRB02KT 5000 MIFG 02/02 Q1015 NOSIG
a.	
The report would never be seen, because shallow fog is not reported when 
the meteorological visibility is more than 2 km
b.	
The report is nonsense, because it is impossible to observe a meteorological 
visibility of 5 km if shallow fog is reported
c.	
The report is not possible, because, with a temperature of 2°C and a dew 
point of 2°C there must be uniform fog
d.	
The report is possible, because shallow fog is defined as a thin layer of fog 
below eye level

Meteorological Information for Aircraft in Flight
Introduction
The weather-briefing material and services that you have read about in this book, so far, 
enable a pilot to obtain information on forecast or actual weather conditions, prior to getting 
airborne, during flight planning.  However, pilots are also able to obtain weather information 
when they are in the air, by tuning into appropriate frequencies on the aircraft’s radio.
One of these in-flight weather briefing services is the VOLMET.  The first element of the 
code VOLMET, vol, is the French word for flight.  VOLMET, therefore, is a term signifying 
meteorological information for aircraft in flight.
VOLMET broadcasts are ground-to-air radio transmissions of meteorological reports and 
forecasts made on the High Frequency (HF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) bands.  These 
transmissions are broadcast in plain language, and give the latest weather reports and 
forecasts, in the form of spoken METARs, TAFs and SIGMETs.  VOLMET broadcasts transmit 
weather information for a number of different aerodromes, sequentially.  As a result, the pilot 
may have to wait for the forecast for the aerodrome pertinent to his flight to come around.
VOLMET Operation
The following table is an extract from the United Kingdom Aeronautical Information 
Publication (GEN Section), containing a list of VHF VOLMET services and their associated radio 
frequencies for the United Kingdom and the near continent.
Figure 29.1

Individual VOLMET stations, in each region, broadcast weather reports and forecasts for a 
group of major aerodromes in their region of responsibility.
From Figure 29.1 you can see that there are four UK VOLMET stations: LONDON VOLMET 
MAIN, LONDON VOLMET NORTH, LONDON VOLMET SOUTH and the SCOTTISH VOLMET. 
Next to each of these stations, is the frequency on which the VOLMET transmission is broadcast, 
the operating hours, and the list of aerodromes covered by the broadcast.  The LONDON 
VOLMET MAIN broadcast, for example, is transmitted on the VHF frequency of 135.375 MHz, 
continuously, over a 24 hour period.
The content of each VOLMET broadcast is a set of pre-recorded weather elements.  VOLMET 
broadcasts are updated every half hour.
You will also see from Figure 29.1 that the LONDON VOLMET MAIN broadcast contains 
weather information for aerodromes in France and the Republic of Ireland, as well as in the 
United Kingdom.  The LONDON VOLMET SOUTH broadcast contains weather information 
for major airfields between Birmingham, in the Midlands, and the island of Jersey, in the 
English Channel. 
Column 6 of Figure 29.1 details the specific weather elements which are included in the 
VOLMET broadcasts.  You will notice that the broadcast content has the same format as that 
of a METAR; however, in Figure 29.3 which contains examples of actual VOLMET broadcasts, 
you will notice that TAF-terminology (BECMG, TEMPO) is also used, giving the broadcast a 
forecast element, too.

The Shannon VOLMET is a vital source of weather information for North Atlantic flight routes.
The types of VOLMETs shown contain the same information as the VOLMETs for mainland 
United Kingdom, although they are more likely also to contain additional weather forecast 
details, such as SIGMETS for en route weather.
VOLMET transmissions are designed to be simple and easily understood, so that fast, efficient 
weather briefing can be obtained by pilots, in flight.
During preflight planning, note down the VOLMET frequencies for the areas that you will be 
flying in, so that, en route, you can listen to broadcasts for aerodromes in the vicinity of your 
destination, as well as for alternate aerodromes. 
Access to VOLMET broadcasts enables the pilot to confirm that weather conditions at his 
destination airfield are favourable.  If a diversion becomes necessary, the current suitability of 
the planned diversion airfield can also be rapidly determined.
ATIS Introduction
The Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) is a continuous broadcast of current 
aerodrome weather and other aerodrome information.
The purpose of the ATIS is to improve controller effectiveness and to reduce congestion on 
busy ground, tower and approach frequencies by automatically transmitting on a discrete 
VHF radio frequency.
Pilots departing from or arriving at aerodromes which offer ATIS are encouraged to listen to 
the ATIS broadcast and to notify air traffic control, on initial contact, that they have received 
the ATIS broadcast, by passing the phonetic alphabet code letter by which all ATIS broadcasts 
are identified.
At some aerodromes there will be a separate ATIS broadcast for departure and  arrival.
In order to free up air traffic VHF communication frequencies, some aerodromes transmit the 
ATIS information on the voice channel of a VOR beacon located at the aerodrome.

Figure 29.4 
Shown in Figure 29.4 is an extract from the Aerodrome section of the United Kingdom 
Aeronautical Information Publication (UK AIP) illustrating that both an arrival and departure 
ATIS is available, on different frequencies, at Manchester Airport.
The following extract shows that, at Southampton Airport, the ATIS broadcast is made on the 
Southampton VOR frequency.
Figure 29.5 
ATIS Operation
If the current aerodrome weather conditions change, or if there is any change in other pertinent 
aerodrome information, the ATIS broadcast is immediately updated to reflect these changes.  The 
updated ATIS broadcast is then given a new, sequential alphabetical code.  For example, ATIS 
broadcast BRAVO will have replaced the previous ATIS broadcast ALPHA.

On initial contact with Air Traffic Control (ATC), a pilot is required to state the identifying letter 
code of the ATIS information last received, in order that ATC may know that the pilot has the most 
recent information.
ATIS will be broadcast in plain language and will contain some or all of the following information, if 
applicable.
•	 Aerodrome name.
•	 ATIS sequence designator or information code.
•	 Time of observation.
•	 Runway in use and status.
•	 Surface wind in knots and referenced to magnetic north.
•	 Visibility and RVR.
•	 Present weather.
•	 Significant cloud.
•	 Temperature and dew point.
•	 Altimeter setting.
•	 Transition level.
•	 Type of approach expected.
•	 And finally any warnings pertinent to flight operations.
Use of ATIS
On departure from an aerodrome, ATIS information should be obtained by the pilot before initial 
contact with Air Traffic Control.  When initial contact is made with Air Traffic Control, the pilot must 
mention the identifying letter of the ATIS broadcast obtained, in order to confirm to the controller that 
the latest airfield information has been received.
A pilot arriving at an aerodrome should also listen to the ATIS broadcast before transmitting on the 
aerodrome’s initial contact frequency.  On hearing that a pilot has the latest ATIS information, an 
approach controller may omit, in his reply to the pilot, certain details contained in the ATIS broadcast. 
Normally, however, the aerodrome QNH will always be confirmed by the controller.
If a pilot does not acknowledge receipt of the latest ATIS broadcast on initial contact with an aerodrome 
controller, the controller will pass the essential aerodrome information to the pilot.
Obtaining the latest ATIS information helps ensure that radio transmissions between Air Traffic 
Control and the pilot are kept to a minimum.  This is especially important in busy airspace where 
radio transmissions must be kept short to allow for effective communication between controllers and 
all the aircraft to which they are giving a service.
