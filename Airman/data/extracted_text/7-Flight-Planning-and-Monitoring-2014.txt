Air Information Publications
Introduction
As part of basic preparation before any flight, pilots need to be able to brief themselves about:
•	 Air Traffic Control procedures regarding departure, en route, destination and alternate 
airfields.
•	 Frequencies of communication and navigation aids (navaids) en route and at airfields.
•	 Radio navigation and approach aids.
•	 Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS), Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) 
and in-flight weather services.
•	 Danger, Restricted and Prohibited Areas; Military training areas, Air Navigation Obstacles 
and Aerial Sporting and Recreational Activities.
In many operations offices and flight planning rooms a lot of this information is available on 
wall boards, often in the form of maps. Also, much of it will be available on printed maps and 
charts, such as those produced by Jeppesen and AERAD, amongst others.
However, these are secondary sources. Jeppesen and AERAD (and others) are not the authority 
on airspace, frequencies, and navigation aids. They merely print and reproduce, in an easily 
accessible form, information extracted from documents produced by the national aviation 
authority of that country (CAA, FAA, DGAC, etc). It is this national aviation authority which is 
the primary source.
These primary source documents are:
Air Information Publication (AIP). A publication issued by or with the authority of a State and 
containing aeronautical information of a lasting character essential to air navigation.
The United Kingdom Air Information Publication is an example.
AIP Supplements. Temporary changes to the information contained in the AIP which are 
published by means of special pages.
In the UK these are printed on yellow paper and filed in the AIP SUPPLEMENT SECTION of the 
UK AIP, GENERAL (GEN) volume.
NOTAM. A notice distributed by means of telecommunications containing information 
concerning the establishment, condition or change in any aeronautical facility, service, 
procedure or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with 
flight operations.
A NOTAM is originated and issued promptly whenever information to be distributed is of a 
temporary nature and short duration or when operationally significant permanent changes 
of long duration are made at short notice. They are displayed in, or issued by, operations and 
flight planning centres.

Format of an AIP
The format of an AIP produced by an ICAO contracting state conforms to a common standard 
in accordance with the Standards and Recommended Practices (SARP) of Annex 15 to the 
Convention on International Civil Aviation and with the Aeronautical Information Services 
Manual (ICAO Doc 8126). Thus the Air Information Publication United Kingdom is a typical 
reference document. It is divided into:
•	 VOLUME I - AIP PART 1, GENERAL (GEN) and AIP SUPPLEMENTS (AIP SUP)
•	 VOLUME II - AIP PART 2, EN ROUTE (ENR)
•	 VOLUME III - AIP PART 3, AERODROMES (AD)

Agency Designator, three letters, and Office Designator, one letter, may be added after the 
Location Indicator. This allows messages to be directed to an agency and/or an office at a 
particular location.
For example the Agency Designators for an Air Traffic Control Unit and a Flight Information 
Centre, at any location, are ZAZ and ZIZ; the Office Designators at any location for Freight 
and Cargo and Passenger Handling are F and P.
Normally, for day to day operations, pilots need to be aware only of the significance of the 
Location Indicator, particularly when filing a Flight Plan (CA48), where the entries for departure, 
destination and diversion airfields, and FIR/UIR boundaries, are represented by a particular 
four-letter code.
AIP GEN - NOTAMS (Notices to Airmen)
(Ref. UK AIP GEN 3.1)
All operationally significant information not covered by AIP Amendment or AIP Supplement 
will be issued as a NOTAM.
All operationally significant changes issued as Aeronautical Regulation and Control (AIRAC) 
AIP Amendments, AIP Supplements or Aviation Information Circulars (AIC) will be additionally 
announced by “Trigger” NOTAMS, which remain valid for 15 days after a permanent change 
and for the complete duration of any temporary change or condition.
Three categories of NOTAMS are disseminated by the Aeronautical Fixed Service (AFS):
•	 NOTAMN, which contains new information. 
•	 NOTAMR, which replaces a previous one.
•	 NOTAMC, which cancels a previous one. 
UK NOTAMS are divided into two categories:
•	 Those containing information on UK International Airports and en route information of 
interest to both international and domestic recipients. (A to H, J and exceptionally X).
•	 Those containing information on domestic aerodromes and information to domestic 
recipients only. (L to N, R and exceptionally X).
Edited Example NOTAMS:
•	 Series A

Figure 1.2 Extract from AD 2 UK AIP.
The Flight Information Service (FIS) (Figure 1.2) is provided at aerodromes to give information 
useful for the safe and efficient conduct of flights in the Aerodrome Traffic Zone (ATZ). From 
the information received pilots will be able to decide the appropriate course of action to be 
taken to ensure the safety of the flight.
FIS is available during the aerodrome’s operation hours. The Flight Information Service officer 
is responsible for:
•	 Issuing information to aircraft in the ATZ to assist pilots in preventing collisions.
•	 Issuing information to aircraft on the manoeuvring area to assist pilots in preventing 
collisions between aircraft and vehicles/obstructions on the manoeuvring area, or between 
aircraft moving on the apron.
•	 Informing aircraft of essential aerodrome information (i.e. the state of the aerodrome and 
its facilities).
•	 Alerting the safety services.
•	 Initiating overdue action.

Air Information Publications
At busy airfields to alleviate Radio-telephony (RTF) loading on the operational channels, 
Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) (Figure 1.2) broadcast messages are used to 
pass routine arrival/departure information on a discrete RTF frequency or on an appropriate 
VOR. Pilots of aircraft inbound to these airports are required on first contact with the 
aerodrome ATS Unit to acknowledge receipt of current information by quoting the code 
letter of the broadcast. Pilots of outbound aircraft are not normally required to acknowledge 
receipt of departure ATIS but are requested to ensure that they are in possession of up-to-date 
information. (See ICAO Doc 7030 for further information on ATIS).
EXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL ATIS AT OXFORD/KIDLINGTON:
“ATIS B: Runway 02 right hand; Helicopter Area 1 Left; Surface W/V 330/10; QNH1018, QFE 
1008; Temperature -1°C, Dewpoint -3°C. Contact tower on 121.95 MHz.”
AIP GEN - Meteorological Charts
(Ref.UK AIP GEN 3.5)
National Meteorological Offices routinely issue written forecasts of selected areas at fixed times 
daily. For the UK, these are on Forms F214 and F215. The UK Met Office also issues European 
and North Atlantic forecasts. Details of areas of coverage and times of issue and the periods of 
validity are given in the UK AIP.
AIP GEN - Meteorological Information
Aviation Routine Weather Reports-METAR/(Actuals), Aerodrome Forecasts-TAF, information 
concerning en route weather phenomena which may affect the safety of aircraft operations-
SIGMET (including volcanic activity), and selected special weather reports- SPECI, are broadcast 
by teleprinter and/or radio throughout the UK and internationally in text form.
The Meteorological Watch Offices (MWOs) are responsible for preparing and disseminating 
SIGMETS to the appropriate ACC/FIC within their own and agreed adjacent FIRs. Aircraft in 
flight should be warned of the occurrence or expected occurrence of a SIGMET phenomenon 
for the route ahead for up to 500 NM or 2 hours flying time. SIGMET examples are:
•	 At subsonic levels 
•	 Freezing Rain
•	 Severe Mountain Wave
•	 Volcanic Ash Cloud
•	 At transonic and supersonic levels (FL250-600) 
•	 Hail
•	 Volcanic Ash Cloud
•	 Moderate or Severe Turbulence
Information to aircraft in flight is usually supplied in accordance with area Meteorological 
Watch procedures, supplemented when necessary by an En Route Forecast Service. 
Information is also available from the appropriate ATS Unit at the commander’s request, or 
from meteorological broadcasts.

Questions may be asked on the frequencies and call signs of particular navigation aids. As an 
example, ENR4 of the UK AIP lists the en route radio navigation aids alphabetically, together 
with their individual identifying morse call signs, transmitting frequencies, operational hours, 
DME aerial elevation, where applicable, and any remarks. Thus:
•	 A VHF Omni-range (VOR) and a Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) are situated at Saint 
Abbs Head where in 1995 the magnetic variation was 5.5°W; the VOR beacon is aligned 
with magnetic north.
•	 The morse call sign is Sierra Alpha Bravo.
•	 The VOR frequency to be selected by a civil operator is 112.50 MHz which also activates the 
DME’s interrogator/transponder UHF frequencies; military aircraft select channel 72X to 
obtain range from the DME.
•	 The station operates continuously 24 hours a day at,
•	 The published latitude and longitude in degrees minutes and seconds.
•	 The DME antenna is 760 ft above mean sea level.
•	 Neither the VOR nor the DME should be used beyond 50 NM and above 50 000 ft or 200 NM 
and 50 000 ft in the sector between 054°(M) and 144°(M).

AIP AD - Aerodrome Categorization
(Ref. UK AIP AD 1.4)
In the UK there are two types of civil aerodrome licence namely, PUBLIC USE LICENCE and 
ORDINARY LICENCE.
Aerodromes or heliports operated in accordance with a PUBLIC USE LICENCE must have their 
hours of availability notified in the UK AIP and the aerodrome/heliport must be available to all 
operators on certain equal terms and conditions. However, this does not necessarily mean that 
the aerodrome is available to all flights without limitation. Aircraft operators must check and 
comply with the requirements and conditions of use indicated at AD 2 or 3.
Aerodromes or heliports operated in accordance with an ORDINARY LICENCE may accept 
flights operated by the holder of the licence or by those specifically authorized by that licence 
holder. This normally means that prior permission is required for most flights but it does not 
exclude the possibility of scheduled or non-scheduled public transport flights being arranged 
after the formal agreement of the licence holder.

Air Information Publications
From the table opposite:
•	 Bournemouth has a Category I Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runways 08 (call sign 
I BMH) and 26 (call sign I BH). The Localizer (LLZ) frequency for either runway system is 
110.50 MHz; the paired glide path (GP) frequency for each is 329.60 MHz. The ILS hours of 
operation are denoted as HO, which means that the service is available to meet operational 
requirements. The antenna co-ordinates, published in the remarks column, are given in 
degrees, minutes, seconds and hundredths of latitude and longitude.
The remarks column also states that the glide slope for each ILS is 3°, and that the ILS Ref 
Datum Hgt (Reference Datum Height ) for runway 08 and 26 is 53 ft and 50 ft.
“The ILS reference datum point is a point at a specified height (around 50 ft) located 
vertically above the intersection of the runway centre line and threshold, through which 
the downward extended portion of the ILS glide path extends.”
The remarks column for the ILS also publishes the localizer limitations for runway 08 and 
states, for the ILS on runway 26, that ”The quality of guidance provided does not permit use 
of the facility for coupled approaches below 350 ft.”
•	 L in the Type Column indicates that the airfield has a low powered Non-directional Beacon 
(NDB), known as a Locator, sited on the aerodrome (AD) at the published latitude and 
longitude; its call sign is BIA, frequency 339 kHz and operational hours H24 (continuous 
service). Range 20 NM in the remarks column is the promulgated range or Designated 
Operational coverage (DOC):
“The range promulgated for UK NDBs is based upon a daytime signal protection ratio 
between wanted and unwanted signals that limits bearing errors at that distance to +/- 5°. 
At ranges greater than those promulgated bearing errors will increase. Adverse propagation 
conditions particularly at night will also increase bearing errors. This protection takes into 
account average atmospheric noise but not night-time sky waves.”
See the latest AIC on Radio Navigation Aids - Designated Operational Coverage.
•	 The DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) is frequency paired with ILS I BMH (RWY 08) and 
I BH (RWY 26). Ch (channel number) 42X is the selection for military TACAN (TACtical Air 
Navigation) equipped aircraft. The operational hours are HO and the aerial elevation is 44 ft 
AMSL. With reference to the Remarks column, Zero range is indicated at the threshold of 
runway 26 and 160 m before crossing the threshold of runway 08.
Other Sources
Publications such as Aerad and Jeppesen Flight Guides, Low and High Level Airways Charts, 
Arrival and Departure Charts and Airfield Approach Charts all, variously, provide information 
on airfield opening hours, handling, communication and radio navigation and landing aids etc.

Universal Application of Fuel Policy
You are shortly about to start practical planning examples on the Single-engine Piston, the 
Multi-engine Piston and the Medium Range Jet Transport aircraft. As you will find out, we 
enter various tables and graphs for these aircraft types and, from these, we are able to work 
out how much fuel will be used for a particular length of flight under different conditions of 
aircraft weight, air temperature and wind component. In general, these predictions are quite 
accurate as long as the meteorological conditions experienced are close to the forecast values 
used to produce the plan. We call this the Trip Fuel.
On its own, however, this is not enough. If we had just the trip fuel on board at the moment 
of take-off, the engine would stop because of fuel starvation the moment we arrived at the 
destination, which is obviously not an acceptable way to operate. Clearly, we need some fuel 
other than the minimum to just do the trip. After all, we start using fuel before take-off. We 
have to consider start-up and taxi. We also need reserve fuel, firstly in case the trip does not go 
as planned, and secondly in order to taxi in and shut down.
The principles which establish how much fuel should be carried on an air transport flight have 
been internationally agreed and are laid down in CS-OPS 1. Whilst the actual amounts vary 
from aircraft type to type, because different aircraft have different fuel consumptions, the rules 
by which the minima for each flight are calculated are universal.
This is known as EASA Fuel Policy.
Realistic Trip Fuel
Whatever the commercial pressures to carry minimum fuel, there is no point in coming up 
with an unrealistically low figure for trip fuel. It has to be based on what you actually expect 
to happen. This means taking into account, for instance, the most likely routing, rather than a 
straight line route from departure to destination. If the departure airport insists on Standard 
Instrument Departures (SIDs) or the destination airport insists on Standard Instrument Arrivals 
(STARs), as is normal, then the SIDs and STARs may add tens of miles of track distance to the 
en route portion of the trip. These should be included in calculating the trip fuel. In particular, 
the following points should be noted:
The operator shall ensure that the planning of flights is based only upon:
•	 Procedures and data derived from the Operations Manual or current aeroplane specific 
data.
•	 The conditions under which the flight is to be conducted, including:
•	 Realistic fuel flows expressed as kg/h, lb/h or gal/h;
•	 The aircraft’s anticipated weights (masses)
•	 Expected meteorological conditions; and
•	 Air Traffic Service procedures and restrictions

EASA Fuel Policy - Breakdown of Fuel
Under EASA fuel policy, fuel is considered under the following breakdown:
Taxi
Trip
Reserves 
which are further broken down into:
Contingency
Alternate
Final Reserve
Additional
Extra
Taxi Fuel
The amount required to start up, taxi, and hold (if necessary) before take-off. It will also include 
any fuel required to operate pre-flight services, such as cabin conditioning, and may include use 
of the APU. In the Boeing 737, for instance, 260 kg of Taxi Fuel is allowed. This is over a quarter 
of a tonne of fuel before take-off.
Trip Fuel
This should include fuel:
•	 For the take-off from the airfield elevation, the departure procedure (SID) and thence to 
the top of climb (TOC) at the initial cruising level/altitude.
•	 From the TOC to top of descent (TOD), including any step climbs or descents.
•	 From TOD to the point where the approach is initiated; account is taken of expected arrival 
procedures (STARs).
•	 For approach and landing.
Reserve Fuel
Reserve Fuel is further subdivided into:
•	 Contingency Fuel 
•	 Alternate Fuel 
•	 Final Reserve 
•	 Additional Fuel
Each of these will be dealt with separately shortly.
Extra Fuel
Extra Fuel is any fuel above the minima required by Taxi, Trip and Reserve Fuel. It can simply 
be because more has been uplifted than is required for the trip, so the surplus is defined as 
Extra Fuel or, more usually, it can be because, even when all the minima required by EASA fuel 
policy are carried, the aircraft commander decides that more is needed because of particular 
circumstances.

Fuel Policy and Fuel Monitoring
Reserve Fuel
Contingency Fuel
An operator must ensure that every flight carries sufficient fuel for the planned operation, 
and reserves to cover any replanning necessary for in-flight contingencies. A contingency is 
a chance occurrence or unforeseen event. Contingency Fuel is carried to compensate for 
deviations:
•	 Of an individual aircraft from the expected fuel consumption data
•	 From the forecast meteorological conditions
•	 From the planned routing and/or cruising levels/altitudes.
Alternate Fuel
Alternate Fuel is simply the fuel required to fly from missed approach at the destination to the 
planned alternate. It should take into account probable routing and expected wind component, 
but it does not have its own allowance of contingency fuel. Contingency allowance is applied 
only to the trip fuel.
Final Reserve Fuel
If you fly from departure to destination, use the contingency fuel en route, and then have 
a missed approach at the destination and fly to the alternate, you will have no fuel left on 
arrival. We therefore have a minimum landing fuel, and you should normally never land with 
less than the Final Reserve Fuel. It consists of 30 min (jet/turboprop) at 1500’ above AAL in ISA 
conditions, or 45 min (piston engine aircraft) fuel consumption at endurance speed.
Additional Fuel
Contingency, Alternate and Final Reserve fuel cover most cases, and provided that suitable 
diversions are available en route and near the destination, this is all that is required for Reserve 
Fuel. There are two cases, however, where Additional Fuel may be needed:
No Alternate 
This is also known as the “Island Holding” situation. If there is no alternate available at some 
isolated aerodrome, then you need to be able to cope with the aircraft landing two minutes 
ahead of you bursting a tyre on the runway, or possibly a short duration tropical squall going 
through.
No En Route Alternate and Inability to Hold Height
If you are a long way from an alternate and you suffer some malfunction which requires you 
to reduce to a lower altitude (engine failure or pressurization failure or both), you may have 
to fly a long portion of the flight at a higher fuel consumption than planned. In this case you 
may need Additional Fuel.
EU-OPS policy states minimum Additional Fuel should be sufficient to permit:
a.  If an engine fails or the pressurization is lost at the most critical point, the aircraft to descend 
as necessary and proceed to an adequate alternate aerodrome and hold at 1500 ft for 15 
minutes above the aerodrome elevation in ISA conditions 
except that this additional fuel is not required if adequate basic trip, contingency, alternate 
and final reserve is sufficient to complete the above profile and
--- Page 33 ---

Fuel Policy and Fuel Monitoring

Fuel Policy and Fuel Monitoring
b.  Holding for 15 minutes at 1500 ft above the destination aerodrome in ISA conditions when 
a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome
On most flights Additional Fuel is not required but in either of the above cases, it may be 
necessary.
Calculation of Contingency Fuel
Numerical calculation of taxi, trip, alternate and final reserve fuels is fairly straightforward. Taxi 
fuel is usually a standard allowance. Trip fuel and alternate fuel are extracted from graphs or 
tables from the appropriate Operational Flight Manual. We will practise this process in Chapters 
3, 4 and 5. Final reserve fuel is a simple calculation based on 30 (jet/turboprop) or 45 (piston) 
minutes hold at endurance speed. However, contingency fuel can vary depending on the type 
of operation.
Contingency Fuel is the higher of A and B below:
A
As agreed with the appropriate national aviation authority:
•	 5% of the planned trip fuel, or, in the event of in-flight replanning, 5% of the trip fuel for the 
remainder of the flight. No en route alternative is needed in this case.
•	 If the operator has a fuel monitoring programme and agrees a particular method of 
statistical analysis which includes standard deviations (the details need not concern us for 
the purposes of the ATPL), this can be reduced yet further by agreement with the authority.
B
An amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1500 ft (450 m) above the destination 
aerodrome in standard conditions.
For the most part the contingency Fuel will be based on 5% of trip fuel but be aware of the 
alternate B because questions do occur when holding for 5 minutes at 1500 ft will be a HIGHER 
figure.

Fuel Monitoring
Having planned the expected fuel consumption, we now have to ensure that the aircraft is 
performing closely to the plan, and take appropriate action if it does not.
A commander must ensure that fuel checks are carried out in flight at regular intervals. The 
fuel remaining must be recorded and evaluated to:
•	 Compare actual consumption with planned consumption
•	 Check that the remaining fuel is sufficient to complete the flight
•	 Determine the expected fuel remaining on arrival at the destination
The relevant fuel data must be recorded.
If, as a result of an in-flight fuel check, the expected fuel remaining on arrival at the destination 
is less than the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel, the commander must take into 
account the traffic and the operational conditions prevailing at the destination airfield, along 
the diversion route to an alternate aerodrome and at the destination alternate aerodrome, 
when deciding to proceed to the destination aerodrome or to divert, so as to land with not 
less than final reserve fuel.
Modern major carriers use computer flight planning. Either they install their own dedicated 
ground flight planning computer, such as BA’s CIRRUS system or Lufthansa’s LIDO system, 
or they subscribe to a commercially available system such as JETPLAN. The computer output 
is usually in the form of large sheets of fanfold paper and a typical print-out is shown on the 
next page. Line 18 in this example is a list of the titles of each column and the last entry is 
“REM”. This means “Fuel Remaining”. Look down the columns and you will see that for each 
waypoint (KONAN, KOKSY, REMBA, etc) there is a REM value (0045, 0043, 0038, etc). This is 
the minimum fuel that should remain (in hundreds of kilogrammes) overhead the waypoint 
(i.e. 4500 kg, 4300 kg, 3800 kg, etc). All that the pilot has to do is check as he passes over each 
waypoint that the fuel remaining is not less than the flight plan fuel and he then knows that 
he has sufficient to complete the trip and arrive with appropriate reserves.

Fuel Policy and Fuel Monitoring
For longer flights, it is also necessary to keep a track on the fuel consumption trend. We may 
have adequate reserves at the start of a trip but if the fuel consumption rate is higher than 
forecast we may go below the minimum requirement at a later stage of the flight. We need to 
have adequate early warning of the fuel flow as well as the total quantity.
On sophisticated modern aircraft this is accomplished by use of the Flight Management 
System. The fuel contents and the fuel flow-meter readings are passed directly into the Flight 
Management Computer (FMC). The FMC also knows the route distance to go, the current 
ground speed and the anticipated descent profile. From this it can work out the expected fuel 
on arrival. This is available for the pilots to check at any time. This expected arrival fuel is also 
compared with the sum of the alternate fuel and the final reserve fuel. If it goes below this 
sum, a warning to the pilots is displayed on the Control and Display Unit (CDU).
For aircraft without an FMS, the ‘Howgozit’ fuel graph is the usual method. A graph is drawn 
with ‘Fuel Remaining’ as the ‘y’ axis and ‘Distance to Go’ as the ‘x’ axis. See the example at 
Figure 2.2.
Note: Questions on the ‘Howgozit’ are not set in the EASA exam. This is simply to help your 
understanding of fuel monitoring.
In this example, we are assuming that we have a flight of 1000 nautical ground miles. We have 
to land with 1000 kg (our final reserve fuel) and the fuel required to fly to the alternate is 
700 kg. Therefore our minimum on arrival at the destination is 1700 kg.
(Just out of interest, note that the slope changes shortly after the start. This is because aircraft 
usually climb at a slower speed than cruise, but the engines are at or near max continuous 
power in the climb but at cruise power when level).
We are expecting to use 5000 kg en route, so this is our trip fuel. Our contingency will be 5% 
of the remaining trip fuel, so this will be 250 kg at the start of the trip, reducing to zero at the 
end. Our minimum take-off fuel is therefore 6950 kg.
Now, although we must have our contingency fuel on board, very often we do not use it. 
After all, the trip fuel is supposed to be based on a realistic figure. Therefore the contingency is 
only to cover unforeseen fuel consumption deviations, incorrect met forecasts and unexpected 
ATC re-routing. On the majority of trips, these should not occur. In these cases, the fuel will 
track down the ‘probable fuel consumption’ line and we will arrive with the contingency fuel 
unused.
During the flight we take fuel checks every half hour (or other interval, as specified in the 
company’s  Flight Operations Manual).  From these we build up the history of the fuel 
consumption and establish a trend. Extrapolating the slope will indicate to us the expected 
arrival fuel if the trend continues. In Figure 2.3, for instance, we are going to arrive with 
sufficient fuel. In Figure 2.4, we are not. In this case, appropriate action would have to be 
considered, such as returning to the departure airfield or diverting to a suitable en route 
airfield to up-lift fuel.

Figure 2.4   Insufficient fuel
A check of the aircraft’s fuel system may be required if it was thought that the excess 
consumption was caused by a fuel leak or a fuel-gauge fault. An error in computation at 
flight planning or in the actual fuel amount up-lifted at departure may have been the cause 
of the short- fall. Aircraft have run short of fuel. Very strong un-forecast headwinds have been 
encountered. Pounds to kilograms, kilograms to pounds, have been erroneously converted 
and specific gravities applied incorrectly!
Special Cases  1 – Decision Point Procedure
There is a special case when we may get airborne without sufficient contingency fuel for the 
planned trip to the destination. This is called decision point procedure.
Decision Point Procedure - A Typical Scenario
Consider the ‘Howgozit’ in Figure 2.6. A flight from Oxford to Faro, in southern Portugal, is 
planned. There are alternates near Faro - Seville or Jerez, for instance. The total of the final 
reserve fuel and the alternate fuel is 3000 kg. The trip fuel is exactly 10 000 kg. There is a 
suitable en route diversion at Lisbon, so contingency fuel is 3%, which comes to 300 kg. This 
means that we need 13 300 kg at take-off.
Unfortunately, the maximum capacity of our fuel tanks means that we can get in only 13 150 
kg at take-off. This is 150 kg short of the minimum requirement. Does this mean that we cannot 
do this flight? Not necessarily, if there is a suitable en route alternate.
We define the top of descent for going into Lisbon, our alternate, as the Decision Point. We 
have plenty of fuel to proceed to Lisbon, so this is legal. At this Decision Point, we carry out a 
fuel check. Unless unforeseen circumstances have arisen, we will probably not have used the 
contingency fuel and so will still have 150 kg above the expected consumption line for Faro.

Fuel Policy and Fuel Monitoring
The requirement for contingency fuel is 3% above the trip fuel required for the remainder of 
the flight, not the start trip fuel. At this stage of the trip, the required contingency fuel is only 
55 kg. If the fuel remaining includes this 55 kg contingency fuel plus the remainder of the trip 
fuel for Faro (along with the usual alternate fuel and final reserve fuel), we continue to Faro. If 
the fuel remaining comes to less than this figure, we divert to our alternate, Lisbon.

Decision Point Procedure should not be attempted unless the departure fuel is sufficient to 
guarantee a reasonable expectation of there being enough fuel remaining at the Decision Point 
to permit continuation to the scheduled destination. The success of a Decision Point Procedure 
will depend on whether unforeseen events, such as not being cleared to the optimum cruise 
level or avoidance of weather, have caused the contingency fuel allowance to be used. The 
normal non-consumption of contingency fuel, which can be a considerable amount (usually 3% 
at least of the fuel between departure and Decision Point), permits Decision Point Procedure 
to be feasible and safe.

Comparing the Decision Point Procedure fuel requirement with the normal fuel requirements, 
the maximum fuel reduction available is the contingency fuel (3% or 5% of trip fuel) between 
Departure and Decision Point.
Alternatively, we can say that contingency fuel can be reduced down to that required 
between Decision Point and Destination.

Special Cases 2 – Isolated Aerodrome Procedure
An ‘Isolated’ aerodrome is defined as an aerodrome for which there is no Destination Alternate. 
An island in an ocean is a good example, for instance, Easter Island in the South Pacific. In this 
case the aircraft might have to hold for longer than usual (e.g. in the case of a blocked runway 
or a tropical storm passing through) with no option of diverting. Reserves normally consist of 
contingency fuel, alternate fuel and final reserve fuel. In the case of an Isolated aerodrome 
there is no alternate, so there is no alternate fuel. Instead, for a jet or turboprop aircraft, the 
combination of final reserve fuel and additional fuel must comprise enough fuel to fly for two 
hours at normal cruise consumption after arriving at the destination aerodrome. CS-OPS 1 
specifies that the fuel must include:
•	 Taxi fuel
•	 Trip fuel
•	 Contingency fuel
•	 Additional fuel if required but not less than:
•	 For aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the 
flight time planned to be spent at cruising level, or two hours, whichever is less.
•	 For aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for two hours at normal cruise consumption 
after arriving overhead the destination aerodrome, including the final reserve fuel.

Nautical Air Miles
Many of the graphs for the Single-engine Piston (SEP), Multi-engine Piston (MEP) and, later, 
the Medium Range Jet Transport (MRJT) aircraft, refer to nautical air miles (NAM). They are a 
measure of the air distance flown by an aircraft, i.e. the distance flown at the True Airspeed 
(TAS). In still air (or when there is no wind component along the aircraft’s heading vector) 
the NAM flown are equal to the Nautical Ground Distance (NGM) flown. NGM is the distance 
flown by the aircraft over the ground, as may be measured on a chart.
Usually the air is moving and an aircraft flying through this moving air will fly a different distance 
over the ground. If the air is moving in the opposite direction to the aircraft (a headwind, or 
minus wind component) then the aircraft will fly more NAM than NGM. (See Figure 3.1.)
Figure 3.1  NAM greater than NGM
Similarly, if the wind is blowing in the direction that the aircraft is flying, (a tailwind or plus 
wind component ) the NAM will be less than NGM. (See Figure 3.2.)
Figure 3.2  NAM less than NGM
The relationship between NAM, NGM, TAS, GS (ground speed ) and wind component (WC) is:
NAM 
NGM
TAS 
GS

Example
An aircraft flies at TAS 142 kt for 63 NAM. If the WC is -20 kt, how many NGM does it fly?

NGM
TAS

=
63 
x
142 
122
=
x = 122/142 × 63 = 54
OR on your Navigation Computer
Red cursor: 142 on the inner scale is set against 122 on the outer. Blue cursor: 63 is read on the 
inner scale against 54 on the outer.
Figure 3.3  NAM to NGM using navigation computer
If the TAS (or GS) are not known, for example in a climb or descent, the conversion can still be 
carried out.
Consider an aircraft with a TAS of 100 kt:
In one hour it would fly 100 NAM. But in that hour the air has been moved by the wind 
component. If the WC is -25 (25 head), then the air has moved 25 NM in the direction from 
which the aircraft came. So the ground distance flown is:
100  -  25  =  75 NGM
Similarly, if the WC is +25 (25 tail) the ground distance is:
100  +  25  =  125 NGM
--- Page 51 ---

Nautical Air Miles

Nautical Air Miles
We can see that the difference between air and ground distance is the +/- WC per minutes 
flown, or:
+/- WC 
60
×   minutes flown
This gives the formula:
NGM  =  NAM  +/-  
WC 
60
×  sector time
(
)
Example
An aircraft climbs to cruising level in 11.5 minutes, covering 23.5 NAM. If the wind component 
is -30 kt, how many NGM are flown in the climb?
NGM  =  23.5  -  
30 
60
×  11.5
(
)
	
	
	
	
         =  23.5 – 5.75
	
	
	
	
         =  17.75 ( or 18 ) NGM

Single-engine Piston Aeroplane (SEP)
Introduction
The tables for SEP refer to a more complex aircraft than the Warrior. The SEP is a monoplane 
with a reciprocating engine. It has a constant speed propeller, propeller rpm being controlled 
by the pilot via an rpm (or pitch) lever. The fuel/ air mixture may be “rich“ (more fuel) or “lean” 
(less fuel). Total fuel/ air mixture going into the engine is adjusted by varying the manifold 
pressure; the higher the manifold pressure, the more mixture being burnt.
The SEP manifold pressure is measured in inches of mercury; e.g. “25.0 inHg”. As the aircraft 
climbs, the throttle lever must be advanced, manually, in order to maintain a desired pressure. 
Sometimes an engine device can add more fuel/ air mixture automatically, without the pilot 
moving the throttle lever. Eventually, in the climb, an altitude will be reached where manifold 
pressure can no longer be maintained. In this case, the throttle lever will remain at “maximum 
forward” and manifold pressure will start to reduce. This altitude is called “full throttle height” 
and the power is said to be at “full throttle“.
The SEP has a retractable undercarriage. The tables assume that the undercarriage is at the 
appropriate position for the stage of flight i.e. “down or extended” for landing and take-off, 
“up or retracted” for climb, cruise and descent. There is no requirement to consider abnormal 
cases.

(SEP) GRAPHS & TABLES
Please refer to CAP 697 where all the graphs and tables for SEP will be found.
NB.  In the EASA Flight Planning exam you will be issued with a workbook instead of the CAP 697
in which will be the necessary pages for that particular paper.
Each graph and table type within CAP 697 has an example to explain how the particular graph 
or table is used. Therefore, the method is not repeated in these notes.
SEP - Time, Fuel and Distance to Climb Data
(Ref.  CAP 697 Fig. 2.1.)
The graph gives time, fuel and distance (NAM) to climb to any height (as pressure altitude and 
OAT) from MSL. If the airport is at MSL, the climb data can be read from the graph in one pass. 
If the airport is not at sea level then you have to extract the data for the top of climb (TOC) or 
initial cruising level, then extract data for the airport and take the airport data away from your 
cruising level to get the correct figures.

Cruise Power Settings Tables
Each table in the Figure 2.2 series shows the performance data for a given power setting. For 
example, table 2.2.1 is for:
Manifold pressure of 25.0 inHg (mercury) @ 2500 rpm.
The data is given for three different ISA temperature deviations: STANDARD DAY, ISA +20°C 
and ISA -20°C. Note that above a certain altitude (full throttle height ), the stated manifold 
pressure cannot be produced by the engine and the tabulated values of manifold pressures 
(shaded areas) are approximately the maximum that can be expected.
The tables are used by turning to the page for the selected power setting and then selecting 
the appropriate Pressure Altitude and interpolating for each single degree of ISA Deviation to 
extract the necessary information.
Interpolation between pressure altitudes is required.

Range Profile Figure
This table gives an estimate of the maximum still air range, for each of four power settings, for 
a selected pressure altitude.
The calculated range includes fuel for:
•	 Climb
•	 Cruise
•	 Taxi and run-up, plus
•	 A reserve fuel for 45 minutes at economy cruise power
This table enables the pilot to rapidly select a suitable cruise level for a route distance and 
preferred power setting. It is also possible to select a power setting, given a preferred cruise 
altitude and route distance.
To use the table, enter on the left with cruising pressure altitude and move horizontally to the 
selected power setting curve. Move vertically downwards to read off the range in Nautical 
Air Miles.
You will note that on each power setting curve that TAS is quoted for Pressure Altitudes 
4000 ft, 8000 ft and 12 000 ft.  You may have to interpolate between these altitudes to extract 
an accurate TAS to use in the conversion of NAM to NGM.
Note. Range is affected by wind, therefore you will have to convert the NAM extracted from the 
graph into NGM, using the formula discussed in Chapter 3.

Endurance
The table gives endurance (how long the aircraft can remain airborne; not necessarily the time 
to achieve the maximum range). Use in a similar manner to Figure 2.4.
As this endurance includes a 45 minute reserve the endurance you extract is called a safe 
endurance.
Note. Endurance is NOT affected by wind.

Multi-engine Piston Aeroplane (MEP)
Introduction
Data sheets are provided for a multi-engine aircraft (MEP1). This is a monoplane with two 
reciprocating engines, twin counter-rotating constant speed propellers and a retractable 
undercarriage; similar to a Piper Seneca.
Maximum Take-off Mass (MTOM)	
	
	
	
4750 lb 
Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM)	
	
	
	
4470 lb 
(Mass of aircraft = crew and payload but no fuel)
Maximum Landing Mass (MLM)	
	
	
	
4513 lb
Maximum fuel load	
	
	
	
	
	
123 US.gal 
Assumed fuel density		
(Unless otherwise advised)	 6 lb/US.gal (SG.72)
Maximum fuel mass	 	
	
	
	
	
123 × 6 = 738 lb
(123 × .72 × 8.3 = 735 lb) 
The Power Settings of 75%, 65% and 45% equate to High Speed Cruise, Economy Cruise and 
Long Range Cruise. You will note that there is a fourth power setting of 55% which has no 
cruise description.
The data sheets are used in a similar manner to those for SEP1. The following paragraphs 
explain the use of the data sheets. 
NB.  In the Flight Planning exam you will be issued with a workbook instead of the CAP 697 in 
which will be the necessary pages for that particular paper.

MEP 1-Range at Standard Temperatures
(CAP 697 Figure 3.2)
Two values of air range can be extracted, with either 45 MIN. RESERVE FUEL AT 45% POWER 
(left-hand side of graph) or WITH NO RESERVE (right-hand side of graph).
NB. On the top right side of the graph is a power phrase to percentage translation. Eg. Economy 
power is 65%.
You also should correct the air range in accordance with the notes at the top left-hand side of 
the graph. The corrections are to add 1 NM for every degree above ISA and subtract 1 NM for 
every degree below ISA.
Remember range is affected by wind so you might have to convert NAMs into NGMs. If this 
occurs you will be given a TAS and a Wind Component to apply the NAM/NGM = TAS/GS 
formula.

MEP 1-Cruise Power Setting and Fuel Flow
(CAP 697 Figure 3.3)
Power settings are expressed as 75% (HIGH SPEED), 65% (ECONOMY), 55% AND 45% (LONG 
RANGE). TAS is extracted from the SPEED POWER table, figure 3.4.
Enter the table with the required % power to obtain fuel flow in US.gal/h
For example: Economy Power (65%) has a fuel flow of 23.3 US.gal/h. Given a time let us say of 
2 hours 30 minutes you can work out a trip fuel of 58.25 US.gal.
The manifold pressure is read off against pressure altitude and rpm in the correct % power 
column
Note that, for example, 75% power and a fuel flow of 29.0 GPH should be achieved at FL60 at:
•	 33.4 inHg @ 2500 rpm, or
•	 32.2 inHg @ 2600 rpm.
Also, that the fuel flow decreases as power decreases, thus giving greater range and endurance.
To correct for temperatures different from ISA:
For each 6°C above ISA, add 1% to tabulated manifold pressure.
For each 6°C below ISA, subtract 1% from tabulated manifold pressure.
Unlike the SEP power graphs the TAS is NOT extracted here, so a separate graph is provided for 
you to get your TAS.

MEP 1-Descent Fuel, Time and Distance
(CAP 697 Figure 3.6)
This table works in the same way as the climb table in that one entry will give the fuel, time 
and distance to descend from a pressure altitude (FL) to MSL. If the destination airfield is not at 
MSL, then a second entry is needed to extract data for a hypothetical descent from airfield FL 
to MSL. This data is subtracted from the former to give the actual descent fuel, time, distance.

Medium Range Jet Transport (MRJT) Simplified Flight Planning
Introduction
The performance database for a modern jet aircraft is invariably contained in the operating 
company’s flight planning computer set-up and the aircraft’s Flight Management System 
(FMS). The company Operation’s computers will produce flight plans for optimum routes and 
cruise modes, according to the instructions given. 
•	 Best direct track non-airways. 
•	 Best direct airways track. 
•	 Best North Atlantic track. 
•	 Least fuel or time track.
•	 Extended Range Operations (EROPS) and Non-normal Operations, such as gear down 
flight.
Crews use the FMS data base for in-flight fuel monitoring, and replanning of the aircraft’s 
performance when necessary, in order to obtain prompt accurate information and to reduce 
the need to refer to the relevant Operations Manual.
However, Part Flight Crew Licensing, Flight Planning & Monitoring (Aeroplanes), requires the 
student to be familiar with the reference material in the CAP 697 MRJT , which is based upon 
extracts from the Boeing 737-400 Operations Manual, and to answer related examination 
questions.
NB.  In the Flight Planning exam you will be issued with a workbook instead of the CAP 697 in 
which will be the necessary pages for your particular exam.
Aeroplane Data and Constants
The aeroplane is a monoplane with twin turbojet engines and a retractable undercarriage.
Structural Limits:
Maximum Ramp (Taxi) Mass (MRM)		
	
	
	
	
63 060 kg 
Maximum Take-off Mass (MTOM)

Maximum Landing Mass (MLM)	
	
	
	
	
	
54 900 kg 
Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM)	
	
	
	
	
	
51 300 kg 
Dry Operating Mass (DOM) (Average value, from source other than

Constants:
Fuel Density, unless otherwise stated:	
	
	
	
	
3.04 kg/US.gal	
6.7 lb/US.gal
From the foregoing data note the following:
•	 Maximum Take-off Mass (MTOM) is the maximum permissible total aeroplane mass at the 
start of the take-off run.
•	 Maximum Landing Mass (MLM) is the maximum total permissible landing mass upon 
landing under normal circumstances.
•	 Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM) is the maximum permissible mass of the aeroplane with 
no usable fuel.

Medium Range Jet Transport (MRJT) Simplified Flight Planning
•	 Dry Operating Mass (DOM) is the total mass of the aeroplane ready for a specific type of 
operation, excluding all usable fuel and traffic load. This mass includes:
•	 crew and their baggage.
•	 catering and removable passenger service equipment.
•	 potable water and lavatory chemicals.
•	 food and beverages.
•	 Traffic Load is the total mass of passengers, baggage and cargo, including any non-revenue 
load.
•	 The amount of fuel allowed for running the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), starting the engines, 
“push-back” and taxi to the take-off point is:
Maximum Ramp Mass (MRM) - Maximum Take-off Mass (MTOM)
63 060 - 62 800  =  260 kg 
Taxi fuel is roughly 11 kg/min. The APU burns 115 kg/h
•	 The maximum traffic load is:
MZFM - DOM
51 300  - 34 270    =    17 030 kg
Optimum Cruise Altitude
(Refer to CAP 697 Figure 4.1)
The optimum pressure altitude for best fuel mileage is presented for .78 Mach cruise, and Long 
Range Cruise (LRC) or .74 Mach. LRC is recommended for minimum trip fuel as it gives 99% of 
the maximum fuel mileage in zero wind. When cruising within 2000 ft of the optimum altitude 
LRC approximates to a .74 Mach cruise.
If the aircraft is flown above or below the optimum altitude for LRC or  .78 Mach Table 4.1 
tabulates the fuel penalty incurred as a % correction.
Example 1
Enter the Optimum Cruise Altitude table with the Cruise Mass (Weight) 56 800 kg, move 
vertically up to the selected cruise profile, LRC/.74 Mach or .78 Mach, and move horizontally to 
read the optimum cruise pressure altitude.

NB.  There are two axis on Fig 4.1 used for the Weight - Brake Release Weight (Take-off Weight) 
or Cruise Weight.  Be sure to get the right one!

The cruise distance for sectors of 235 NM or less is limited by those required for the climb 
and descent. The Short Distance Cruise Pressure Altitude table shows the maximum pressure 
altitude at which it is possible to cruise for at least a minute.
NB.  The only interpolation for ISA is done between +10°C and +20°C
Example 3:
Enter with the trip distance, 175 NM, and move to the temperature line, ISA +20°C; move 
horizontally to the Reference Line and follow the trade lines to intercept the vertical at the 
Brake Release Weight, 52 000 kg; move horizontally to read the optimum cruise pressure 
altitude:

Example 4:
Sector distance 150 NM, temperature at MSL take-off of 30°C and brake release weight 42 500 
kg. Calculate the maximum short distance cruise pressure altitude.

Medium Range Jet Transport (MRJT) Simplified Flight Planning
Simplified Flight Planning - Introduction
(Refer to CAP 697 Figures 4.3.1a to 4.4)
Simplified Flight Planning graphs are provided in the CAP 697 MRJT1 for: 
Three LONG RANGE CRUISE:   	
100 - 600    200 -1200  and  1000 - 3000 NM
Three 0.74 MACH CRUISE:           	
100 - 600    200 -1200  and  1000 - 3000 NM
Three 0.78 MACH CRUISE:           	
100 - 600    200 -1200  and  1000 - 3000 NM	
One 300 KIAS CRUISE:	
	
 0 - 1000 NM
One STEPPED CLIMB: 	   	
	
1000 - 4000 NM
One ALTERNATE PLANNING - LRC: 	 0 - 500 NM
One HOLDING FUEL PLANNING
The LRC, 0.74 Mach, 0.78 Mach and 300 KIAS Cruise graphs have the same presentation. 
The Simplified Flight Planning charts determine trip fuel and time from brake release to 
touchdown. APU usage, taxi, in-flight flaps down manoeuvring (other than straight in 
approach), Cost Index Adjustments and reserve fuel should be added to the trip fuel from 
these charts to obtain the total fuel required. Additional fuel for holding is obtained from the 
Holding Fuel Planning table. (CAP 697 Figure 4.4)
Simplified Flight Planning - Method
Example 5
LRC trip distance 1000 NM; cruise at FL290 with 50 kt headwind, ISA -10°C. Estimated landing 
weight 40 000 kg. Calculate the fuel required and flight time.
Enter with the trip distance and go vertically to the reference line. Follow the flow lines and 
correct for 50 kt headwind.
Move vertically from this point to the first 29 intersection of the Pressure Altitude lines. Move 
horizontally across to the Landing Weight reference line and follow the flow lines to correct 
for Landing Weight. 
Move horizontally across and extract the Fuel Required...................kg
Go back to the original vertical line and at the 29 intersection on the upper Pressure Altitude 
intersections move horizontally to the Trip Time reference line; follow the flow lines to 
ISA -10°C.
Move horizontally and read off the Trip Time..........h..........min
If the given wind component exceeds that on a chart, convert the trip distance to nautical 
ground miles (NGM) to nautical air miles (NAM) and ignore the head and tail flow lines:
NGM  ×  Average TAS 
TAS +/- Wind Component
NAM    =

Medium Range Jet Transport (MRJT) Simplified Flight Planning
Simplified Flight Planning - Additional Allowances
Cost Index Adjustment
The LRC Simplified Flight Planning charts are based upon climb, cruise and descent speeds 
which produce an approximate minimum trip fuel. If the flight is planned to operate with the 
Flight Management System (FMS) in the economy (ECON) mode adjustments to the trip fuel 
and time are necessary to account for the different flight profile; the table above itemizes 
these adjustments.
Ground Operations
Fuel may be saved by minimizing APU operation. The average APU fuel flow for normal 
operations is 115 kg/h (250 lb/h).
The taxi fuel allowance is 11 kg/min (25 lb/min).
Cruise - Air Conditioning (AC) Packs and Engine/Wing Anti-ice 
•	 AC packs at high flow: 	
	
Increase the trip fuel by 1%. 
•	 Anti-ice:	
Engine only	
	
Increase trip fuel by 70 kg/h
	
	
Engine and Wing	
Increase trip fuel by 180 kg/h.
Altitude Selection
The best fuel consumption for mileage at a given cruise profile is achieved at the optimum 
altitude. The fuel penalty for operations off the optimum altitudes is given by CAP 697 Table 
4.1 of section 4 page 1.
Descent
The Simplified Flight Planning charts assume a descent at 0.74 Mach/250 KIAS and a straight 
in approach.
For every additional minute of flaps down operation add 75 kg of fuel.
For Engine Anti-ice during the descent add 50 kg.
Holding Fuel (EU-OPS Final Reserve Fuel is extracted from this table)
The holding fuel is extracted from the HOLDING FUEL PLANNING table (Refer to CAP 697 
Figure 4.4). The chart is based upon a racetrack pattern at the minimum drag airspeed, with a 
minimum of 210 KIAS. Interpolation for weight and pressure altitude is required.
Example: An aircraft holding at a pressure altitude of 1500 ft with a weight, at the start of a 
30 minute hold, of 54 000 kg has a planned fuel flow of 2520 k/h. The expected fuel burn in 
the 30 minute hold is thus:
2520 ÷ 2 = 1260 kg. The aircraft weight at the end of the hold is 54 000 - 1260 = 52 740 kg.

En Route Climb
Refer CAP 697 MRJT1 Figure 4.5.1
The CAP 697 provide climb tables for a temperature range -15°C to 25°C. Fuel, time, distance 
(nautical air miles) and TAS are extracted against the intersection of Cruise Pressure Altitude 
and Brake Release Weight. Interpolation for intermediate levels and weights is required.
The fuel and time is from brake release and the distance from 1500 ft; the scheduled climb 
speed is 280 KIAS/.74 MACH
The tabulated TAS is the climb average and is to be used to convert nautical air miles to 
nautical ground miles:
NAM  ×  AVERAGE TAS  +/- WC

Cruise/Integrated Range Tables
Integrated range tables for Long Range Cruise, 0.74 and 0.78 Mach Cruise and Low Level 300 
KIAS Cruise are included in the CAP 697 MRJT1, pages 25 to 68. The same method of data 
extraction is used for all tables.
The tables use the “difference” principle, the difference in two weights being the fuel weight 
used for a sector. The corresponding difference in the tabulated distance equates to the still 
air distance for that weight of fuel. Thus, all ground distances affected by a wind component 
must be first converted to still air distances.
For convenience gross weights are tabulated at 100 kg intervals so that table values may be 
extracted without interpolation. For instance, using the table page 25 of CAP 697 MRJT1, a 
gross weight of 51 500 kg equates to a cruise distance of 3093 NAM; a cruise distance of 4420 
NAM equates to a gross weight of 59 600 kg.
The TAS for the 0.74 Mach and 0.78 Mach is tabulated at the top of each pressure altitude 
page; for LRC the TAS is found against the adjacent gross net weight figure.
Note the corrections to Fuel Flow and TAS, below each table, for Operation at Non-standard 
Temperatures
 General guidelines and tips to MRJT Integrated fuel tables
•	 There are 3 main cruise methods:
Long Range Cruise	 	
TAS is a function of aircraft mass
0.74 Mach	 	
	
TAS is constant for flight level
0.78 Mach	 	
	
TAS is constant for flight level
It is imperative that you pick the correct page for cruise method and flight level. They 
will NOT give you the page number in the exam, but will refer you to a figure number. 
For example:   Fig 4.5.3.1 then with the flight level you get the correct page.

Medium Range Jet Transport (MRJT) Detailed Flight Planning
•	 Tables using NAM: you are probably going to have to convert from/to NGM.
•	 Note there are corrections at the bottom of each page:
•	 Not interested in “thrust limiting” weights
•	 SHOULD have to adjust fuel calculated	
•	 ALWAYS adjust the initial TAS for temperature deviation
•	 Get TAS first, you will need it anyway and in multi-choice might reduce number of options.
•	 It is the difference in the aircraft mass at the first point compared to the second point that 
gives the fuel required.
•	 A picture of what is going on might help.
•	 The examples on the following pages are the sort of questions and level that the EASA 
require.
•	 If you forget what to do, page 24 of CAP 697 MRJT1 will remind you.

What is the TAS and fuel required?
	
Step 1	 Find correct page  -  31
	
Step 2	 TAS  =  433  +  10  =  443 kt
	
Step 3	 Convert the 1500 NGM into NAM	
	
Step 4	 Aircraft at “A” is 58 500 kg, enter the table with this mass and extract the cruise 
NAM of 4704 NM. 
	
Step 5	 4704 - 1348 NAM gives a cruise NAM at “B” of 3356.	
	
Step 6	 Enter table looking for a distance of 3356 NAM, you are unlikely to find exactly 
this figure but take the lower figure of 3354 and this corresponds to an aircraft 
mass of 51 000 kg when overhead “B”
	
Step 7	 The difference between 58 500 kg and 51 000 kg is 7500 kg and this is the fuel 
required. You should then increase the fuel required by 0.6% which is 45 kg 
giving a total of 7545 kg.

What is the TAS and fuel required?
	
Step 1	 Find correct page = 45
	
Step 2	 TAS = 438 - 20 = 418 kt
	
Step 3	 Convert the 500 NGM into NAM	
	
	
Step 4	 Aircraft at “A” is 54 400 kg, enter the table with this mass and extract the cruise 
NAM of 3612 NM. 
	
Step 5	 3612 – 568 gives a cruise NAM at “B” of 3044.
	
Step 6	 Enter table looking for a distance of 3.044 NAM, you are unlikely to find exactly 
this figure but take the lower figure of 3036 and this corresponds to an to 
aircraft mass of 51 100 kg when overhead “B”
	
Step 7	 The difference between 54 400 kg and 51 100 kg is 3300 kg and this is the fuel 
required. You should then decrease the fuel required by 1.2% which is 40 kg 
giving a total of 3260 kg.

What is the TAS, ground distance and Specific Fuel Consumption?
	
Step 1	 Find correct page = 59

Step 4	 Aircraft at “B” is 48 500 kg, enter table and extract the cruise 	
	
NAM of 2788 NM
	
Step 5	 3279 – 2788  =  491 NAM between “A” and “B”
	
Step 6	 Convert the 491 NAM into NGM	
	
	
Step 7	 Calculate the Specific Fuel Consumption. Strictly speaking though not as per the 
Performance definition, you need to remember that Specific Fuel Consumption 
or SFC is the fuel required divided by the ground distance flown. Specific Air 
Range is the fuel required divided by the air distance flown.

Wind light & variable
	
Cruising using 		
LRC @ FL310 	
	
The aircraft is to fly for 35 minutes
	
What is the fuel consumed from “A”?
	
Step 1	 Find correct page = 29
	
Step 2	 Correct the OAT -59°C into an ISA deviation  =  ISA-12°C
	
Step 3	 TAS = 437 - 12 = 425 kt
Note:	 As wind is light and variable you can assume that TAS and GS are both 425 kt and NAM 
and NGM will also be equal.
	
Step 4	 How far can you fly in 35 minutes at 425 kt = 248 NM
	
Step 5	 Aircraft at “A” is 55 500, enter the table with this mass and extract the cruise 
NAM of 4047 NM. 
	
Step 6	 4047 – 248 NAM gives a cruise NAM at “x” of 3799.
	
Step 7	 Enter table looking for a distance of 3799 nam, you are unlikely to find exactly 
this figure but, 3800 is close enough and this corresponds to an aircraft mass of 
54 100 kg 35 minutes after “A”
	
Step 8	 The difference between 55 500 kg and 54 100 kg is 1400 kg and this  the fuel 
required. Strictly speaking you should then decrease the fuel required by 0.72% 
which is 10 kg giving a total of 1390 kg.

Medium Range Jet Transport (MRJT) Detailed Flight Planning
Descent Table 
(Refer CAP 697 MRJT1 Figure 4.5.4a & 4.5.4b)
Time, fuel and distance (NAM) for a flight idle thrust descent are tabulated for:
•	 M 0.74/250 KIAS, which approximates to an economy descent, 
and
•	 M 0.70/280 KIAS, turbulent air penetration descent.
Allowances are included for a straight in approach with undercarriage down.
Increase fuel during the descent by 50 kg for engine anti-ice.
Example 5
Given a landing weight of 54 900 kg and a mean descent wind component of 50 kt head 
calculate the time, fuel and ground distance for a M 0.74 descent from FL330.
Fuel...........kg; time............min; distance...........NAM; ...........NGM.
Example 6
An aircraft with an estimated landing weight of 48 500 kg descends from FL310 to fly a straight 
in approach, through turbulent air with the engine anti-ice on; the wind component is 45 kt 
tail. Calculate the fuel burn, time and ground distance
Fuel..........kg; time............min; distance............NAM; ...........NGM.

fly a route where the overall magnetic variation is 15°W. The trip is to be flown at the lowest 
ICAO IFR optimum pressure altitude for M 0.78. Details are provided in the attached Flight 
Plan and all the airfields are less than 100 ft above mean sea level. The forecast QNH at the 
destination, E, is 1029 hPa.
Fuel:
Route:	 	
	
	
Allow 5% contingency A to E.
Descent: 	
	
	
Straight in descent with gear down with turbulence forecast. 
Diversion:	
	
	
Use Alternate Planning CAP 697 MJRT1 Figure 4.3.6.
	
	
	
	
estimated landing weight 47 000 kg. 
Taxi/APU: 	
	
	
Allow 20 min APU and 20 min Taxi.
Air Conditioning: 	
	
1% extra to cruise fuel to destination. 
Engine and wing anti-ice: 	
180 kg/h for cruise A to E.
Holding at E:	 	
	
Compute 45 min holding fuel, straight and level, at an altitude 
of 2000 ft overhead E. (CAP 697 Figure 4.4)
Assume an initial weight of 	 50 000 kg.
When complete, answer the following:
a.	
During the descent into E the pilot selected the flaps down 4 minutes before the ILS 
outer marker. What extra fuel was burnt? 
b.	
How much of the contingency fuel was used if the engine anti-ice was selected during 
the descent?
c.	
If the anti-ice, air conditioning and half the taxi/APU fuel have been burnt, what is the 
estimated landing weight at E?
d.	
If a LRC flight is planned to operate in the ECON mode what adjustments to fuel and 
time are needed if the Cost Index is 30?

Extended Twin Operations (ETOPS) - Introduction
The loss of a power unit, or certain major systems, by twin-engine Performance Class A aircraft 
whilst flying over water or remote areas, causes greater problems than similar events on aircraft 
with three or four engines. It is, therefore, necessary to limit the distance all such twin-engine 
aircraft (including those powered by turboprops and reciprocating engines) may be away from 
an adequate airfield. This distance equals one hour’s flight time, in still air and standard 
conditions, at the normal one-engine-inoperative cruise speed. 
Any operations planned to fly a twin-engine public transport aeroplane beyond this distance 
from an adequate aerodrome will be considered to be Extended Twin Operations (ETOPS). 
An operator may be authorized to conduct ETOPS with a particular airframe/engine combination 
within a particular area (for example the North Atlantic) where the maximum diversion time, 
from any point along the proposed route of flight to an adequate aerodrome, is up to 180 
minutes or less (90, 120 or 138 minutes) at the normal one-engine-inoperative cruise speed 
(under standard conditions and in still air). These areas will be specified on the permission 
issued by the Regulatory Authority for the purpose of approving ETOPS. An operator shall not 
conduct operations beyond the threshold distance determined in accordance with EU-OPS 
1.245 unless approved to do so by the Authority and prior to an ETOPS flight an operator 
shall ensure that a suitable ETOPS en route alternate is available within the appropriate 
diversion time.
ETOPS - Definitions
Extended Twin Operations are those operations intended to be, or actually, conducted over 
a route that contains a point further than one hour’s flying time (in still air) at the normal 
one-engine-inoperative cruise speed from an adequate aerodrome. When, alternatively a 
Threshold Distance has been agreed with the Authority, all non-ETOPS flights shall remain 
within the threshold distance of an adequate aerodrome.
ETOPS Segment is the portion of an ETOPS flight that begins when the aeroplane is first 
more than the threshold distance from any adequate aerodrome (ETOPS Entry Point) and ends 
when the aeroplane is last more than the threshold distance from any adequate aerodrome 
(ETOPS Exit Point).
Normal One-engine-inoperative Cruise Speed. An operator shall determine a speed for the 
calculation of the maximum distance to an adequate aerodrome for each two-engine aeroplane 
type or variant operated, not exceeding VMO, based upon the true airspeed that the aeroplane 
can maintain with one engine inoperative under certain conditions. See EU-OPS 1.245 (b) for 
determination of this speed, which is only intended to be used to establish the maximum 
distance from an adequate aerodrome. 
Threshold Time is 60 minutes. 
(Before granting an extension to the threshold time the Licensing Authority considers 
the following factors: propulsion system reliability record, modification and maintenance 
programme, flight dispatch requirements, training evaluation programme, operations 
limitation and specifications, operational validation flight and continuing surveillance and 
engine reliability monitoring.)
--- Page 116 ---
MRJT Additional Procedures

MRJT Additional Procedures
Threshold Distance is the distance travelled in still air in 60 minutes by an aircraft at the normal 
one-engine-inoperative cruise speed.
Rule Time is the maximum time that any point on the route may be from a suitable aerodrome 
for landing, as specified by the Authority and included in the operations manual.
Rule Distance is the distance travelled in the rule time, at the normal one-engine-inoperative 
cruise speed.
Adequate Airfield. In general terms an operator may make an appraisal that an aerodrome 
has long enough runways, and is sufficiently equipped, to be considered adequate for his 
planned ETOPS routes. In particular it should be expected that at the anticipated time of use:
•	 The aerodrome will be available and equipped with the necessary ancillary services, such as 
ATC, sufficient lighting, communications, weather reporting, navaids and safety cover, and
•	 At least one let-down aid (ground radar would so qualify) will be available for an instrument 
approach.
Suitable Airfield. The commander must satisfy himself on the day, using criteria provided by the 
operator, that he has sufficient adequate aerodromes which, taking into account the weather 
and any equipment unserviceabilities, are suitable for his intended operation. An aerodrome 
shall only be selected as an ETOPS enroute alternative when the appropriate weather reports 
or forecasts, or any combination thereof, indicate that, between the anticipated time of 
landing until one hour after the latest possible time of landing, conditions will be at or above 
the planning minima.
ETOPS - Minimum Equipment List (MEL)
Primary system redundancy levels appropriate to ETOPS will be reflected in the MEL. For 
aeroplanes in operational service the existing MEL will be re-evaluated and adjusted as 
necessary to reflect the primary system redundancy levels required for ETOPS. Primary 
airframe systems are those which have a fundamental influence on flight safety and could 
be adversely affected by the shutdown of a power unit. 
Examples are:
Electrical/battery, Hydraulic, Pneumatic, Flight Instrumentation, Fuel, Flight Control, Ice 
Protection, Engine Start and Ignition, Propulsion System Instruments, Navigation and 
Communications, APUs, Air Conditioning and Pressurization, Cargo Fire Suppression, 
Emergency Equipment, Engine Fire Detection and Extinguishing Systems and any other 
equipment for ETOPS.

ETOPS - Communication and Navigation Facilities
An aeroplane shall not be dispatched on ETOPS unless:
•	 Communication facilities are available to provide, under all expected conditions of 
propagation at the normal one-engine-inoperative cruise altitudes, reliable two-way voice 
communications between the aeroplane and the appropriate air traffic control unit over 
the planned route of flight and routes to any suitable alternate to be used in the event of 
diversion; and,
•	 Non-visual ground navigation aids are available and located so as to provide, taking account 
of the navigation equipment installed in the aeroplane, the navigation accuracy required 
over the planned route and flight altitude, and the routes to any alternate and altitudes to 
be used in the event of diversion for whatever reason; and,
•	 Approved visual and non-visual aids are available at the specified alternates for the 
authorized types of approaches and operating minima.
ETOPS - Fuel Policy Pre-flight
An operator shall ensure that the pre-flight calculation of usable fuel required for a flight 
includes:
•	 Taxi fuel
•	 Trip fuel
•	 Reserve fuel consisting of:
•	 Contingency
•	 Alternate fuel, if a destination alternate is required
•	 Final reserve fuel (for aeroplanes with turbine power units, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at 
holding speed at 1500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions), 
and,
•	 Additional fuel, if required by the type of operation (e.g. ETOPS), and,
•	 Extra fuel if required by the commander

MRJT Additional Procedures
ETOPS - Fuel Policy In-flight
An operator shall ensure that in-flight replanning procedures for calculating usable fuel 
required when a flight has to proceed along a route, or to a destination other than originally 
planned, includes:
•	 Trip fuel for the remainder of the flight.
•	 Reserve fuel consisting of:
•	 Contingency fuel.
•	 Alternate fuel, if a destination alternate is required.
•	 Final reserve fuel (for aeroplanes with turbine power units, fuel to fly for 30 minutes at 
holding speed at 1500 ft (450 m) above aerodrome elevation in standard conditions), 
and
•	 Additional fuel, if required by the type of operation (e.g. ETOPS), and
•	 Extra fuel if required by the commander.
ETOPS - Critical Fuel
In general an aeroplane shall not be dispatched on an ETOPS flight unless it carries sufficient 
fuel and oil; and in addition, such additional fuel and oil as may be required to fly to a suitable 
aerodrome for landing in the event of the shutdown of a engine, or in the event of airframe 
system failure(s), which may require diversion to an alternate. It should be assumed that this 
event occurs at the most critical point in terms of overall fuel and oil requirements along 
the planned route of flight. Thus for ETOPS operations the “Trip fuel for the remainder of the 
flight” will be the CRITICAL FUEL i.e the fuel from the most Critical Point (CP)/Equal Time Point 
(ETP) to the diversion aerodrome based upon a consideration of three possible events:
•	 Simultaneous failure of an engine and the pressurization (this is the worst scenario) An 
emergency descent down to FL100 at VMO/MMO with the speed brakes extended and cruise 
to the diversion airfield at LRC speed. 
•	 Total pressurisation failure (but no engine failure). An emergency descent down to FL100 
at VMO/MMO with the speed brakes extended and cruise to the diversion airfield at LRC speed.
•	 Engine failure (but no pressurization failure). Descent and cruise will be initiated at the 
selected speeds and stabilizing level. 
The fuel required will be the greatest of the All-engine and two Single-engine cases. This 
amount is then compared to the fuel planned to be on the aircraft at the most critical CP/ETP; 
if it is greater than the planned amount then additional fuel must be uplifted.

ETOPS - Chart Calculation of the Most Critical Point
Figure 8.2 shows how the most critical point (CP/ETP), i.e. the one based upon the two 
alternates furthest along track, is derived. It is based upon the Critical Line between airfields at 
C and E which is found by extending the bisector of the line between C and E to cut the ETOPS 
track.
Thus, the distances from this intersection to either C or E are equal, and, in still air conditions, 
the flight time at the one-engine-inoperative TAS will also be equal.
Assume:
One-engine-inoperative cruise TAS 400 kt.
690 NM, from C and E Critical Line intersection with the ETOPS track, to airfield C or E.
Mean forecast wind velocity 230/85, for flight to C or E at planned one-engine-out stabilizing 
pressure level.
Therefore:

Back-plot a wind vector from the Critical Line intersection with the ETOPS track, in the direction

The intersection of this Equal Line with the ETOPS track is the most limiting ETOPS ETP/CP.
Thus:
•	 At this position it is the same engine-out flight time to airfields at C or E, 
	
and
•	 The flight planned fuel from this point must be equal to or greater than the Critical Fuel 
to C or E. If it is not then the extra fuel required must be loaded.

ETOPS – CAP 697 MRJT1
CAP 697, Pages 72 to 75
CAP 697 Figures 4.7.1a & 1b provide the CRITICAL FUEL RESERVE (LRC) for ONE ENGINE 
INOPERATIVE and ALL ENGINES OPERATIVE at the Critical Point. If this fuel reserve is greater 
than the planned fuel at this point, the fuel load must be increased accordingly. Both graphs 
are based on the following common parameters: 
•	 Pressurization failure
•	 Emergency descent to 10 000 ft. Level cruise at 10 000 ft 
•	 250 KIAS descent to 1500 ft over the airfield
•	 15 minutes hold at 1500 ft. One missed approach, approach and land
•	 5% allowance for wind errors
The One Engine Inoperative graph also includes Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) fuel burn. Thus, 
this is the worst case scenario (engine and pressurization failure) which requires the APU to 
be started in flight in order to compensate, in part, for the loss of the power plant to provide 
essential electrics and pneumatics (e.g. air conditioning).
Note the corrections, beneath each graph, for:
•	 Temperatures hotter than ISA. 
•	 Icing conditions.
Example 1
An aircraft at a weight of 48 000 kg suffers an engine and pressurization failure simultaneously. 
The forecast conditions at FL100 are +5°C and a 50 kt headwind for the 850 NM distance from 
the CP to the diversion airfield. Calculate the LRC Critical Fuel Reserve needed.

Example 3
An aircraft at a weight of 50 000 kg has an engine and pressurization failure simultaneously.

Area of Operation - Diversion Distance
CAP 697 Figure 4.7.2
The area of operation is defined as the region within which the operator is authorized to 
conduct ETOPS. The distance to the diversion airfield from any point along the route must be 
flown within the approved time using the single-engine cruise speed, assuming still air and ISA 
conditions.
The maximum diversion distance used to establish the area of operation may be obtained from 
this chart.
Method:
Enter the chart with the appropriate speed and weight at the point of diversion. Select the 
appropriate time.
Read off the maximum diversion distance.

In-flight Diversion (LRC) - One Engine Inoperative
Refer to CAP 697 Figure 4.7.3 
This graph is a simple method of determining the fuel required and time for the flight from 
a diversion point to a selected alternate. It is based upon one engine inoperative and NO 
pressurization failure, with the aircraft drifting down to cruise at its selected level.
Example 6
The one-engine-inoperative, LRC, diversion distance to the alternate is 940 NM at a weight of 
60 000 kg; wind component 50 kt head, cruise FL260 and ISA Dev. +20°C. Determine the fuel 
required and diversion time.
Enter the graph with the diversion distance, move vertically to the WIND REF LINE and follow 
the curved flow lines to the value 50 Head. 
From this position go vertically to the PRESSURE ALTITUDE 1000 ft slope of 26 and move 
horizontally to the WEIGHT AT POINT OF DIVERSION REF LINE.
Follow the curved flow lines to intercept the 60 000 kg value and from here go horizontally to 
extract the FUEL REQUIRED .................... kg.
Return to the intersection of the vertical distance/wind line with the PRESSURE ALTITUDE.
1000 ft slope of 26 and continue vertically to intercept the second PRESSURE ALTITUDE.
1000 ft slope of 26 and move horizontally to the ISA DEV (°C) REF LINE.
Follow the temperature slope and read off the time...............h..........h.........min.
(Note: The solid line = 6000 ft, the dashed line = 26 000 ft, therefore, interpolation is required).
Example 7
The One-engine-inoperative, LRC diversion distance to the alternate is 400 NM at a weight of 
60 000 kg; wind component 100 kt tail, cruise FL60 and ISA Dev. +10°C. Determine the fuel 
required and diversion time.

Fuel Tankering
CAP697 MJRT1 Figures 4.8.1 & 4.8.2 
When the cost of fuel at the destination airfield is greater than that at the departure, the LRC 
or .74 Mach Fuel Tankering graphs may be used to determine if it is economical to carry fuel 
in excess of that required for the flight; a large percentage of this extra fuel can then be used 
for the return flight or another sector. These charts should only be used if the cruise altitude 
capability is not adversely affected by tankering.
To obtain the smaller, but potentially significant, percentage of the surplus fuel that will be 
burnt, due to the increased gross weight of the aircraft resulting from the tankered fuel, the 
entering values for each graph are:
•	 Trip distance NAUTICAL AIR MILES
•	 Cruise pressure altitude
•	 Landing weight (WITHOUT TANKERING)
The LRC example (Figure 4.8.1) shows that, for a trip of 1600 NAM at FL330 and 42 500 kg 
Landing Weight (Without Tankered Fuel), if excess fuel is carried 13.2% of it will be consumed 
as a fuel penalty, due to the aircraft’s higher gross weight.
For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than 
the break even fuel price. The Fuel Price Differential Graph (Figure 4.8.2) presents the Break 
Even Fuel Price Destination Airport for any Surplus Fuel Burn percentage and Fuel Price at 
Departure Airport; the fuel price is quoted as cents/US.gal.
Using the 13.2% Surplus Fuel Burn in the example and a Departure Airfield Fuel Price of 100 
cents the Break Even Fuel Price Destination Airport is 116 cents.
Example 11
An aircraft is planned to fly a LRC at FL350, ISA -10°C, at an average gross cruise weight of 
55 000 kg and a Landing Weight (Without Tankered Fuel) of 47 500 kg; the wind component is 
-30 kt and the trip distance 1600 NGM. Calculate:
a.	
The % Surplus Fuel Burn.

b.	
The Break Even Fuel Price Destination Airport if the Fuel Price at Departure Airport is

Tankered Fuel) of 40 000 kg. The sector distance is 1050 ngm, wind component +35 kt. Calculate:

Computer Flight Plans - Introduction
The majority of airlines use computer flight planning, either their own systems or those 
provided, for example, by SITA or Jeppesen. The following is representative of the type of 
information programmed into a computer database:
Co-ordinates and identification of all likely navigation beacons, waypoints and airfields. 
Meteorological data, which is automatically loaded from a main International Met. Office (e.g. 
Bracknell).
The airline’s standard routes.
ATC routes, airways, SIDS and STARS, and the twice daily North Atlantic Tracks which are 
automatically loaded.
The operator’s fuel management data and policy.
The structural limits and performance details of all the aircraft types operated.
Airfield dimensions and meteorological information in order that the regulated take-off and 
landing performance data can be calculated.
The operator’s preferred alternate airfield data.
The operator’s fuel costing policy.
The operator’s preferred aircraft operating method. For example: Long Range Cruise, High 
Speed Cruise, Cruise Climb, Constant Mach No.
Most computer systems require the minimum basic information to provide a flight plan:
Examples of required information:
	
Aircraft type	
	
Block time
	
Departure and 	
Destination.
	
Cruise mode	
	
Traffic load required
However great care must be taken to ensure that the correct information is loaded. Remember-
“garbage in, garbage out”.

Computer Flight Plans - Checking Accuracy
Never assume that computer plans are correct invariably; errors can, and do, occur; particularly 
if the wrong information has been loaded into the computer. Check the information to see if 
it is sensible. Experienced pilots, who fly regularly a series of routes soon become familiar with 
route patterns, their seasonal fuels, times and distances, and can quickly spot a duff computer 
plan. Check that:
•	 It is up to date and using the latest forecasts
•	 The fuel amounts and flight times make sense for the time of year
•	 The track directions and distances are sensible
•	 The wind velocities and average wind component tally with the meteorological forecast
•	 The alternates chosen are acceptable
•	 The method of cruise control is appropriate
If the route is a new one, or one rarely flown, then refer to the aircraft’s Simplified Fuel Planning 
Data to verify the computerized plan or use agreed “Rules of Thumb” based upon average fuel 
flows and cruise TAS/ground speeds.

Introduction
The Jeppesen VFR + GPS (Visual Flight Rules + Global Positioning System) Chart GERMANY 
ED - 6 EDITION 1999 is the reference for Part-FCL 033 01 00 00, FLIGHT PLANS FOR CROSS-
COUNTRY VFR FLIGHTS. 
The chart is a Lambert Conformal Conic Projection with standard parallels of N37° and N65°; 
its scale is 1/500 000 with elevations in feet. It is designed for VMC Flight in accordance with 
VFR. It is effective below FL125 in Austria, FL115 in France, FL100 in Germany and FL150 in 
Switzerland. The Isogonic lines are valid for 1999; see top of the chart at E008° 55’ and E012° 
15’. The Highest Spot Elevation is 12 028 ft at N4707.4 E01220.8. Identification of adjacent 
charts is provided at the diagram top left-hand corner of the chart.
World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84)
The co-ordinates of VFR REPORTING POINTS, AERODROMES and RADIO NAVIGATION AIDS 
use the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84). e.g.
STUTTGART NDB = N4842.7 E00920.1
See the right-hand panels of the chart.
Example 1
a.	
What are the WGS84 co-ordinates of FOXTROTT 2 VFR Reporting Point in the Munchen 
Control Zone (CTR)?
b.	
What are the WGS84 co-ordinates and ICAO designator for Innsbruck International 
aerodrome?
c.	
State the Radio Navigation Aid, its frequency, call sign, co-ordinates and magnetic 
variation for MOOSBURG.
Answers can be found on page 141
Track (Course) - Measurement of Direction and Distance
TRUE DIRECTION is measured by placing the centre of a protractor over the midpoint of the 
track, aligning its north/south axis parallel to the nearest meridian and reading off the track 
direction in °(T). If the MAGNETIC direction is required the mean variation for the track is 
found by interpolation between the appropriate isogonals, updated as necessary for the mean 
annual change, and applying it to the true track direction as follows:
	
VARIATION WEST (+)	     -  	
MAGNETIC BEST 
	
VARIATION EAST (-)	      -	
MAGNETIC LEAST
DISTANCE in nautical miles is measured either by using the NEAREST MERIDIAN SCALE or the 
NAUTICAL MILE SCALE at the bottom of the chart; this latter scale has a Kilometre and Statute 
Mile Conversion. Thus:
60 NM = 111.1 km (60 × 1.852)

Aeronautical Information
•	 AIRPORTS depicted on the chart are shown with their ICAO four-letter code, location name, 
elevation in feet, longest runway available in metres and tower communication frequency; 
(v) indicates that VHF Direction Finding (VDF) is available.
•	 WAYPOINT INFORMATION. Compulsory and Non-compulsory Reporting Points are shown 
on the chart with their assigned name.
•	 NAVAID INFORMATION provides a navigational aid’s frequency and identification; their 
co-ordinates are tabulated at the side of the chart.
•	 TYPES OF AIRSPACE
When planning a flight the various types of airspace and their restrictions must be considered.
•	 RESTRICTED, DANGER and PROHIBITED AREAS on the chart are depicted as shown.
•	 RESTRICTED AREA - Airspace of defined dimensions within which the flight of aircraft is 
restricted in accordance with certain specified conditions.
•	 DANGER AREA - Airspace which has been notified as such within which activities 
dangerous to the flight of aircraft may take place or exist at such times as may be notified.
•	 PROHIBITED AREA - Airspace of defined dimensions within which the flight of aircraft is 
prohibited.
Topographical Information
Note the symbols for natural high points, given in feet, and the Terrain Contour Tints, given in 
feet and metres. At the bottom right of the chart is a FEET METRE CONVERSION scale.
1 m = 3.28 ft
MINIMUM GRID AREA ALTITUDE (GRID MORA) figures are shown within each half degree of 
latitude and longitude; two noughts should be added:
47 = 4700 ft
The resulting value provides a clearance of all terrain by 1000 ft in areas where the highest 
point is 5000 ft or lower and 2000 ft where the highest point is 5001 ft or more.

Establishment of Minimum Flight Altitudes
(Ref. EU-OPS 1.250)
When selecting a Flight Altitude/Level which gives adequate clearance for a given sector the 
following should be considered:
•	 The accuracy with which an aircraft can determine its position.
•	 The inherent inaccuracies of altimeters and their indications plus corrections required to 
account for temperature and pressure variations in relation to ISA.
•	 The characteristics of the terrain.
•	 Rotor turbulence and standing waves.
•	 The accuracy of the navigational chart.
•	 The vertical extensions of Danger, Restricted and Prohibited areas. (Avoid them if they 
cannot be overflown).
•	 The vertical extensions of the types of airspace.
•	 The highest ground or obstacle within the promulgated distances either side of the planned 
track.
•	 The ICAO Standard Semi-circular Cruising Levels. (See Figure 9.1)
The Minimum Grid Area Altitudes (Grid MORA)
These are printed on the chart have already been referred to. These could be used:
•	 As a rapid means of assessing the appropriate Flight Level/Altitude.
•	 As a means of cross-checking terrain clearance values that have been obtained using the 
stated methods.
•	 As a rapid means of re-assessing safe clearance of terrain, e.g. when a pilot becomes unsure 
of his exact position in relation to his intended track.
Students will be required to find the highest obstacle within a given distance either side of 
track. Normally the distance will be 5 NM either side of track

Topographical Chart
Choosing Cruising Levels
(See Figure 9.1 and bottom of the chart)
Figure 9.1  ICAO semi-circular cruising levels
The choice of safe Flight Level is determined by the aircraft’s planned Magnetic track (not 
heading), stated obstacle clearance allowance and regional forecast route QNH. For VFR flight 
for SEP and MEP aircraft the BELOW FL290 VFR diagram, top right of Figure 9.1, is the reference. 
Flight Levels for a track between 0°M and 179°M are odd levels plus 500 ft; for tracks between 
180°M and 359°M they are even levels plus 500 ft.
(When choosing levels for the Medium Range Jet Transport (MRJT) aircraft, the IFR BELOW 
FL290 and AT AND ABOVE FL290 will be the reference for IFR flight).

Altimeter Errors and Corrections
An altimeter is calibrated in relation to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).
A mean sea level pressure and temperature of 1013.25 hPa and +15°C, and a mean temperature 
lapse rate of 2°C (1.98°C)/1000 ft up to 36 090 ft, where it remains constant at -56.5°C.
Thus, when calculating the height increment/decrement in feet from an airfield to an aircraft’s 
Flight Level (pressure altitude), which is based upon the above standard conditions, the 
differences in pressure and temperature between the actual and ISA conditions must be 
accounted for.
Pressure Difference
The initial pressure setting for take-off will be QNH, which when set on the altimeter subscale 
causes it to indicate the aircraft’s altitude (airfield elevation) above mean sea level at take-off, 
disregarding instrument error.
On passing the transition altitude the standard pressure setting of 1013.25 hPa is set on the 
altimeter subscale. The difference between 1013.25 hPa and the airfield QNH will result in a 
barometric error, height loss or gain, in the order of 30 ft/hPa.
Figure 9.2   1013.25 hPa > QNH - less height gained
--- Page 141 ---

Topographical Chart

Topographical Chart
Figure 9.3   1013.25 hPa < QNH - more height gained
Temperature Difference from ISA at Cruising Pressure Level
The standard temperature for an aircraft flying at FL85, for example, is - 2°C. If the Corrected 
Outside Air Temperature (COAT) is -15°C the aircraft is flying in air colder and denser than 
standard; as pressure decreases more rapidly in a column of colder air the altimeter will over 
read. Conversely, when the COAT is warmer than standard the air is less dense and the altimeter 
will under read. Therefore when 1013.25 hPa is set:
LOWER COAT - altimeter OVER READS
HIGHER COAT - altimeter UNDER READS
The “ALTITUDE” window on the reverse of the CRP5 is used to correct for the difference in 
temperatures. Using the CRP5:
Set FLIGHT LEVEL (85) against COAT (-15°C) in the “ALTITUDE” window; read off TRUE 
ALTITUDE (8100) in feet on the OUTER SCALE against FLIGHT LEVEL (85) on the INNER SCALE. 
Thus the altimeter is over reading by 400 ft.
If FL85 had been chosen to provide a 1000 ft clearance above an obstacle at 7500 ft AMSL 
within the stated limits on the aircraft’s planned sector, then the actual clearance would be 
600 ft. A safer level to accord with ICAO VFR Semi-circular Cruise Levels would thus be FL105.
Consider an aircraft flying at FL75 (ISA 0°C), with a COAT of +16°C:
Set FLIGHT LEVEL (75) against COAT (+16°C) in the “ALTITUDE” window; read off TRUE 
ALTITUDE (7925) in feet on the OUTER SCALE against FLIGHT LEVEL (75) on the INNER 
SCALE. The altimeter will under read by 425 ft:

Topographical Chart
In this instance FL75 was chosen to provide a clearance of 1000 ft above an obstacle of 6500 ft 
AMSL. The actual clearance is thus 1425 ft.
Hence remember the adage in relation to temperature (and pressure):
“High to low mind how you go”

Introduction
To prepare for the examination students will need Jeppesen’s “Student Pilot Route Manual 
for Part-Flight Crew Licensing”, or an equivalent approved publication; the selected Jeppesen 
charts are NOT current and are NOT to be used for navigation. The manual contains more 
charts than are usually required for the examinations.
For the examination students will, for example, be expected to:
•	 Select routes, and decode and explain the meaning of the symbols, from en route, area, 
departure arrival and airfield charts.
•	 Extract, from the above charts, tracks, distances, heights/altitudes, magnetic variation, and 
frequencies/call signs of navigation facilities etc.
•	 Compute heading, ground speed and elapsed time.
•	 Select the correct flight level(s) for track direction(s) and obstacle clearance.
•	 Complete a part of a Navigation Plan/Navigation Log.
•	 Identify airspace classifications and restricted areas.
•	 Extract Instrument Approach Minima at destination and alternate aerodromes.
You will provide the manual for the examinations; thus, during the examination you may use 
the legend. However, because the allotted time for answering the questions is limited, you 
must be familiar with the ABBREVIATIONS, CHART GLOSSARY and the most commonly 
used symbols from the CHART LEGENDS, all of which are included in the INTRODUCTION to 
the manual.
Jeppesen Manual (JM) - Chart Glossary
The glossary provides:
Unique ICAO definitions commonly used in Jeppesen publications; FAA (USA) terms are 
included when different from ICAO. It is recommended that these definitions, particularly the 
ICAO ones, are carefully studied and committed to memory. The following ICAO definitions 
should be noted:
AERODROME ELEVATION. The elevation of the highest point of the landing area. 
ALTITUDE. The vertical distance of a level, point or an object considered as a point, measured 
from mean sea level.
DECISION ALTITUDE (DA) or DECISION HEIGHT (DH). A specified altitude or height in the 
precision approach at which a missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference 
to continue the approach has not been established. DA is referenced to mean sea level; DH is 
referenced to the threshold elevation.
ELEVATION. The vertical distance of a point or a level, on or affixed to the surface of the earth, 
measured from mean sea level.
--- Page 154 ---
Airways
10
148
10
Airways
FLIGHT LEVEL (FL). A surface of constant atmospheric pressure which is related to a specific 
pressure datum 1013.2 hPa, and is separated from other such surfaces by specific pressure 
levels.
HEIGHT. The vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured 
from a specified datum.
MINIMUM DESCENT ALTITUDE/HEIGHT. A specified altitude/height in a non-precision 
approach or circling approach below which descent may not be made without visual reference,
THRESHOLD.   The beginning of that portion of the runway usable for landing 
TRANSITION ALTITUDE. The altitude at or below which the vertical position of the aircraft is 
controlled by reference to altitudes.
TRANSITION LAYER. The airspace between the transition altitude and the transition level.
TRANSITION LEVEL. The lowest flight level available for use above the transition altitude.
The glossary also provides Abbreviations which relate to the information included in the 
manual’s charts and aviation in general. Continuous reference to the abbreviations, in 
conjunction with the various charts and enclosed examples and exercises, will facilitate the 
retention of their meanings in the student’s memory. Note the following ICAO abbreviations:
QFE. The atmospheric pressure at aerodrome elevation, or at runway threshold.
QNH. The altimeter subscale reading to obtain elevation when on the ground 
(Ref. ICAO Doc 8168-OPS/611 Vol. 1, 5th Edition 2006, Chapter 1)
QNE is the height indicated on landing at an aerodrome when the altimeter subscale is set to 
1013.2 hPa.
(Ref. Handbook of Aviation Meteorology 3rd Edition, 1994, HMSO)
“When 1013.2 hPa is set on the subscale the height indicated on the pressure altimeter with 
the aircraft on the ground is known as the QNE value. This setting is used for some high 
level aerodromes where the QFE would be so low as to be outside the limits of the subscale 
setting. (The setting of 1013.2 hPa is sometimes referred to, incorrectly, as the QNE).”
(Ref. CAP 390 ATC Training Manual section 2-Meteorology).
The Jeppesen definition of QNE is: Altimeter setting 29.92”Hg or 1013.2 hPa.

JM - En Route Chart Legend
The legend is for use in conjunction with the enclosed charts, the majority of which use 
the Lambert Conformal Conic projection and are designed primarily for airway instrument 
navigation using cockpit instruments, radio communications and ground based radio 
navigation aids. It should be noted that not all symbols apply in all areas and that symbols in 
green are printed in green on two-colour charts; all symbols are blue on single-colour charts. 
Detailed examples and exercises based upon the legend and various charts are provided later 
in this chapter. A general discussion follows on the legend which is divided into the following 
classifications.
Navaid Symbols
Note the symbols for:
VOR (Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range).
Terminal VOR.
TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation) or DME (Distance Measuring Equipment).
VORTAC/VORDME.
NDB (Low and Medium Frequency Non-directional Beacon).
ILS (Instrument Landing System). KRM course is a Russian localizer equivalent.
MLS (Micro-wave Landing System).
Fan Markers.
Broadcast Stations.
Navaid Identification
The shadow box is used when the navaid is associated with an airway or route. Off-airway 
navaids are un-boxed except that off-airway VORs are boxed on other than US and Canadian 
charts.
Communications
Radio frequencies for communication are printed above the Navaid name to indicate that voice 
communication is available through the navaid. Radio frequencies in the 120 MHz range are 
shown with the numbers “12” omitted, e.g. 122.2 and 122.35 are shown as 2.2 and 2.35.
Navaid/Communications Data
This section shows how a navaid’s operational status is depicted; the availability of a TWEB 
(continuous weather broadcast); an SABH radio beacons’ primary function is to transmit 
continuous automatic weather information; R = En route radar available; H + 04 & 15 (1) means 
that a Marine NDB begins transmission at four minutes passed the hour and at 15 minute 
intervals thereafter and each transmission lasts for 1 minute.

Restricted Airspace/Restricted Airspace Designation
A knowledge of the symbols and abbreviations for the various types of restricted airspace is 
essential.
Airports
Memorize the symbols for civil and military airfields.
Airway and Routes and Centrelines
A knowledge of the meaning of these symbols is required. In particular note the depiction of:
Airways.
Types of reporting points.
LF bearings (to the navaid) and radials (from the navaid). 
Holding patterns.
Airway Information
Note: in particular, the different designations of airways and routes and minimum clearance 
limits. For example:
V168. Victor (VOR airway) routes/airways are found on US and Canadian Low Level charts, 
which are effective up to, but not including, 18 000 ft MSL.
J71. Jet routes/airways are for high performance aircraft. They are effective at and above 
18 000 ft MSL to FL450 in the US and at and above 18 000 ft MSL to unlimited in Canada.
A1. European countries use the phonetic alphabet.
Minimum En route IFR Altitude (MEA)
The lowest published altitude between radio fixes that meets obstacle clearance requirements 
between those fixes and in many countries assures acceptable navigational signal coverage. 
The MEA applies to the entire width of the airway, segment or route between the radio fixes 
defining the airway, segment or route.
Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA)
The lowest published altitude in effect between radio fixes on VOR airways (i.e. below 18 000 
MSL), off-airway routes or route segments which meet obstacle clearance requirements for 
the entire route segment and in the USA assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only 
within 22 NM of a VOR.
Minimum Off-route Altitude (MORA)
This is an altitude derived by Jeppesen. The MORA provides known obstacle clearance within 
10 NM of the route centre line.

151
Airways
10
Airways
Maximum Authorized Altitude (MAA)
A published altitude representing the maximum usable altitude or flight level for an airspace 
structure or route segment.
E  means that even altitudes/flight levels, in thousands of feet, are used in the arrow’s direction 
and odd altitudes/flight levels in the opposite; contrary to ICAO Semi-circular rules.
O  means that odd altitudes/flight levels, in thousands of feet, are used in the arrow’s direction. 
It is used only on one-way airways.
E  and O indicates that all altitudes, even and odd, are available in the indicated direction.
PPR  means that Prior Permission is Required from ATC for flight in the arrow’s direction.
Airway Navaid/Reporting Point Bypass
The symbols depicting the bypassing of a navaid or reporting point should be noted.
Boundaries
Students need to be familiar with the boundary symbols.
Controlled Airspace & ICAO Airspace Classifications 
Reference to the symbols in conjunction with the exercises in this chapter will enable the 
student to become familiar with the symbols for the above.
ICAO Airspace Classification is designated by the letters A to G:
Class A: IFR flights only are permitted; all flights are subject to ATC service and are separated 
from each other.
Class B: IFR and VFR flights are permitted; all flights are subject to ATC service and are separated 
from each other.
Class C: IFR and VFR flights are permitted and all flights are subject to ATC service and IFR 
flights are separated from other IFR flights and from VFR flights.
Class D: IFR and VFR flights are permitted and all flights are subject to ATC service; IFR flights 
are separated from other IFR flights and receive traffic information in respect of VFR flights; 
VFR flights receive traffic information in respect to all other flights.
Class E: IFR and VFR flights are permitted; IFR flights are subject to ATC service and are 
separated from other IFR flights. All flights receive traffic information as far as is practicable.
Class F: IFR and VFR flights are permitted; all participating IFR flights receive an air traffic 
advisory service and all flights receive flight information service if requested.
Class G: IFR and VFR flights are permitted and receive flight information service if requested.
Note the depiction, with airspace classification, of Terminal Control Area (TMA), Control Area 
(CTA) and Control Zone (CTR).

Orientation/Border Information & Miscellaneous
The location of airfields, navaids and reporting points, etcetera, on the charts can be readily 
plotted by reference to the latitude and longitude grid.
The isogonals are indicated at the edge of a chart or extended fully across the chart in a 
continuous dashed line.
Shorelines and large inland lakes are shown. The Border and Miscellaneous information should 
be noted.
The Grid Minimum Off-route Altitude (Grid MORA) values clear all terrain and man-made 
structures by 1000 ft in areas where the highest elevations are 5000 ft AMSL or lower. MORA 
values clear all terrain and man-made structures by 2000 ft in areas where the highest 
elevations are 5001 ft amsl or higher. When a Grid MORA is shown as “Unsurveyed ” it is 
due to incomplete or insufficient information. Grid MORA values followed by +/- denote 
doubtful accuracy, but are believed to provide sufficient reference point clearance.
High Altitude Chart Legend
This legend’s symbols are additional and are applicable to the High Altitude Charts; preceding 
legend symbols also apply to the charts.
Area Charts
This legend is applicable to Area Charts and is additional to the preceding legends. Students 
must familiarize themselves with the Area Chart symbols as questions will be posed on them in 
the examination. Note the symbols for:
Departure and arrival routes.
Speed Limit Point.
Man-made structures.
Depiction of communication frequencies.
Area Charts - Generalized Terrain Contours
Terrain information may be depicted on area charts when terrain within the area chart coverage 
rises more than 4000 ft above the main airport; see Madrid Area Chart. The absence of terrain 
contours does not imply the absence of terrain or structures. The contour information does 
not assure clearance above or around terrain or man-made structures. There may be higher 
uncharted terrain or man-made structures within the vicinity. Terrain information is useful 
for visual orientation and general visualization of terrain. It does not replace the minimum 
altitudes dictated by the airway and air route structure.
JM - SID and STAR Legend
As the examination will include questions on selected Standard Instrument and Standard 
Terminal Arrival charts the student must have a thorough knowledge of this legend.
The charts provide a graphical (i.e. not to scale) illustration of the governing authority’s 
prescribed procedures.

JM - Approach Chart Legend
As with the SIDs and STARs questions will be set in the examination on selected Approach 
Charts. Students are advised to become as conversant as possible with the layout and content 
of this comprehensive legend. The subdivisions of this legend, which are a potential source of 
examination questions, are:
•	 Landing Minimums.
•	 Airport Chart Format and Plan View.
•	 Additional Runway Information.
•	 Lighting Systems.
•	 Take-off and Alternate Minimums.
•	 GPS Approach Charts
•	 ICAO recommended airport signs and runway markings.
Air Traffic Services (ATS) Routes/Standard Routes
(Ref: Current UK AIP ENR 1 and ENR 3)
In the United Kingdom ATS Routes are based upon significant geographical points which may 
or may not coincide with the location of a radio navigation aid. These significant points can be 
found in column 1 of the table at ENR 3.
Unless stated otherwise an airway is 5 NM either side of a straight line joining each two 
consecutive points shown in column 1 of the table. Upper ATS routes and Advisory Routes 
have no declared width but for the purposes of ATS provision are deemed to be 5 NM either 
side of a straight line joining each two consecutive points. The vertical extent is shown in 
column 3 of the table.
ENR 3 is divided into:
•	 LOWER ATS ROUTES which have an upper limit of FL245.
Ref. E(LO)1: See B1 ATS route, 279 and 085 radials from WAL VOR/DME at N5323.5 
W00308.0.
•	 LOWER ATS ROUTES - (ATS ADVISORY ROUTES). These have a maximum upper limit of 
FL240. The route designator for an Advisory Route always ends with D, e.g. A1D, N562D.
Ref. E(LO)1: See W911D Advisory Route, 242 and 058 radials from IOM VOR/DME N5404.0 
W00445.7
Note: Advisory Routes, class F airspace, are thus not established within Controlled Airspace 
and are designated routes along which Air Traffic Advisory Service is available. An Air Traffic 
Advisory Service is a service provided within advisory airspace to ensure separation, in so far as 
is practical, between aircraft which are operating on IFR flight plans.

Airways
Controlled Airspace is airspace of defined dimensions within which Air Traffic Control Service 
is provided to IFR and VFR flights in accordance with the airspace classification A, B, C, D and E. 
Thus an Air Traffic Control Service provides the much more complete service of:
•	 Preventing collisions between aircraft.
•	 Preventing collisions on the manoeuvring area between aircraft and obstructions.
•	 Expediting and maintaining an orderly flow of air traffic.
•	 LOWER ATS ROUTES - (CONDITIONAL ROUTES (CDR)).
These routes are usable only under specified conditions. (See ENR 1.1.1.1 para 1.5 and ENR 
3.2.2.1)
•	 UPPER ATS ROUTES from FL245 to FL460. The route designator is always preceded by U, 
e.g. UA1, UB40.
Ref. E(HI)4: See UG1 Upper ATS route, 295 and 111 radials from STU VOR/DME N5159.7 
W00502.3.

a.	
i)	
 Heathrow Director, Approach Control Radar available, frequency 119.72MHz.
	
ii)	
The altimeter setting information is given in hectopascals (inches on request). 
The runway elevation of 3 Hpa (3 mb), which equals 90 ft roughly, is the barometric 
pressure equivalent for the QFE altimeter setting. This value is subtracted from the 
reported QNH setting to obtain QFE. The height reference datum will be the runway 
threshold elevation (Rwy), airport elevation (Apt) or the runway touchdown zone 
elevation (TDZ), as applicable.
	
iii)	
The transition altitude 6000’ based on QNH and 5923’ based on QFE; the 
difference, 77’, equates to the elevation of the runway touchdown point.
b.	
i)	
The Instrument Approach Chart Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA), supplied by 
the controlling authority, is the minimum safe altitude which provides up to 1000’ 
obstacle clearance within a 25 NM radius from the navigational facility upon which 
the MSA is predicted. If the radius is other than 25 NM it is stated. This altitude is for 
emergency use only and does not necessarily guarantee navaid reception. When the 
MSA is divided into sectors, with each sector a different altitude, the altitudes in these 
sectors are referred to as “minimum sector altitudes”

LOC: Not available without the ILS DME.
Initial and intermediate approach valid up to 220 kt IAS. ILS DME reads zero at 
threshold of runway 27.
d.	
The ILS localizer frequency is 109.5 MHz; the ILS call sign is ILL and the * = part-time 
operation.
e.	
IAF = Initial Approach Fix based upon the BOVINGDON VOR/DME, frequency 113.75 
MHz, call sign BNN. D = Distance Measuring Equipment available. When the BNN VOR/
DME is unserviceable use the position at BOVVA which is defined by the 321 radial at 
32 NM from the Biggin VOR/DME (see JM STAR 10-2A).
f.	
The Missed Approach Holding is based upon the CHILTERN Non-directional Beacon 
(NDB)/Locator, call sign CHT, frequency 277 kHz; race-track pattern inbound 293°(M) 
to the overhead then left turn outbound onto 113°(M).

threshold or aerodrome elevation as applicable, used in establishing compliance with 
appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. For a precision approach procedure (i.e. ILS 
localizer and glide slope serviceable) it is the lowest altitude or height above the 
relevant runway threshold, at which a missed approach must be initiated to ensure 
compliance with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. (Ref. ICAO Doc 8168, 1993)
m.	
TCH 56’ = ILS glide slope threshold crossing height.
n.	
Final Approach Fix (FAF) 7.5 NM DME range from the runway threshold, 8.7 NM DME 
range from LON VOR/DME; 2500’ (2423’) is the minimum glide slope intercept altitude 
or height.
o.	
Glide slope altitude (1405’) and height (1328’) at 4 NM ILS ILL DME range from 
touchdown.
p.	
The M symbol and arrow signifies the non-precision approach (i.e. localizer only 
serviceable, no glide slope information) Missed Approach Point (MAPt/MAP). The 
arrow without the dashes means the applicable Decision Altitude or Height (DA/H) 
for the precision approach ILS procedure (localizer and glide slope serviceable).
q.	
The DA/H is 277’ (QNH)/200’(QFE); the MDA/H for the localizer only (glide slope out)
approach is 490’ (QNH)/413’ (QFE).
r.	
The missed approach is: “Climb straight ahead to 3000’ (2923’) then as directed by ATC 
(Max IAS 185 kt). In the event of complete radio failure see 11-7.”
s.	
Non-precision Approach and landing operations. An instrument approach and landing 
which does not utilize electronic glide path guidance, i.e. localizer only ILS, VHF Omni- 
range (VOR), Non-directional Beacon (NDB), VOR/DME, etc., approaches.
	
Minimum Descent Altitude/Height (MDA/H). A specified altitude/height in a non- 
precision approach or a circling approach below which descent may not be made 
without visual reference.
	
Precision Approach and landing operations. An instrument approach and landing 
using precision azimuth and glide path guidance with minima as determined by the 
category of operation, i.e. ILS, MLS and Precision Approach Radar (PAR).
	
Decision Altitude/Height (DA/H) is a specified altitude or height in the precision 
approach at which a missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference 
to continue the approach has not been established; DA is referenced to mean sea level 
(QNH) and DH to the threshold elevation (QFE). The required visual reference means 
that section of the visual aids or of the approach area which should have been in view 
for sufficient time for the pilot to have made an assessment of the aircraft position and 
rate of change of position, in relation to the desired flight-path.
	
Runway Visual Range (RVR) is the maximum distance a pilot 15 ft above the runway 
in the touchdown area can see marker boards by day or night when looking in the 
direction of take-off or landing. (ref. Meteorology book).

FL90 = Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA) expressed as a Flight Level. An MEA is 
the lowest published altitude between radio fixes that meets obstacle clearance 
requirements between those fixes and in many countries assures acceptable navigational 
signal coverage. The MEA applies to the entire width of the airway, segment or route 
between the radio fixes defining the airway, segment or route.
	
1900a = the Jeppesen Route Minimum Off-route Altitude (MORA). This altitude 
provides reference point clearance within 10 NM of the route centre line (regardless of 
route width) and end fixes. MORAs clear all reference points by 1000’ in areas where 
the highest reference points are 5001’ AMSL or lower and 2000’ where reference points 
are 5001’ or higher.
16.	
19 = Grid Minimum Off-route Altitude (Grid MORA). An altitude derived by Jeppesen 
or provided by State Authorities. The Grid MORA altitude provides terrain and man-

Atlantic Polar High Altitude
En Route Chart 5AT(HI) - Introduction
This chart is used primarily for planning routes and high altitude polar navigation between 
Europe and North America. All operations between Europe and the Canadian Arctic Control 
Area, between FL280 and FL390 inclusive, are strongly recommended to flight plan in 
accordance with the POLAR TRACK STRUCTURE (PTS) during:
•	 1200 - 1800Z for traffic to Alaska.
•	 0000 - 0600Z for traffic to Europe.
Reference: NORTH ATLANTIC MINIMUM NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION (MNPS) 
AIRSPACE MANUAL EIGHTH EDITION states that:
The PTS consists of 10 fixed tracks in the Reykjavik Control Area (CTA) and 5 fixed tracks 
through Bodø Oceanic Control Area (OCA), which are a continuation of the relevant PTS tracks 
in the Reykjavik CTA.
Projection
Its projection is POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC:
•	 Bearings are correct.
•	 Great Circles are straight lines in Polar Regions.
•	 Scale is constant and correct in Polar Regions.
Track Direction/Magnetic Variation/Distance
Track direction is given or measured as: TRUE (T), MAGNETIC (M), GRID (G). Grid navigation 
is covered later in the chapter.
The lines of equal magnetic variation, isogonals, are valid for 1995. On this chart the North 
Magnetic Pole is located approximately at N78 W100. There is a rapid change of magnetic 
variation in this area and the directive force, which aligns a compass needle with the magnetic 
meridian, reduces to zero as the magnetic pole is approached. Thus, in high latitudes magnetic 
reference for direction is impractical. Also, VOR beacons cannot be referenced to local magnetic 
north.
Example:
Resolute Bay VOR, 112.1 MHz, YRB (N7443.7 W09455.4) is aligned with local true north.
Distances are printed parallel to the track segments. Other distances can be measured using 
the nearest meridian scale, or the scale printed at the top, left and right edges of the chart. 
Note that 1inch = 100 NM.

STN(N5812.4 W00611.0) UN615, MATIK(N6100.0 W00804.0) PTS 1, N6600.0 W01230.0 [66PR].
a.	
The Magnetic track and distance STN to MATIK is .........................
b.	
The Magnetic track MATIK to STN is ...................
c.	
The True track and distance MATIK to [66PR] are ..........................
d.	
The True track [66PR] to MATIK is ...................
e.	
The Grid track and mean magnetic variation MATIK to [66PR] are .......................
f.	
The Grid track and distance [66PR] to MATIK are ........................
Example 2
a.	
The magnetic variation at KARLL(N7000.0 W15100.0) is .................
b.	
The magnetic variation at EUREKA NDB, YEU, 205 kHz (N7959.5 W08553.9) is ................
It can be seen that on the sector MATIK to [66PR] the return track 156°(T) is not a reciprocal of 
the outbound track 340°(T). However, the return track 169°(G) is almost the reciprocal of the 
outbound 348°(G). (The 1° difference is due to the fact that the track between the two points 
is not a straight line).
Therefore, to measure and fly a track that has an unchanging direction GRID NORTH must be 
used as the datum.

Grid Navigation 
The use of true and/or magnetic references for navigation in high latitudes is impractical due 
to:
•	 The rapid convergence of the meridians as latitude increases causing true track direction to 
change rapidly over short distances.
•	 The rapid change of magnetic variation over short distances.
•	 The degraded directional capability of magnetic compasses.
Therefore, to measure and maintain a track that has a constant direction GRID NORTH is used 
as a datum.
On this chart (and similar Polar Stereographic charts) the Greenwich Meridian is selected as the 
grid north datum; it is highlighted by a thick blue line and paralleled East and West at 300 NM 
intervals.
Example 3
(Reference Jeppesen chart 5AT(HI))
Track from A (N8500.0 E04000.0) to B (N8500.0 W04000.0).
a.	
The true track direction at A is ..................
b.	
The true track direction at N8500 E/W0000 is ..............
c.	
The true track into B is ................	
(Note the change of direction over 388 NM)
To obtain a constant track direction the grid north datum is used.
d.	
The grid track A to B is .................
The angular difference between True and Grid direction at any point on a grid chart is known 
as Convergence:
TRUE NORTH - WEST OF GRID NORTH = WESTERLY CONVERGENCE.
TRUE NORTH - EAST OF GRID NORTH = EASTERLY CONVERGENCE.
Hence:
CONVERGENCE WEST, TRUE BEST (GRID LEAST)
CONVERGENCE EAST, TRUE LEAST (GRID BEST)
Conveniently, on a POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC chart:
CONVERGENCE = LONGITUDE WITH SIGN CHANGED
--- Page 194 ---
Airways - Miscellaneous Charts
11
188
11
Airways - Miscellaneous Charts
Thus with reference to Figure 11.1:
LONGITUDE at A = 40°E = 40°W CONVERGENCE
LONGITUDE at B = 40°W = 40°E CONVERGENCE
Therefore:
The Grid Track at A (Longitude 40°E) = 310°(T) - 40°W Convergence = 270°(G).
The Grid Track into B (Longitude 40°W) = 230°(T) + 40°E Convergence = 270°(G).
Where the track crosses the Greenwich Meridian Convergence = 0°.
True and Grid tracks are the same - 270°
The bottom right-hand corner of panel 9 of the chart provides a simplified method of 
calculating a GRID BEARING:
 +    LONGITUDE WEST
GRID BEARING  =  TRUE BEARING
-    LONGITUDE EAST

c.	
The midpoint line cuts the Shannon/Gander track at position ............ and is ............ NM 
from each.
d.	
The midpoint line cuts the Gander/Keflavik track at position ............ and is ............. NM 
from each.
e.	
The midpoint line cuts the Keflavik/Shannon track at position ........... and is ............ NM 
from each.
It should be noted that any point on the extended MIDPOINT LINE, either side of the MIDPOINT, 
will be equidistant from either airfield and will be the STILL AIR ETP/CP.
At 90° to either side of each MIDPOINT LINE is a graticule which is used to adjust the STILL AIR 
ETP/CP, either in the continuing (ON) or returning (HOME) direction, for the prevailing wind 
pattern.

ATC Flight Plan
Introduction 
References: ICAO Doc 4444-RAC/501; UK AIP ENR 1.10-FLIGHT PLANNING (25 Jul 13)
What is an ATC Flight Plan?
It is simply advance notice of a pilot’s intentions for a flight in terms of route (including departure 
and destination), cruising level and speed and information about the crew and passengers. It 
is in a set format to ensure completeness of information and compatibility with electronic data 
transfer between ATS and other units.
Students are required to understand, and answer questions on, all aspects of ATC Flight Plans, 
both individual and Repetitive Flight Plans (RPLs).
•	 Type of plan - individual or repetitive
•	 The format of an ICAO flight plan.
•	 The information required for the plan.
•	 How to complete, file, cancel or amend a flight plan.
Definitions
Flight plan: Specified information provided to air traffic service units, relative to an intended 
flight or portion of a flight of an aircraft.
Repetitive flight plan (RPL): A flight plan related to a series of frequently recurring, regularly 
operated individual flights with identical basic features, submitted by an operator for retention 
and repetitive use by ATS units. These flights must be operated on the same day(s) of consecutive 
weeks and on at least 10 occasions, or every day over a period of at least 10 consecutive days. 
The elements of each flight shall have a high degree of stability.
Filed flight plan: The flight plan as filed with an ATS unit by the pilot or a designated 
representative, without any subsequent changes.
Current flight plan: The flight plan, including changes, if any, brought about by subsequent 
clearances.
Estimated elapsed time: The estimated time required to proceed from one significant point 
to another.
Estimated off-block time: The estimated time at which the aircraft will commence movement 
associated with departure.
Estimated time of arrival: For IFR flights, the time at which it is estimated that the aircraft 
will arrive over that designated point, defined by reference to navigational aids, from which 
it is intended that an instrument approach will be commenced, or, if no navigational aid is 
associated with the aerodrome, the time at which the aircraft will arrive over the aerodrome. 
For VFR flights, the time at which it is estimated the aircraft will arrive over the aerodrome.

Annexes to This Chapter
•	 Annex 1 to this chapter is a copy of Part II, Chapter 8, Doc 4444, relating to the rules for 
ATC flight plans.
•	 Annex 2 to this chapter, INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE FLIGHT PLAN 
FORM, is an extract of Appendix 2, Doc 4444.
These annexes should be studied carefully as they may be a source of examination questions.
Specimen CA48
Reference Figure 12.1 and Annex 2 to this chapter.
The numbered items at Figure 12.1 should be referred to in conjunction with the apposite 
instructions at Annex 2.
For example: 	 Item 7 AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION in Figure 12.1
Briefly, the instructions for ITEM 7: AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION at Annex 2, 
state that the aircraft identification should not exceed 7 characters and can be 
either the registration markings of the aircraft or the ICAO designator for the 
operating agency.
ITEMS 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 18, and 19 can be readily understood from the instructions.
ITEM 15: ROUTE is more complex and will be discussed later.
Decode of Specimen Flight Plan
The aircraft identification is BAW805, (Speedbird 805 being the radio-telephony identification). 
IFR Scheduled flight for a Boeing 737, which creates a Medium wake turbulence.
The 
aircraft 
has 
a 
serviceable 
Standard 
communication/navigation/approach 
aid 
equipment for the route and a serviceable SSR transponder with 4096 codes and Mode C.

ATC Flight Plan
The aircraft plans to join the airway UR14 and fly along it to the Strumble VOR, call sign STU, 
where it changes to airway UG1, and thence to the navigation facility at Woodley, call sign 
WOD. From WOD it plans to fly direct, DCT, to Ockham VOR, call sign OCK.
The destination aerodrome is London Heathrow, EGLL, with a total planned flight time of 50 
minutes, 0050; the alternate airfield is Birmingham, EGBB.
The aircraft registration is GBGJG, and it requires special handling as it is a Hospital, HOSP, 
aircraft. The estimated elapsed time, EET, to the London FIR boundary, EGTT, is 15 minutes, 
0015, after take-off.
Item 19: Supplementary Information 
(NOT TO BE TRANSMITTED IN FPL MESSAGE). This information is only required when an 
aircraft is overdue and the emergency services have been alerted.
The total endurance of the aircraft is 2 h 30 min, 0230, and there are 103 persons on board.
The aircraft is fitted with separate emergency UHF, U and VHF, V, radio, together with a crash 
activated emergency locator beacon, E.
The aircraft is carrying maritime, M, survival equipment and life jackets, J, fitted with a sea 
activated light, L, and fluorescent dye, F.
The aircraft also carries 10 inflatable dinghies, D, whose total capacity is 150 people; the colour 
of dinghies’ covers, C, is yellow.
The aircraft has blue and grey markings and the pilot in command is Yendle.
Item 15
This is the most complex. Details are required of the aircraft’s route, change of route, speed, 
level and/or flight rules; sub-items must be in capital letters and separated by a space. The 
following aide-memoire may be of use for filling in the ROUTE details which start after the 
arrow.
•	 ATS ROUTE (2 to 7 characters)
•	 Enter the coded designator assigned to the route or route segment e.g. UB37, R14.
•	 Where appropriate enter the coded designator assigned to a standard instrument 
departure route (SID) or standard arrival route (STAR) e.g. OCK 1C, MAY 1J.
•	 POINTS OF CHANGE (2 TO 11 CHARACTERS)
Enter:
•	 The coded designator (2 to 5 characters) assigned to the point, e.g. EX, MAY, LOVEL, 
PORGY, SCROD.

6010N06206W or,
•	 BEARING AND DISTANCE from a navigation aid:
For example SAM090035 indicates a point 35 NM on a bearing of 090°(M) from 
Southampton VOR.
	
Use of DCT (Direct)
•	 If a departure airfield is located or connected to the ATS route then the coded designator 
of that route will be the first entry. If it is not on or connected to the ATS route the first 
entry will be DCT followed by the joining point, followed by the designator of the ATS 
route. (Figure 12.2)
•	 If the destination airfield is not on or connected to an ATS route the last entry will be 
DCT. (Figure 12.3)
•	 Use DCT between coded designators not connected by ATS routes.
•	 Use DCT between a designated reporting point and a position, denoted by a latitude 
and longitude or a bearing or distance from a navaid, which is outside the ATS route.
•	 Use DCT between a latitude and longitude, or a navaid bearing and distance, and a 
designated reporting point on an ATS route.
•	 DCT is not required between successive points defined by latitude and longitude or a 
bearing and distance from a navaid. (Figure 12.4)
•	 Only points of change are to be entered in item 15. Insert each point at which there is a 
change of:
•	 Route.
•	 Speed or level. A change of speed is 5% of TAS or 0.01 Mach or more. If there is a change 
of level or speed both must be entered even though only one has changed. (See Figure 
12.5).
•	 Flight rules.
•	 Follow the point of change with the designator of the ATS route even if it is the same as 
that before the change, or by DCT if the next point is outside the ATS route.

ATC Flight Plan

ATC Flight Plan
Annex 1  -  Flight Plan
Extract from ICAO DOC 4444 (PANS - RAC) Dated 22 Nov 2007
Flight plan form
A flight plan form based on the model in Appendix 2* should be provided for and used by 
operators and air traffic services units for the purpose of completing flight plans.
(* Appendix 2 in this instance is found at page A2-1 PANS-RAC Doc 4444. Copies are also 
included in this chapter.) Note: A different form may be provided for use in completing 
repetitive flight plan listings.
The flight plan form should be printed and should include an English text in addition to the 
language(s) of the State concerned. Note: The Model Flight Plan Form in Appendix 2 is printed 
in English and one other of the languages of the Organization for illustration purposes.
Operators and air traffic services units should comply with the instructions for completion of a 
flight plan form and a repetitive flight plan listing form given in Appendix 2. 
Note: The instructions for completing a flight plan form given in Appendix 2 may be conveniently 
printed on the inside cover of flight plan form pads, or posted in briefing rooms.
An operator unable to satisfy a prescribed route or area RNP* should, prior to departure, 
advise ATC of the RNP* types the aircraft is certified to meet.
(* Required Navigation Performance (RNP) is a statement of the navigation performance 
accuracy necessary for operation within a defined airspace. RNP type is a containment value 
expressed as a distance in NM from the intended position within which flights would be for 
at least 95% of the total flying time. For example RNP 4 represents a navigation accuracy of 
+/- 4 NM on a 95% containment basis)
Submission of a Flight Plan
Prior to departure
Except when other arrangements have been made for submission of repetitive flight plans, a 
flight plan submitted prior to departure should be submitted in person or by telephone to the 
air traffic services reporting office at the departure aerodrome. If no such unit exists at the 
departure aerodrome, the flight plan should be submitted by telephone or typewriter, or if 
these means are not available, by radio to the unit serving or designated to serve the departure 
aerodrome.
In the event of a delay of thirty (30) minutes in excess of the estimated off-block time for a 
controlled flight or a delay of one hour for an uncontrolled flight for which a flight plan has 
been submitted, the flight plan should be amended or a new flight plan submitted and the old 
flight plan cancelled, whichever is applicable.
During flight
A flight plan to be submitted during flight should normally be transmitted to the aeronautical 
telecommunication station serving the air traffic services unit in charge of the flight information 
region, control area, advisory area or advisory route in or on which the aircraft wishes to fly. 
When this is not practicable, it should be transmitted to another aeronautical telecommunication 
station for retransmission as required to the appropriate air traffic services unit.

ATC Flight Plan

12
ATC Flight Plan
Note:   If the flight plan is submitted for the purpose of obtaining air traffic control service, 
the aircraft is required to wait for an air traffic control clearance prior to proceeding under 
the conditions requiring compliance with air traffic control procedures. If the flight plan is 
submitted for the purpose if obtaining air traffic advisory service, the aircraft is required to wait 
for acknowledgement of receipt by the unit providing the service.
Acceptance of a Flight Plan
The first air traffic services unit receiving a flight plan, or a change thereto, shall:
•	 Check it for compliance with the format and data conventions
•	 Check it for completeness and, to the extent possible, for accuracy
•	 Take action, if necessary, to make it acceptable to the air traffic services, and
•	 Indicate acceptance of the flight plan or change thereto, to the originator
General
RPLs (Repetitive Flight Plans) shall not be used for flights other than IFR flights operated 
regularly on the same day(s) of consecutive weeks and on at least ten consecutive occasions or 
every day over a period of at least ten consecutive days. The elements of each flight plan shall 
have a high degree of stability.
Note: Permissible incidental changes to RPL data affecting the operation for one particular day 
are not intended to be a modification of the listed RPL.
RPLs shall cover the entire flight from the departure aerodrome to the destination aerodrome. 
RPL procedures shall be applied only when all ATS authorities concerned with the flights have 
agreed to accept RPLs.
The use by States of RPLs for international flight shall be subject to the provision that the 
affected adjacent States either already use RPLs or will use them at the same time. The 
procedures for use between States shall be the subject of bilateral, multilateral or regional air 
navigation agreement as appropriate.
Changes to RPL Listings
Changes of a permanent nature
Changes of a permanent nature involving the inclusion of new flights and the deletion or 
modification of currently listed flights shall be submitted in the form of amendment listings. 
These listings shall reach the air traffic services agency concerned at least seven days prior to 
the change becoming effective.
Changes of a temporary nature
Changes of a temporary, non-recurring nature relating to RPLs concerning aircraft type and 
wake turbulence category, speed and/or cruising level shall be notified for each individual 
flight as early as possible and not later than 30 minutes before departure to the ATS reporting 
office responsible for the departure aerodrome. A change of cruising level only may be notified 
by radio-telephony on initial contact with the ATS unit.
In the case of an incidental change in the aircraft identification, the departure aerodrome, the 
route and/or the destination aerodrome, the RPL shall be cancelled for the day concerned and 
an individual flight plan shall be submitted.

ATC Flight Plan
12
ATC Flight Plan
Whenever it is expected by the operator that a specific flight, for which an RPL has been 
submitted, is likely to encounter a delay of 30 minutes or more in excess of the off-block time 
stated in that flight plan, the ATS unit responsible for the departure aerodrome shall be notified 
immediately.
Note: Because of the stringent requirements of flow control, failure by operators to comply with 
this procedure may result in the automatic cancellation of the RPL for that specific flight at one 
or more of the ATS units concerned.
Whenever it is known to the operator that any flight, for which an RPL has been submitted, is 
cancelled, the ATS unit responsible for the departure aerodrome shall be notified.
Operator/pilot Liaison
The operator shall ensure that the latest flight plan information, including permanent an 
incidental changes, pertaining to a particular flight and duly notified to the appropriate 
agency, is made available to the pilot in command.

Point of Equal Time (PET)
Introduction
Figure 13.1  All-engine Point of Equal Time (critical point)
The Point of Equal Time (PET), or sometimes referred to as Critical Point (CP) or Equal Time 
Point (ETP), is that track position, in relation to two suitable airfields, from which it is the same 
time for an aircraft to fly to either. These two airfields could be the departure and destination 
airfields, or any two airfields situated suitably in relation to the aircraft’s track.
The PET allows the pilot to decide quickly which of the two diversion airfields is the closer in 
time if there is a failure of an engine or a major system, or other event such as a serious illness 
on board. The fuel loaded for a flight (trip fuel, contingency allowance, holding and alternate 
fuel etc.) will be sufficient always for the aircraft to fly from the PET to either nominated 
airfield. The PET is a time problem. To make the time HOME from the PET equal to the time 
ON from the PET the two distances will be different, unless there is zero wind; in which case 
they are equal.
Routes over the oceans or remote parts of the world, where, in the event of an emergency, 
there is a scarcity of suitable en route diversions within reasonable flying time from any point 
on the proposed track, may necessitate the calculation of a PET between departure and 
destination airfields and those en route that are adequate.
For instance, a limit has been set on the distance a twin may be from an adequate airfield. This 
distance will be equal to one hour’s flight time, in still air, at the normal one-engine-inoperative 
cruise speed. Any operation planned beyond this distance from an adequate aerodrome is 
considered to be Extended Range Operations (EROPS) or Extended Twin Operations (ETOPS). 
Approved ETOPS requires the calculation of PETs between adequate airfields.

•	 In still air the PET is HALFWAY
•	 If there is a wind then the PET moves INTO WIND
•	 The stronger the wind the greater the movement INTO WIND
•	 A gross error check.  If you have a headwind component outbound the PET has to be 
more than halfway between departure and destination

Engine Failure PET
Figure 13.4  Engine failure Point of Equal Time
The loss of a power unit will necessitate invariably a “drift down” to a stabilizing pressure 
altitude where the aircraft will either continue ON, or return HOME, at the reduced engine 
failure TAS/GS, depending on whether the failure occurred before or after the ETA (computed 
at the all-engine TAS/GS) for the engine failure PET. If the engine failure happened at the PET 
then, in theory, the pilot could choose to fly to either airfield as the flight times are equal.

With reference to Figure 13.5 fill in the ground speed rectangles and calculate the distance and 
time to the engine failure PET.

380 - 45 = 335

2050 × 335 
370 + 335

974 NM @ GS out 520 = 112.5 min
The difference in distance between an all-engine and engine failure PET can be seen to be 
very small, even though in these two examples there was a difference in all-engine and engine 
failure TAS of 95 kt. Thus an engine failure PET is normally constructed, which may then be 
used for serious occurrences other than power unit failure.
To calculate the distance X to an engine failure PET use the engine failure TAS to calculate O 
and H in the formula.
To calculate the distance X to an all-engine PET use the all-engine TAS to calculate O and H in 
the formula.
To calculate the time to fly to an all-engine or an engine failure PET use the all-engine TAS to 
calculate the ground speed from the departure point to the PET.

Point of Safe Return (PSR)
Introduction
Figure 14.1  Point of safe return
The POINT OF SAFE RETURN (PSR), previously referred to as the POINT OF NO RETURN 
(PNR), is the furthest point along a planned route to which an aircraft can fly and return to 
the departure airfield, or departure alternate, within the SAFE ENDURANCE of the aircraft. 
SAFE ENDURANCE is the length of time an aircraft can fly without consuming the mandatory 
reserves of fuel that are required overhead its departure airfield, or departure alternate, in 
the event of the aircraft returning from the PSR. This SAFE ENDURANCE, quoted as a period 
of time (or an amount of fuel) is used to calculate the PSR. It must not be confused with the 
TOTAL ENDURANCE, the time an aircraft can remain airborne, at the end of which the tanks 
are empty.
If the state of the weather, runway, let-down aids or political situation at a destination airfield 
is likely to deteriorate and the only recourse would be to return back to the departure airfield, 
or departure alternate, it is prudent to calculate a PSR. Normally, the calculation of a PSR 
would only be necessary for flights to an “isolated destination and no adequate destination 
alternate exists”. Occasions on which a PSR may be required might include flights from 
mainland airfields to destinations such as Easter Island, Cocos Island, Tahiti, Ascension Island 
and the Azores.
In flight, at a reasonable time before the ETA for the PSR, the pilot checks that the destination 
airfield’s weather, landing aids and runway state are acceptable for a period of usually one 
hour before to one hour after the destination ETA.
The distance OUT to the PSR equals the distance HOME from the PSR. The time OUT to the 
PSR and time HOME from the PSR will be the same in zero wind; if there is an overall wind 
component the time OUT and time HOME will be unequal. But, in each case, the two values 
total the Safe Endurance time.

(Answer 1458 NM)
•	 In still air the distance to the PSR is the greatest.
•	 Any wind component reduces the distance to the PSR.
•	 This distance is the same for a HEAD or TAIL wind of the same value.
•	 The greater the wind component the greater the reduction in the distance to the PSR.

Point of Safe Return (PSR)
Derivation of the Formula for Variable Fuel Flows
In the preceding examples Safe Endurance was quoted in hours and minutes. If it is given as 
an amount of fuel then the following formula, which takes into account individual sector fuel 
flows altitudes, temperatures, wind components and engine configurations, may be used:
LET	
d	
=	
Distance to the PSR
	
F	
=	
Fuel available (less reserves) for calculation of the PSR
	
CO	
=	
The fuel consumption OUT to the PSR, kg/NM
	
CH	
=	
The fuel consumption HOME from the PSR, kg/NM
	
Consumption in kg/NM is usually obtained by: 
FUEL FLOW 
GROUND SPEED
Or 	
SECTOR FUEL 
SECTOR DISTANCE
FUEL USED TO THE PSR + FUEL USED HOME FROM THE PSR = F
Therefore:	
dCO + dCH	
=	
	
F 
	
	
d(CO + CH)	
=	
	
F 
	
	
d	
 	
=	
      
F 
CO + CH
Example Variable Fuel Flows PSR - Single Sector
TAS 310 kt; wind component out to the PSR +30 kt. Total fuel available less reserves 39 500 kg; 
fuel flow out to PSR at FL270 is 6250 kg/h; fuel flow home from the PSR at FL310 is 5300 kg/h. 
Calculate the distance and time to the PSR.
CO	
=	
6250 kg/h 
340 kt
	 =	
18.38  kg/NM
CH	
=	
5300 kg/h 
280 kt
	 =	
18.93  kg/NM
D 	
=	
39 500 kg 
18.38 + 18.93	 =	
1059 NM
Time to PSR	
= 1059	@ 340 kt 	
 =   3 h 7 min
Answer  =  1059 NM 3 h 7 min
